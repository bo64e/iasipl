<p><em>Oh, it's just so doggone thin.</p>
<p>Oh, it's incredibly thin.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's thin, sure,</em> but I got to say, I don't care for it.</p>
<p>Charlie, the thinner the TV, the better the TV.</p>
<p>That's just a straight-up fact.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys!</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>We got a review in the paper.</p>
<p>No way! Is it a good review?</p>
<p>"The first thing I noticed about Paddy's Pub is its charm".</p>
<p>All right, it's a good review.</p>
<p>That's a good start.</p>
<p>"It has none".</p>
<p>Uh-oh, are you serious?</p>
<p>"There was an ominous feeling that you could get stabbed at any moment". That's good, right?</p>
<p>How is that good?</p>
<p>That's the exact type of atmosphere I've been trying to cultivate.</p>
<p>But, while danger may linger, I'm the levelheaded bouncer that keeps violence in check, like Swayze in Roadhouse. I'm the cooler.</p>
<p>In check? There have been many stabbings in here.</p>
<p>I feel unsafe here every single day.</p>
<p>Oh, very often.</p>
<p>Well, stabbings have been down, though.</p>
<p>Read some more.</p>
<p>"When I ordered a glass of wine, not only did the surly" white trash waitress refuse to make it, but she proceed to call me a word that I cannot print in this paper".</p>
<p>Surly?</p>
<p>"I was forced to listen to the three classless bores who call themselves the owners get drunk and yell over each other all night".</p>
<p>Classless bores?</p>
<p>I am not a classless bore.</p>
<p>Well, I am not white trash.</p>
<p>I am a kind and a generous and a good-natured lady.</p>
<p>Well, I... I do seem to remember you calling a guy a faggot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I absolutely called him a faggot, but he ordered chardonnay.</p>
<p>What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p>"Having reviewed every bar in Philadelphia, I hereby officially declare Paddy's Pub to be the worst bar in Philly".</p>
<p>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia 4x08.</p>
<p>Hi. Are you Mr. Lyle Corman?</p>
<p>Yes, can I help you?</p>
<p>Good, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>We're here from Paddy's Pub, and we have come down to give you the opportunity to give us another chance.</p>
<p>Yeah, here's the thing. We felt that your first review was just a tiny bit off base.</p>
<p>Yeah, as you can see, we're not white trash.</p>
<p>Huh, really?</p>
<p>Well, uh, then, in that case, can you ask your friend to put down that hammer, please?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, don't let the hammer throw you, Corman.</p>
<p>We are classy, interesting people.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p>Well, don't be rude.</p>
<p>We just came to have a talk, so...</p>
<p>This is a private... I'm gonna have to get security.</p>
<p>Okay, we can play it that way, Corman.</p>
<p>But you should know that we would have no problem suing you.</p>
<p>Suing me?</p>
<p>What are you gonna sue me for?</p>
<p>Uh, libel, slander. There's two of the big dogs right there.</p>
<p>It's only libel if what I write is false.</p>
<p>You know what, buddy, we will jam your asshole up with so many lawyers, you won't know what to do with yourself.</p>
<p>I'll have you know, we have a team of lawyers on retainer just to deal with people like you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, check this out.</p>
<p>You're all out of time, bitch.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>You just got fazed.</p>
<p>This just in, Poo-Poo Pants.</p>
<p>People don't read newspapers anymore.</p>
<p>How's that for class?</p>
<p>Nice, brand-new Blu-Ray DVD player, all hooked up.</p>
<p>Hey, all right.</p>
<p>Where are we gonna put it?</p>
<p>We need like a flat surface.</p>
<p>Here we go. You know what, we'll just... we'll dangle it.</p>
<p>That looks better. We're not dangling anything. That's very white trash.</p>
<p>What is the point of having all this expensive new status symbol stuff if we're just gonna make it look terrible?</p>
<p>Hey, you guys want to see something?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I did something.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You kidnapped Corman?</p>
<p>I don't really know what happened, okay?</p>
<p>First, I was angry.</p>
<p>Then, I was drinking.</p>
<p>Next thing I know, I'm following this guy home and forcing him into the trunk of his own car.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, this is bad.</p>
<p>Really bad.</p>
<p>Don't panic. Don't panic.</p>
<p>Relax, I drove him around in a circle for a while, okay, so he wouldn't know where he was or how far away he'd gone.</p>
<p>But then you brought him back to a place where he's already been, and plus, he just heard everything you just said.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe we can just release him, and that way, this won't be a kidnapping.</p>
<p>First things first. Let's just get him out of the trunk; Let's get him into the bar; and then let's figure out what we need to do.</p>
<p>How are we gonna get him in the bar without anyone seeing him?</p>
<p>Easy, we roll him up in a rug.</p>
<p>Where are we gonna get a rug?</p>
<p>We buy a big Oriental rug, and we roll him up in it.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how expensive rugs are, Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah, especially Oriental rugs.</p>
<p>No, no rugs.</p>
<p>Just get him out of the car and into the bar, Charlie.</p>
<p>Help me get him out of the trunk.</p>
<p>Okay, so we're... we're really sorry about this, Mr. Corman.</p>
<p>Watch your head.</p>
<p>You're gonna be okay.</p>
<p>It's not a kidnapping, so...</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we're on the same page.</p>
<p>This is not a kidnapping.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, okay, all right.</p>
<p>But we do need to keep him here for a couple of hours so he doesn't do anything irrational.</p>
<p>Just borrowing him.</p>
<p>...go to the police.</p>
<p>That being said, let's take a few precautions here, okay?</p>
<p>We need to cover our tracks. Why don't we shoot over to Corman's place and make sure that Charlie left without a trace.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Charlie left with a trace.</p>
<p>He probably did.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Okay, and I'll use my cooling abilities to smooth things over with Corman, and then that...</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Are you still going on and on about being a cooler?</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>The cooler thing isn't helping now.</p>
<p>Just get into the bar, and make sure Charlie doesn't do anything stupid.</p>
<p>Okay, but can we establish that I'm the cooler?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Get into the bar.</p>
<p>We're surrounded by idiots.</p>
<p>Look, this really isn't necessary.</p>
<p>You don't have to tape me...</p>
<p>I'm sorry, man, but this is the situation we're in, and I just feel like this is the best thing to do here.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude, what are you doing?</p>
<p>You can't tape him up like that.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy gets my goat, man.</p>
<p>He sits around all day.</p>
<p>He judges people with his words and his fancy newspaper talk.</p>
<p>It's bullshit!</p>
<p>What is it that you people want?</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Fancy Pants Writer Man.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe you could write a new review, you know, and this time, maybe add a few less lies.</p>
<p>How can I write a new review if I am taped to a chair?</p>
<p>Come on, man. See, he's twisting everything I say around.</p>
<p>He's making me look like an asshole.</p>
<p>Okay, look, look. Nobody has to write anything against their will, okay?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I have to pee.</p>
<p>Okay, sidebar.</p>
<p>How is he gonna pee if his hands are taped down?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Let him piss in his pants.</p>
<p>No, he can't piss in his pants, Charlie!</p>
<p>I don't know why you're so in love with this guy.</p>
<p>I just don't want to get arrested for kidnapping.</p>
<p>If we just untie him for a second.</p>
<p>Not gonna work.</p>
<p>I used the last of the tape.</p>
<p>If you untie him, that tape's not gonna stick back up.</p>
<p>Go down to the basement.</p>
<p>See if there's any more tape.</p>
<p>I'll take him to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I'll defuse the situation.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I yelled at you, Mr. Corman.</p>
<p>I saw that!</p>
<p>I saw that! I saw that!</p>
<p>You're out of here, bro.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What, I'm packing to make it look like Corman went on a vacation.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you're all over the place.</p>
<p>You just put in a tropical shirt, and now two heavy coats?</p>
<p>I mean, is he going to Cancun or Canada?</p>
<p>You gotta pay attention to the details.</p>
<p>This is how people get caught.</p>
<p>Ah, shit, you're right.</p>
<p>I'm leaving a trace.</p>
<p>Okay... no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>He's probably under a lot of pressure with the deadlines from the newspaper.</p>
<p>He should relax.</p>
<p>Go someplace tropical?</p>
<p>Cancun then. Perfect.</p>
<p>Tropical.</p>
<p>You know what I'll do?</p>
<p>I will put an outgoing message on his answering machine.</p>
<p>That is good thinking, sis.</p>
<p>We're pretty good at this.</p>
<p>We are pretty damn good at this.</p>
<p>We're learning.</p>
<p><em>Greeting one.</p>
<p>Hi, this is Mehar.</p>
<p>Sorry I missed your call.</p>
<p>Please leave a message after the beep.</p>
<p>Peace.</em></p>
<p>That did not sound like Corman.</p>
<p>Who are you people?</p>
<p>Friends with Corman.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mr. Corman lives across the hall.</p>
<p>Oh, does he?</p>
<p>Does he?</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I really have to pee.</p>
<p>I hear ya, bro.</p>
<p>Now, back to the cooler conversation that we were having earlier.</p>
<p>I feel like in your article, you missed an opportunity to mention my bouncing abilities.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, it's really more about smarts than anything else.</p>
<p>For example, if there was an altercation in this bathroom, I would blast in looking to neutralize, yeah?</p>
<p>Now, I would check out my environment, and I would look to see if there's anything that I could use to my advantage.</p>
<p>Like this pool cue.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, normally, that wouldn't happen unless I wanted it to.</p>
<p>'Cause I could fire it right in your chest. 'Cause I got skills to do that.</p>
<p>Dude, there's like no tape anywhere.</p>
<p>All I could scrounge up was a bandana.</p>
<p>No, that's too small.</p>
<p>Oh, I could wear it though!</p>
<p>I should wear it.</p>
<p>I know, but I found it, so I sort of feel like...</p>
<p>No, I appreciate you looking for me and finding it for me.</p>
<p>No, hang on a second.</p>
<p>...that got me to the point of me getting the bandana.</p>
<p>Oh, you've got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>Just please get me out of this bathroom before I vomit.</p>
<p>It is absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p>Well, excuse me, Mr. Man.</p>
<p>But I happen to think this bathroom is pristine because I work very hard cleaning it.</p>
<p>In fact it's so clean I would say you could eat out of these urinals.</p>
<p>No, you absolutely could not eat out of these urinals.</p>
<p>Oh, really? What's this?</p>
<p>Charlie, don't.</p>
<p>Char... Oh, my God, dude!</p>
<p>Bro, I really...</p>
<p>I just pissed in there, like five minutes before you came in.</p>
<p>Don't say that.</p>
<p>Now you're gonna make me look bad.</p>
<p>Spit it out, man. You're gonna eat it?</p>
<p>You're still chewing it.</p>
<p>I have to prove a point!</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Just let me go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I will write the review.</p>
<p>I'll do whatever you want.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>Well, now that wasn't so hard, was it?</p>
<p>Great. Awesome.</p>
<p>Well, I think that we're... we're in good shape then.</p>
<p>How are we gonna do this?</p>
<p>Well, I think one of us is gonna have to help his...</p>
<p>Whoa, dude!</p>
<p>I'm not touching his dick.</p>
<p>Well, Charlie, you're the one that used all the tape.</p>
<p>Well, I was comfortable with letting him piss in his pants.</p>
<p>Well, all right, fine.</p>
<p>Then compromise.</p>
<p>We'll both do it. That way it's equally weird for both of us.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Fine. Just-just untape me.</p>
<p>Please. No. Oh, no.</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Can I bring something up?</p>
<p>Did he get a little bit hard on us?</p>
<p>Can we not talk about this?</p>
<p>I just felt like you got a little bit...</p>
<p>It was very weird.</p>
<p>Well, why did it move?!</p>
<p>Hey, guys!</p>
<p>We got a problem.</p>
<p>We did something.</p>
<p>Oh, man!</p>
<p>Oh, man! What happened, dude?</p>
<p>Well, there was this a slight mix-up with the apartments.</p>
<p>This is Corman's neighbor Mehar.</p>
<p>What happened to doing this without a trace?</p>
<p>Well, it-it's a long story, but the punch line is that he starting asking questions...</p>
<p>I asked one question.</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>No, you asked a lot of questions.</p>
<p>All right, well, let's not have him ask more questions.</p>
<p>Let's just keep him in the trunk for now.</p>
<p>You can't kidnap more people to cover up the original kidnapping.</p>
<p>It's a classic mistake.</p>
<p>I'm sorry...</p>
<p>I didn't know there was a handbook on kidnapping.</p>
<p><em>Help!</p>
<p>We gotta get him inside.</em></p>
<p>It's probably very hot in there.</p>
<p>There's another bit of an issue, which is that I locked the keys in the trunk just now.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Well, I didn't want to bring that up.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie!</p>
<p>This is what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>You guys deal with the situation out here.</p>
<p>Let's go talk to Corman.</p>
<p>He's writing that new review.</p>
<p>Okay, 'cause I don't want to see that man right now.</p>
<p>We don't really want...</p>
<p>Because we had a whole thing.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Something happened.</p>
<p>None of your business.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>We had a thing amongst the...</p>
<p>Let's just go inside.</p>
<p>Can you just... please.</p>
<p>How long do you think we can hold that inside?</p>
<p>It's burning me up inside.</p>
<p>It's burning me up.</p>
<p>There he is. Our little typer.</p>
<p>Type, type, typing away.</p>
<p>Don't mean to disturb ya.</p>
<p>Oh, you're not disturbing me at all.</p>
<p>It's great to see you two again.</p>
<p>I get it. I get it.</p>
<p>You are too much, huh?</p>
<p>You're being a smart-aleck.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Glad your spirits are still up.</p>
<p>Listen, we wanted to come in and just let you know we're sorry about this whole tie-up-and-hold-you-here thing.</p>
<p>We didn't have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>No, that wasn't us.</p>
<p>That was somebody else's idea.</p>
<p>Not our idea.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>Now if there's anything though that we can do, since we are in this situation...</p>
<p>Absolutely, together we are.</p>
<p>...you want to let us know.</p>
<p>Anything at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, how about, uh, letting me go.</p>
<p>There he goes again.</p>
<p>I didn't know he was so funny.</p>
<p>I didn't know he was gonna...</p>
<p>...ask for food or something.</p>
<p>Is there something else we can get you though?</p>
<p>'Cause clearly, you know, we can't...</p>
<p>All right, a glass of white wine, maybe a chardonnay.</p>
<p>Now you're talking.</p>
<p>You like white wine. I know that.</p>
<p>Um, also, do you want me to bring you some lipstick with that?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>You got fazed again, Corman.</p>
<p>You can't just tee her up and expect her not to take a swing at you, right?</p>
<p>Can't blame her for that one.</p>
<p>Can't blame her for that one.</p>
<p>Hey, since you are writing a new review, uh, is there anything I can do to help you out with it?</p>
<p>Uh, you want to fire a couple questions my way?</p>
<p>No, I think I'm fine.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, hey, no problem, man.</p>
<p>I just want to... just want to make sure you got the total picture on me 'cause I do drive a Range Rover.</p>
<p>Gas guzzler.</p>
<p>Well, not on the highway. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's very classy vehicle, though.</p>
<p>What do you want me to say?</p>
<p>What do I want you to say?</p>
<p>I don't know, "Dennis Reynolds, your car is awesome.</p>
<p>Your flat screen TV...</p>
<p>I took a look at it.</p>
<p>It's very, very thin. It speaks volumes about you as a person".</p>
<p>I don't know; give me something I can work with, Corman.</p>
<p>All right, Dennis.</p>
<p>Here's the deal. I didn't feel like opening up a bottle of wine so I brought you some scotch 'cause I feel like that's what writers should drink.</p>
<p>Hey, some top-shelf scotch.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't drink scotch.</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to be a dick about it.</p>
<p>Got a real chip on her shoulder, this one.</p>
<p>If I had to write an article about you, it would say that you're very negative.</p>
<p>The headline might be: "Most negative man in the world calls other people white trash to make himself not feel so faggy".</p>
<p>Faggy?</p>
<p>You mind if I just took a quick peek at your new review there?</p>
<p>Uh, but I haven't...</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>I know you're not finished.</p>
<p>I just want to see what direction we're headed in there, buddy.</p>
<p>What's it say?</p>
<p>It's, uh, pretty heavy on the kidnapping aspect.</p>
<p>It is?</p>
<p>You jam in further though.</p>
<p>This is... Unlock the bottom.</p>
<p>I'm going for whatever's down there and, um, it won't catch on to anything is the problem, man.</p>
<p>Damn it, dude.</p>
<p>I feel like this should be easier!</p>
<p>People break into cars all the time.</p>
<p>You know, a piece of me wants to chalk this whole guy-in-the-trunk thing up to a loss right now, dude.</p>
<p>We can't do that, bro.</p>
<p>We gotta get him out of the car.</p>
<p>Well, then why don't you just let me take the hammer and smash the window and we'll just pop the trunk.</p>
<p>Charlie, if we're gonna smash the window, I would simply do it with a roundhouse kick.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, you're not gonna be able to break this window with a roundhouse kick.</p>
<p>Let's get serious here.</p>
<p>Charlie, I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life.</p>
<p><em>Help!</p>
<p>Please let me out. I have to get home. I have a cat.</em></p>
<p>Sir, we all have cats that we'd like to be playing with right now, okay?</p>
<p>We're doing our very best.</p>
<p><em>My cat is diabetic. She needs her insulin shot. Please!</em></p>
<p>So we got to babysit a cat now?</p>
<p>I can't have a dead cat's blood on my hands, man.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>All right, Mac to the rescue.</p>
<p>Let me just back up.</p>
<p>I'm gonna roundhouse this. I'm gonna kick it, and then we can get it.</p>
<p>Kick it, man.</p>
<p>All right, but back up, 'cause I don't want the glass to shatter at your face.</p>
<p>All right, go.</p>
<p>Guard your eyes.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>shit, dude! shit!</p>
<p>There is a slope in the ground, and I didn't...</p>
<p>I wasn't, I wasn't calibrating that great.</p>
<p>You just totally broke this mirror, bro.</p>
<p>Well, it's the bullshit street.</p>
<p>We gotta get that zoning people out here.</p>
<p>I don't think it's the street, bro.</p>
<p>Don't touch the window, all right?</p>
<p>I'll do that when I get back.</p>
<p>I gonna grab his cat with Dennis' car. I'll be back.</p>
<p>Learn how to kick.</p>
<p>Take one karate class if you're so into karate, you know?</p>
<p>That is a really, really nice setup.</p>
<p>Now, if he doesn't go for that, he's just a straight-up retard.</p>
<p>I mean, that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, pal. Oh, check out this new setup, man.</p>
<p>This is going to be our golden ticket, man.</p>
<p>This is really going to get us somewhere.</p>
<p>Hey, man, do you see any hypodermic needles laying around?</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Mehar's cat. Diabetic.</p>
<p>Now a diabetic cat is in play?</p>
<p>Jesus, we can't catch a break.</p>
<p>I know, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Nice and easy now.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Charlie!</p>
<p>You broke the window?</p>
<p>Dude, the guy had to take a dump.</p>
<p>What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Wait, he's all tied up.</p>
<p>How did you...?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about how it happened, okay? It just happened.</p>
<p>Give him his cat.</p>
<p>Dude, your cat's freaking out!</p>
<p>That's not my cat.</p>
<p>No, Dee.</p>
<p>What the hell you doin', Dee?</p>
<p>What's Mehar doing here?</p>
<p>What are you doing with my cat?!</p>
<p>Your cat?!</p>
<p>Yes! What is going on?</p>
<p>Mr. Corman, why are they doing this?</p>
<p>No, no, no. Get out of here!</p>
<p>Give him his cat and get him back in the office.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, oh, this is bad.</p>
<p>This is bad, man.</p>
<p>This is really bad.</p>
<p>You guys, this is bad.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>We gotta come up with a plan fast!</p>
<p>Go it! Ready?</p>
<p>Here's the plan.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this.</p>
<p>Okay, we give them amnesia.</p>
<p>It's so easy, here how you do it.</p>
<p>You smash them both over the head with a bottle.</p>
<p>They go down like a ton of bricks, okay?</p>
<p>Then we drag them back to their apartments, we put them in their beds, you know?</p>
<p>We set their clocks back.</p>
<p>We get yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>We put it on their front doorstep.</p>
<p>They wake up thinking it was all a dream.</p>
<p>That's so goddamn stupid!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>It's so stupid. Mac, please tell me you got something.</p>
<p>I say... we bribe them.</p>
<p>A bribe.</p>
<p>We bribe them.</p>
<p>A good, old-fashioned bribe.</p>
<p>No, that's not gonna work, you know why?</p>
<p>Corman's not gonna go for that.</p>
<p>He's, like, made of stone or something.</p>
<p>Oh, Mehar!</p>
<p>Let's bribe Mehar.</p>
<p>He'd go for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mehar could work.</p>
<p>But I did notice that the kidnapping has rubbed him the wrong way.</p>
<p>So whatever we bribe him with, it's got to be worth a lot of money.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's gonna want something good for sure. For sure.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, no.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks a lot for taking home Corman's cat.</p>
<p>And good luck with your sick cat.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, this is bullshit.</p>
<p>All right, let's go talk to Corman.</p>
<p>Hold on there, Corman.</p>
<p>Where are you going, buddy?</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>You're not going very fast.</p>
<p>You're just wasting a lot of energy. Stop.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. Listen, man, we got a proposal for you, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, now we are willing to not force you to write that review if you are willing to step up, do the right thing and not tell anybody that this happened.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Whatever it takes to get me out of this bar away from you people.</p>
<p>My man.</p>
<p>That is the attitude we were waiting for the whole time.</p>
<p>That's right, man.</p>
<p>Where's this guy been?</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the pressing charges.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're gonna need you to sign something.</p>
<p>Fine. Whatever it takes.</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys are gonna try and cut a deal with this weasel.</p>
<p>The guy's a liar!</p>
<p>He lied to us, man. He said he was going to write a review, he didn't do that.</p>
<p>I touch his dick.</p>
<p>Mac, we touched his dick.</p>
<p>Now is not the time to talk about that.</p>
<p>Why were you guys touching his dick?</p>
<p>There wasn't enough tape and...</p>
<p>So you touched his dick?!</p>
<p>Move past it. Let's plow through it.</p>
<p>Okay, Mr. Corman, why don't you just go ahead and sign this.</p>
<p>And then I'll fill in the blanks later.</p>
<p>Then that way, we'll have a confession, it'll be great.</p>
<p>And there you go.</p>
<p>Okay, now, let me just get this tape off you, and you could be on your way.</p>
<p>Now, we won't charge you for the duct tape.</p>
<p>That was a joke.</p>
<p>shit, bro!</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?!</p>
<p>I really don't like this guy.</p>
<p>You're an idiot!</p>
<p>Well, we'll see who's the idiot when he wakes up tomorrow and doesn't remember a thing.</p>
<p>I don't think that's how it works, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's definitely not how it works, man.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>We may as well embrace the amnesia angle, because we have no other options at this point.</p>
<p>Well, now!</p>
<p>Okay, I'll go get yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys ready?</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p><em>And I'll take...</p>
<p>With me the memories To be my sunshine After the rain It's so hard To say good-bye To yesterday...</em></p>
<p>I ran out.</p>
<p>I ran out of breath.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>What you got there, Ernie?</p>
<p>Oh, it's a new review by Corman.</p>
<p>"I woke up in my neighbor's bed with a head wound," yesterday's paper, and an empty bottle of sleeping pills, and my nightmare in that putrid, shithole of a bar, Paddy's Pub, finally, mercifully came to an end.</p>
<p>The owners all deserve to rot in jail, though having to spend every day with each other in that violent establishment is a decidedly great punishment.</p>
<p>That is why I decided to not press charges leaving 'em to live in the hell on earth that they've created for themselves for the rest of their pathetic and miserable lives.</p>
<p>Really cold what he's been writing.</p>
<p>It's wrotten there.</p>
<p>Not a good review.</p>
<p>No, it's not a good review.</p>
<p>Right for the throw.</p>
<p>At least, he didn't mention our names.</p>
<p>No charges, no names.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I'm a little irritated that he didn't mention our names.</p>
<p>I feel like he'd to mentien our names.</p>
<p>I increadibly annoid that he didn't mention our names.</p>
<p>I whish I can live with this but I can't.</p>
<p>It's a history about us!</p>
<p>I feel like we go talk to him, again.</p>
<p>We should talk to him.</p>
<p>We're capable of being civils, right?</p>
<p>Let's just, you know...</p>
<p>Communication is the key, it make sens.</p>
<p>Uh, my hammer again.</p>
