<p>Okay, it's 2:30 on a Wednesday, Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>Hello, America.</p>
<p>Mac here with another installment of Project Bad ass.</p>
<p>As you can see, the ramp is about 40 feet down there.</p>
<p>I will now light the pyrotechnics... which are attached at the arms and back and all over my pants.</p>
<p>'Cause I know what it means Totally and completely badass.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Three, two, one...</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>You see what I was going for, right?</p>
<p>How badass is that?</p>
<p>You know what, man?</p>
<p>I actually found that to be pretty goddamn entertaing.</p>
<p>Yeah, dude.</p>
<p>I got to be honest with you.</p>
<p>Now you have some more of those?</p>
<p>Oh, man, I got a shitload of those.</p>
<p>Yeah. I've been working my ass off on these videos.</p>
<p>Now has Charlie seen these?</p>
<p>I bet he would love 'em.</p>
<p>Yeah, I showed it to him.</p>
<p>He acted like he liked it... in fact he even asked me to keep one of the videocassettes for multiple views... and then when I wasn't around, I saw him smashing one.</p>
<p>Smashing it?</p>
<p>Dude, I don't know what his problem is, but he's been completely pissing me off recently.</p>
<p>I worked so hard on those tapes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To show how badass I am.</p>
<p>Code Red! Code Red, guys!</p>
<p>Guys, we got a Code Red on our hands!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, check it out.</p>
<p>Now according to my sources in the field, the waitress is seeing somebody.</p>
<p>Do you know who this guy is?</p>
<p>No. I have no idea, man.</p>
<p>I just got a shady read-out of the guy.</p>
<p>I tell you what, Mac, seeing as how you're my best friend... maybe you can look into it for me.</p>
<p>You know, go down there, snoop around the shop.</p>
<p>Can I stop you for a second?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here.</p>
<p>You just said that he was your best friend.</p>
<p>How is he your best friend over me?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you banged the waitress.</p>
<p>Do I even have to explain that to you?</p>
<p>That kind of rubbed me the wrong way, dude.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I don't see how that should factor in to whether we're best friends or not.</p>
<p>You know, to be honest with you, man, I'm a little shocked.</p>
<p>I'm kind of... I'm thunder struck.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, man, but you know, I didn't mean to hurt you, I didn't mean to thunder strike you, but that's I don't know what else to tell you. What do you want to hear?</p>
<p>I need for you to explain to me how it is that you consider.</p>
<p>Mac to be a better friend to you.</p>
<p>This is just becoming awkward.</p>
<p>When I have a real problem, and all of a sudden, it's about some weird feelings thing.</p>
<p>And it's not about your feelings right now, it's about my feelings 'cause I have a problem, okay?</p>
<p>Now, Mac, please, do you think you can find this guy and kick his ass for me?</p>
<p>Absolutely, bro. I will find this guy and I will kick his ass.</p>
<p>And you know why?</p>
<p>Because you and I are best friends.</p>
<p>He's on to us.</p>
<p>Its always sunny in philly 404.</p>
<p>Hey, what's up, buddy?</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good. So look, I'm only going to be here like a night or two, until Mac and I take care of a little business.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, man, you stay as long as you want to, man, 'cause that's what, you know, that's what friends do: They let each other stay at each other's apartments, and they hang out with each other, and...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And we can do that, do some bonding, go over the best friend thing a couple more times.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro?</p>
<p>Where are you going with that?</p>
<p>I was just going to throw your sleeping bag in my room.</p>
<p>'Cause you can stay with me.</p>
<p>Yeah... I was going to stay in Mac's room.</p>
<p>I'm sure he wouldn't mind.</p>
<p>Hey, my room's a lot bigger.</p>
<p>I was going to stick with the plan here, so...</p>
<p>Okay, listen, man, since you're here and you've got all this beer, let's crack a couple of them open. Let's get tipsy.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the beer is for me and Mac, you know, to...</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be though.</p>
<p>To celebrate the ass-kicking.</p>
<p>Well, I mean there's... 24 beers there, if I'm counting right.</p>
<p>12 for me and 12 for Mac.</p>
<p>12 for Mac...</p>
<p>That's sort of our thing that we do.</p>
<p>You guys are really going to drink that many, just the two of you tonight?</p>
<p>We could do something else.</p>
<p>Let's do something else.</p>
<p>Hey, board games, man.</p>
<p>Let's have a board game night.</p>
<p>Chinese checkers, I got...</p>
<p>That's kind of foreign, so...</p>
<p>I got...</p>
<p>I got Clue, you know, we could solve a mystery together.</p>
<p>We could...</p>
<p>Complicated stuff there.</p>
<p>What about Connect Four?</p>
<p>Connect Four's a fun game.</p>
<p>I don't like counting.</p>
<p>It's not that much counting.</p>
<p>It's just one, two, three, and then four, you win.</p>
<p>But a lot... a lot of times, you got to count that much.</p>
<p>Not that many times. If you get it once, you've won the game.</p>
<p>So... you're...</p>
<p>Have you ever spent any...</p>
<p>Kind of in...</p>
<p>I'm in your way.</p>
<p>... In my way.</p>
<p>I'm in your way.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Hey, let's watch a movie.</p>
<p>That's simple. That doesn't require any...</p>
<p>We could just sit down and, like, watch... I bought...</p>
<p>I bought a bunch of new DVDs.</p>
<p>Yeah... I got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>What are you...? What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, nothing. Just got a couple long-range walkie-talkies.</p>
<p>Oh, cool. Did you get one for me?</p>
<p>I did... not.</p>
<p>Oh, that's all right. I mean we could probably just...</p>
<p>Who has, who has the other one?</p>
<p>Mac probably.</p>
<p>All right, let's do this.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Popping my pants off.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we're gonna bang.</p>
<p>To shove it into Charlie's face for smashing my tape.</p>
<p>How many times do we have to go through this?</p>
<p>Dude, look, I know what your little plan is, but if I'm going to bang you, it's going to be on my own terms, okay?</p>
<p>There's some things that I need from you.</p>
<p>All right, whatever.</p>
<p>I'll wear the goddamn condom, but I'm not psyched about it.</p>
<p>This isn't about condom.</p>
<p>What...? Do you really not wear condom when you have sex with strangers?</p>
<p>Why would I wear a condom...?</p>
<p>Okay, I don't care. I don't care.</p>
<p>You know what, I just need you to get me in Dennis' house alone so I can get something back from him.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>None of your business.</p>
<p>Is it a sex tape?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes. How do you know that?</p>
<p>Yeah, because he videotapes every chick he bangs.</p>
<p>He's got like a thousand of them. I don't like 'em though.</p>
<p>It's mostly that horrible angle that you see in porns, you know, where it's all balls and male ass just...</p>
<p>That is disgusting.</p>
<p>Who likes that? Who finds that sexy?</p>
<p>That is disgusting.</p>
<p>I don't know anybody...</p>
<p>Are there balls and asshole men...</p>
<p>Okay, please stop. Please stop doing that.</p>
<p>Friend one, best friend two, come in. Over.</p>
<p>I'm gonna take this, and then, maybe a little bit later we could do some hand stuff.</p>
<p>Are you in junior high?</p>
<p>Mouth stuff?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Mouth stuff.</p>
<p>I'll talk to you in a minute.</p>
<p>Best friend one to best friend two.</p>
<p>Okay, what's the status there, best friend two?</p>
<p>You make contact with the target?</p>
<p>Yeah, affirmative. I totally kicked his ass.</p>
<p>Good man!</p>
<p>Hey, what was this jerk's name?</p>
<p>His name...</p>
<p>Don.</p>
<p>Don. Typical.</p>
<p>Did you get a last name on this chump?</p>
<p>Yeah, Johnson.</p>
<p>Yeah, sounds like a real sucker.</p>
<p>Actually, no. He had some pretty sweet moves, but I totally... round housed him.</p>
<p>Took him out. My form is pretty perfect, so.</p>
<p>Sure you did. I'm sure you did. All right, that's my man.</p>
<p>That's my best friend right there.</p>
<p>Hey, why don't you head back to the nest for some pizza and beer, best friend one, over and out.</p>
<p>He forgot to say "over and out." I can't believe that.</p>
<p>He's lying.</p>
<p>He's spinning you a web of lies, Charlie.</p>
<p>What are you talking about, dude?</p>
<p>"Don Johnson."</p>
<p>You don't find that a little suspicious?</p>
<p>No. Should I?</p>
<p>Don Johnson's the dude from Miami Vice, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's plenty of Don Johnsons running around Philly, dude.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Then maybe he beat up the, Don Johnson you're talking about.</p>
<p>No, no. It's something else.</p>
<p>Something stinks here, bro, and it is not just Mac's dirty socks.</p>
<p>They do stink, don't they?</p>
<p>They smell really bad.</p>
<p>Really bad.</p>
<p>I'm surprised you've been able to be in here for this long without cracking a window or something.</p>
<p>It has not been easy.</p>
<p>I should crack a window.</p>
<p>You really should.</p>
<p>I tried. It's like they're sealed shut or something.</p>
<p>I hate to say this, bro, but...</p>
<p>I think Mac's banging the waitress.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Now, I can't say for sure.</p>
<p>I don't have any hard evidence, but that's just what it feels like from where I'm standing, man and he's gonna break your heart, man.</p>
<p>And when he breaks your heart, I'll be here to pick up the pieces and put you back together 'cause that's what a real best friend does.</p>
<p>You know where to find me.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude.</p>
<p>You scared the shit outta me.</p>
<p>It's a little late, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. What are, what are you still doing up?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know...</p>
<p>I was just waiting for my... my best friend.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well... I went on a long walk, so...</p>
<p>Hey, here's an idea for you.</p>
<p>How 'bout you take your mind off of it with some pizza?</p>
<p>And some beer.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I hate all the pizza.</p>
<p>And I had to drink all the beer.</p>
<p>You must be wasted, dude.</p>
<p>24 beers by yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm very wasted.</p>
<p>Right. Okay. Why don't you come to bed, bro.</p>
<p>Ohh, I don't think I'll be sleeping inyourbed tonight.</p>
<p>Doesn't really feel right.</p>
<p>I feel like it might be a little bit better for me... if I spent the night on the couch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That's cool. Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again.</p>
<p>Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we?</p>
<p>No! We wouldn't.</p>
<p>'Cause that would be... a terrible thing to do... to your best friend.</p>
<p>Seriously, bro, if you piss on the couch again, you're gonna buy us a...</p>
<p>I'm not gonna piss on the couch, not gonna happen.</p>
<p>I just wanta be very clear: You're buying us a new couch.</p>
<p>I'm in control of myself.</p>
<p>Don't piss on the couch.</p>
<p>You've done it before.</p>
<p>All right, good night.</p>
<p>Hang in, Joe. Myself.</p>
<p>Didn't sound like best friend talk out here to me.</p>
<p>It really wasn't.</p>
<p>You want to come in my room?</p>
<p>I guess I was just fine.</p>
<p>Come on, Charlie.</p>
<p>Come to your real best friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're my friend.</p>
<p>I'm your friend.</p>
<p>Oh, God, your breath is horrible.</p>
<p>Sorry. I'm like so drunk.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>Just get in the bed.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Dennis, wake up.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>It's really late, dude.</p>
<p>There's a certain situation developing between myself, Charlie and the waitress that I need to talk to you about.</p>
<p>Proceed.</p>
<p>Okay, well, as you know, Charlie thinks that he and I are best friends, which is total bullshit because you know that what we have is much stronger than that.</p>
<p>You and I are blood brothers.</p>
<p>Oh, most definitely.</p>
<p>Okay, so, as my blood brother, I need to confide a secret to you.</p>
<p>You've been banging the waitress?</p>
<p>How'd you know that?</p>
<p>You're my blood brother, man.</p>
<p>I know more about you than you know about yourself.</p>
<p>All right, listen, bro. I need you to do me a favor.</p>
<p>Can you get Charlie out of the apartment tomorrow?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>'Cause she wants to bang in your bed.</p>
<p>I don't know. She's obsessed with you or something. She's a total freak.</p>
<p>But I don't really give a shit either way because I just want to rub it in Charlie's face for smashing my Project Bad ass tape.</p>
<p>Whatever it's gonna take to finally get you two banging.</p>
<p>Yeah, hey, Dennis, I got you something.</p>
<p>You got me something? What?</p>
<p>I got you a walkie-talkie. - Dude...</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>That way we can communicate better.</p>
<p>We'll just use a different channel than Charlie and I use.</p>
<p>That's awesome, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's great, right?</p>
<p>Actually, yeah.</p>
<p>Let me talk to you.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>What am I seeing?</p>
<p>Nothing, man. You're having a dream right now.</p>
<p>Yeah. Just a dream.</p>
<p>I'm dreaming?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're dreaming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You sure? 'Cause I feel like I'm awake.</p>
<p>No, man. You're... this is a dream that you're having.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Am I peeing?</p>
<p>Are you peeing?</p>
<p>It's all over the bed.</p>
<p>It's piss. He's peeing.</p>
<p>I told him he was gonna do it, I knew he was gonna do it.</p>
<p>He drank too much.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, if I'm peeing... You're wake me up.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro, but that had to change your mind about who your real best friend is, though, huh?</p>
<p>I'll give you this much, dude: The guy's acting very weird, okay?</p>
<p>But I need proof if I'm gonna sell him down the river.</p>
<p>Proof? He told me he was gonna bang her, man.</p>
<p>Maybe the two of you are plotting against me.</p>
<p>Look, it doesn't matter. I got a plan to prove it to you anyway.</p>
<p>All right, what's this plan of yours?</p>
<p>Walk with me a second.</p>
<p>So, what I did is I planted that walkie-talkie that Mac gave me in my bedroom.</p>
<p>We're gonna switch your walkie to that channel and we're gonna listen to the whole thing. We're gonna catch that son of a bitch red-handed.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that'll work.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's gonna work, and the whole thing's gonna be on tape, too.</p>
<p>So you know that video camera I keep in my bedroom?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I got that bad boy running 24/7.</p>
<p>It's like a security cam except it's for banging.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Come into the office with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, he keeps that camera on nonstop, just in case.</p>
<p>Yeah! Here we go.</p>
<p>"W" through "Z." You should be under "W," yeah?</p>
<p>No, my name doesn't start with a "W."</p>
<p>"Waitress." Here we go.</p>
<p>"Waitress." One star. Not good.</p>
<p>Oh, just give that to me. One star.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I guess a deal's a deal, so pop those knickers off so we can jam, yeah?</p>
<p>Not just yet.</p>
<p>I need one more thing from you.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I just want to bang at this point, just to get over with.</p>
<p>Oh, I just want to get it over with, too, but I want you to bang me at Charlie and Frank's apartment.</p>
<p>You want to bang in Charlie and Frank's apartment?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'll be good. Yeah, we can rub his face in it.</p>
<p>Okay, if we're gonna do that, we got to be very careful, 'cause I don't want to get caught slipping in and out before the coitus.</p>
<p>Let's make a plan.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, this doesn't make any sense, we should be hearing them by now.</p>
<p>We aren't we hearing them?</p>
<p>'Cause I turned it off.</p>
<p>What do you mean, you turned it off?</p>
<p>I don't want to listen to this, man! you got to listen to it.</p>
<p>I don't think I can.</p>
<p>You need to hear him sexing her, okay?</p>
<p>Because the video alone won't be evidence enough because of the angle.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the angle?</p>
<p>Let's put it this way, you won't be able to see anybody's face, you know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>Oh, it's the low down...</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>If we're gonna do this, the only way it's gonna work is if you're dressed like a man.</p>
<p>Dressed like a man?</p>
<p>You want me to dress like a man?</p>
<p>Yeah. The only way it's really gonna work for me is if you're dressed like Dennis or Charlie.</p>
<p>I should probably dress like Charlie, 'cause he's kind of my height.</p>
<p>No. No, I'm gonna be Charlie, you're gonna be Dennis.</p>
<p>That's gonna be much better for me, trust me.</p>
<p>We'll dress you up in his clothes, and, then, that way we can slip you in and out with ease.</p>
<p>'Cause we got to be very careful, this could be a very very messy situation.</p>
<p>'Kay, so I want you to stay behind me.</p>
<p>Get behind me and stay behind me, the whole time.</p>
<p>I think I want to be in front of you.</p>
<p>No, no. You got to be behind me. I got to have you behind me.</p>
<p>What the hell is that all about, man?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Now, from here on out, I'm gonna refer to you only as Dennis.</p>
<p>When we slip in, you're gonna start banging me, hard!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Well... Mac's gay.</p>

<p>Blood Brother One to Blood Brother Two.</p>
<p>Are you there, Blood Brother Two?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Blood Brother Two... go ahead.</p>
<p>My mission's extremely close to being complete. But I need a favor.</p>
<p>I need you to get Frank and Charlie away from their apartment, okay?</p>
<p>I need to get in there without being detected.</p>
<p>Blood Brother One, over and out!</p>
<p>Now he says "over and out." I can't believe he just said "over and out."</p>
<p>What do you think he wants over at your apartment?</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on with him, man.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, dude, I know what it is.</p>
<p>This is sick, but hear me out.</p>
<p>I think he wants to be you getting banged by me in your apartment.</p>
<p>It's like role-play!</p>
<p>Oh, God, he's got some sick, twisted obsession with us, man, and, like...</p>
<p>He's totally obsessed with us.</p>
<p>That's why he's showing us all those videos and trying to prove to us that he's a badass.</p>
<p>He wants to impress us because he's in love with us.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, he's soin love with us.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Dude!</p>
<p>This is twisted.</p>
<p>This is dark.</p>
<p>We definitely need to get to about this.</p>
<p>Look, let's just find a hiding spot, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>I'm thinking if I get in the bed and I get real low and flat, and maybe you're underneath me or on top of me, you know, they won't see us.</p>
<p>Well, how does that work?</p>
<p>Okay, well, see, here's the problem.</p>
<p>If I get all balled up and small, I get too high, and you'll see that there's someone in the bed.</p>
<p>Now, the further and wider I go, the flatter I become, like a starfish, you know?</p>
<p>What in the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>Why would we want to look like a starfish?</p>
<p>It's just the best hiding spot. There aren't a lot of good hiding spots here, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need to find another one, 'cause we're not hiding in the bed.</p>
<p>These things are covered in piss.</p>
<p>All right, come on.</p>
<p>Come on! Stay behind me.</p>
<p>Why are these jeans so tight?</p>
<p>Because Dennis takes them all in at the thighs to accentuate his female form.</p>
<p>I would never say it to his face, but Dennis has great thighs.</p>
<p>All right, now, let's stop talking and start banging.</p>
<p>We busted you!</p>
<p>Caught!</p>
<p>You are busted!</p>
<p>We're busted?</p>
<p>Because you look pretty busted.</p>
<p>No, this is the best way to hide in my apartment.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie, I knew we shouldn't have done this in the bed!</p>
<p>Why did you have to get on top of me?!</p>
<p>That's the only way to hide and have it not be noticeable in my apartment!</p>
<p>There's nowhere to hide in here!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Coming in here, talking about how in love with my thighs you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, or is it my creamy thighs you're after?</p>
<p>I see you've taken to wearing my clothes, you sick freak.</p>
<p>Come on, you heard him talking about my thighs when he came in.</p>
<p>It was my thighs, dude, it's always been my thighs.</p>
<p>Were you guys humping?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, where is the tape?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The sex tape that Frank made, where is it?</p>
<p>Frank made a sex tape, too?</p>
<p>Yes, apparently, he made a tape of us having sex when I banged him to get back at Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, here's what happened, guys.</p>
<p>I thought it was one of Mac's Project Badasstapes, so I pop it in the VCR to watch it, I see what it is, I become violently ill, okay?</p>
<p>Then I start smashing. And I smash good.</p>
<p>So that's what you were smashing.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, bro, I thought you were smashing my Project Bad ass tape because you hated it.</p>
<p>What, dude? I love Project Bad ass.</p>
<p>I watch those tapes all the time.</p>
<p>Okay, so the sex tape is gone, then?</p>
<p>Yeah. I smashed the crap out of it. Gone.</p>
<p>Great. Good. Thank you, Charlie. Thanks.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Kind of don't know what else to say.</p>
<p>Say, I will have dinner with you and thank you for this, and thank you.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Just say the words...</p>
<p>No, I will never go out with you. Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I will say them for you.</p>
<p>You should be more grateful!</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I was gonna bang the witch just to get back at you, because I thought you smashed my tape, and I'm glad I didn't now, right?</p>
<p>'Cause that chick is the worst. man, she's terrible, gross.</p>
<p>Only got one star from me.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>You're watching my tapes again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What'd you think?</p>
<p>You got weird balls.</p>
<p>You should see Frank's balls.</p>
<p>They're like planets.</p>
<p>You know what this all makes me realize, though?</p>
<p>Is that maybe the three of us were meant to be best friends... together.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would 'cause a lot less problems if we just called it even, said we're all best buds and no more turning on each other.</p>
<p>You can have more than one best friend, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Three best friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Three Amigos, huh?</p>
<p>All right! The three...</p>
<p>Musketeers!</p>
<p>Blind mice!</p>
<p>The three...</p>
<p>Stooges.</p>
<p>I don't want to be associated with those...</p>
<p>I wanna get one.</p>
<p>There's another one out there.</p>
<p>Move past it.</p>
<p>I can't get it. All right.</p>
<p>Let's move past it, let's put it behind us, guys.</p>
<p>Let's put it behind us, and let's concentrate on what's really important.</p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to Project Badassvolume XVI.</p>
<p>As you can see, the mattresses are stacked three high, creating a safe but still amazingly badass landing zone.</p>
<p>I will now light the fuse that is attached to the pyrotechnics all over my jacket and pants.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
<p>One, two, three... bad ass.</p>
<p>Hey, man, do you still get the feeling he wants to bang us?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>That's what this is all about, huh?</p>
<p>I think so, I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
