<p>Would you describe these pieces more savory or succulent.</p>
<p>It's definitely way too over cooked to be succulent, but it's still pretty delicious.</p>
<p>It's still savory, right?</p>
<p>Now, what if we insert it in beer?</p>
<p>Do you think that would help like regain it's succulence.</p>
<p>Like a beer-rub.</p>
<p>Hu-hum.</p>
<p>That's actually really smart.</p>
<p>Mac, grab us some beers.</p>
<p>Bite my bird.</p>
<p>What are you eating?</p>
<p>Oh, dude, Dee and I cooked up a great steak.</p>
<p>Frank's got, like, this whole fridge full of these delicious meats that I've been stealing.</p>
<p>You guys wanna try some of this?</p>
<p>Someone who sweats as much as you should not work with food.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>I told you stay away from my meat!</p>
<p>Spit it out.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Spit it! Spit it out!</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>You too. Spit!</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Right there.</p>
<p>Why you're being such a selfish jerk?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>I killed the dear, I should get to eat it.</p>
<p>That's the natural order.</p>
<p>Wait, you shot a dear?</p>
<p>That's right. 10 point buck.</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<p>Right between the sorrowful little eyes.</p>
<p>Since when do you, bro?</p>
<p>Since always.</p>
<p>I'm a great hunter.</p>
<p>How does hunting a defenseless creature make you a good hunter?</p>
<p>Yeah, you should go after something that could at least defend itself.</p>
<p>You know, a really great hunter would go after something that can hunt him back.</p>
<p>Like a man!</p>
<p>Hell yeah, dude, a man?</p>
<p>Don't even joke about hunting a man.</p>
<p>Who's joking?</p>
<p>I'm not joking.</p>
<p>I think that hunting a man would be the only true test of a good hunter.</p>
<p>Yeah? I was hunted once.</p>
<p>I just came back from Nam.</p>
<p>I was hitching through Oregon and some cop started harassing me.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, I had a whole army of cops chasing me through the woods.</p>
<p>I had to take 'em all out.</p>
<p>It was a bloodbath.</p>
<p>That's Rambo, dude.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You just described the plot of Rambo.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the first from the first one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you gave us the life of the Rambo.</p>
<p>That's not the first time you've described your life in the way of John Rambo's like.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>It's actually making me think I can get on board with man-hunt.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Me, too, dude.</p>
<p>I'm just throw that out there.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You do not go on a man-hunt.</p>
<p>Screw ya.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia 4x01 - Mac and Dennis: Manhunters 1st Aired: 9/18/2008 (FX)</em></p>
<p>Try that one.</p>
<p>This one?</p>
<p>Hu-hum.</p>
<p>Good, a little bit of sauce with.</p>
<p>We don't have any slice left.</p>
<p>It was just the The Natural Juice of two by the way.</p>
<p>Oh, so good!</p>
<p>It's not actual sauce.</p>
<p>Oh, my god, good job!</p>
<p>I can't believe that dick horrible put the lock on the refrigerator.</p>
<p>What a sonofabitch.</p>
<p>That wasn't cool.</p>
<p>You know what though?</p>
<p>At least he forgot about this piece.</p>
<p>What a dump ass.</p>
<p>Did you do something different thought?</p>
<p>'cause it's sooo good this time.</p>
<p>I barely cooked it.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I'm talking like not at all.</p>
<p>No kiddin'.</p>
<p>Hu hum.</p>
<p>What I did, I slopped through the radiator for minute.</p>
<p>That's pretty bogus.</p>
<p>Not warmed it.</p>
<p>No, but it's cleaned up.</p>
<p>It's so good though.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>But here's a good side.</p>
<p>Well, well, well~.</p>
<p>What have we here.</p>
<p>Looks like you two're up and enjoying my meat!</p>
<p>Yes, we have a new fashious meat hug.</p>
<p>Yeah, hey, Franky.</p>
<p>Sharing it.</p>
<p>It's a rule now~.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe we should open up a bottle of desert wine.</p>
<p>A nice port, that would compliment what you have just eaten.</p>
<p>By the way, you know what you've just eaten, right?</p>
<p>Was it venison?</p>
<p>You wish it was venison.</p>
<p>Was it a horse?</p>
<p>Horse?</p>
<p>That, which you have just eaten, that, which your teeth have just torn apart.</p>
<p>Your taste buds have savored, that was human meat.</p>
<p>Yeah, ok.</p>
<p>So stupid.</p>
<p>You're so stupid!</p>
<p>Well, thank you for the human meat, Frank.</p>
<p>Thank you for our human meat.</p>
<p>No, you're welcome.</p>
<p>It was delicious.</p>
<p>I knew you're gonna steal from me again.</p>
<p>You're stupid.</p>
<p>That's why I put a lock on the fridge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And only left one piece of meat out.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Human meat.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Where'd you get the human meat from, Frank?</p>
<p>I got a guy.</p>
<p>You got a guy?</p>
<p>Oh, you got a human meat guy?</p>
<p>I got a guide for everything, Charlie.</p>
<p>You're so full of shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, ok, right. - Oh, yeah, Deandra, you think I'm full of shit? - Hu hum.</p>
<p>Well, you enjoy yourselves, now.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I am glad you had a good time eating human meat.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That wasn't human meat though, right?</p>
<p>No~~~!</p>
<p>Hey yo.</p>
<p>Dennis, I did it.</p>
<p>It took me all day, but I finally finished a list of ten people that would be perfect to hunt.</p>
<p>Great, and I totally respect your opinion, but I've already made a decision.</p>
<p>That's the complete opposite of respecting my opinion.</p>
<p>Hey, don't I know it.</p>
<p>Check it out, bro.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Dennis, are you sure Dee is coming?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, she's coming.</p>
<p>She wants to look great for your big date.</p>
<p>Do I get that right? Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, he's perfect.</p>
<p>You don't believe?</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>Hey, Cricket, will you, come out here for few second please.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just stand before us here.</p>
<p>Now, check out his legs.</p>
<p>See how they're almost tierd?</p>
<p>They're like pretty much back to perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And check out his cane.</p>
<p>Looks like he's whittled it into some sort of defensive tool.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But, that makes you quite formidable, huh?</p>
<p>Ok, what's going on here, huh?</p>
<p>Where is Dee?</p>
<p>Admit it, Mac.</p>
<p>He's perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he'll do just fine.</p>
<p>Oh, god, oh, god.</p>
<p>I know you're up to something.</p>
<p>You're gonna harvest my organs, aren't you?</p>
<p>Yeah, Hey, relax.</p>
<p>You're gonna rope me and you're gonna harvest my organs.</p>
<p>Relax, Cricket, relax, relax, take it easy.</p>
<p>You don't wanna be all nervous and sweaty when Dee gets here.</p>
<p>It's ture she's coming?</p>
<p>Ok, ok.</p>
<p>Yeah, for second there, I thought you guys're gonna do something terrible to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are.</p>
<p>Stack on 'em.</p>
<p>No, we're gonna hunt you.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We are going to hunt you, Cricket.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Uh.. I'll spend a lot less time asking questions, more time running.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, what happens if.. if I get caught?</p>
<p>Wu, don't get caught.</p>
<p>Don't get caught.</p>
<p>There he goes and hunt begins!</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed.</p>
<p>-This gonna be fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you suppose gonna happen when we do catch him?</p>
<p>Well, I suppose we do some tea-bag related.</p>
<p>Hum Dee!</p>
<p>You're home, thank god.</p>
<p>Ok, let's talk. Let's have a quick conversation, huh? What do you think?</p>
<p>I couldn't sleep last night, could you?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>Yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Oh my god, Charlie.</p>
<p>I didn't wanna say anything, but I'm thinking there's some strange going on with this meat, such a wish.</p>
<p>Yes, ok, now, I know it's crazy.</p>
<p>The idea Frank feeding us human meat.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>But, I'm trying to disapprove it.</p>
<p>I absolutely can.</p>
<p>You can't do it, can you?</p>
<p>Let's talk to taste.</p>
<p>The taste! - The taste, Charlie, I tried everything.</p>
<p>I can't get the taste out of my mouth!</p>
<p>You can't get it out, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And if you try all source of other meats, Yes! like daily meats and sandwich meats.</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>And then did you go crazy?</p>
<p>Just looking everything in your apartment, like your shoe, item with a catch fanny, like nothing's working, right?</p>
<p>Maybe, it's a trick.</p>
<p>Ok? Maybe, he went and got some weird, exotic meat that we wouldn't thank to try.</p>
<p>Ok, it's not like regular grocery store kind of meat.</p>
<p>No, not meat from a grocery store.</p>
<p>He got it from some weird place.</p>
<p>Ok, let's, let's think here.</p>
<p>Let's put our heads together.</p>
<p>Where could Frank go to get mysterious meat?</p>
<p>This is the place, huh?</p>
<p>This is where I can find.</p>
<p>Just start grabbing as much stuff as you can.</p>
<p>Ok, we'll take, um, that big brown mound and the curly stuff and then this thing looks like a blanket.</p>
<p>Try some of that.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, what about a monkey?</p>
<p>Monkeys are like nature's humans.</p>
<p>I doubt they have monkey, Charlie.</p>
<p>People eat monkey, Dee.</p>
<p>They're eating type of doom.</p>
<p>Have you ever see that?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>We got monkey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, we'll look at that.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Uh, one monkey also then, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, baby. This hunt is gonna be so awesome, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, bud. This is what it must feel like, before you go to battle.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I know man.</p>
<p>I'm so exited, feel my nips.</p>
<p>Holy smokes!</p>
<p>They're, like, super hard, right?</p>
<p>You can cut glass with these bad boys.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm feeling his nips, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, I'm so exited for this hunt and my nips are doing stuff they've never done before.</p>
<p>Feel 'em. - Look at these.</p>
<p>What hunt?</p>
<p>We're gonna hunt Cricket.</p>
<p>I thought we went over this already.</p>
<p>You do not hunt a man.</p>
<p>Come on, man. Don't bring it down, not right now.</p>
<p>Not when my nips are like this.</p>
<p>You know you hunt a man, he can snap like a toig.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, he's up at night, he's burning down a village of Nam, he's killing everything that moves, everything that lives!</p>
<p>You're talking about Rambo again.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>That happened to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're thinking about John Rambo's life, every time.</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>This happened to me.</p>
<p>That never happened to you, Frank.</p>
<p>It happened to me, Mac.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're confused your life with Rambo again.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, Charlie. This is not right. I still have the crazy.</p>
<p>I have, too. I have even worse than before I take.</p>
<p>There's something really weirdoes happening to me.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what's going on.</p>
<p>Frank bet it's human meat, and we got the hunger.</p>
<p>The hunger?</p>
<p>Hu hum.</p>
<p>That's how you become a cannibal, Dee.</p>
<p>Like, you get one taste of delicious, delicious human meat, none of these stuff ever satisfies you, ever again for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Now, I just think that you're overreacting, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's stupid.</p>
<p>Is that stupid?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, Dee.</p>
<p>Well, then I guess Jaws IV is stupid, ok?</p>
<p>'cause that's exact same plot.</p>
<p>Ok, alright. Calm down.</p>
<p>Before you start accusing us of becoming cannibals or sharks or whatever is you're trying to say, I think we need to find out if what we ate was actually human.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. That's what we've been doing.</p>
<p>I ate a fu** monkey, Dee.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>You don't understand me.</p>
<p>I think we need to try a piece of human flesh.</p>
<p>Oh, god.</p>
<p>Just to make sure.</p>
<p>That's the only way.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>How're we gonna do this?</p>
<p>The morgue?</p>
<p>Hear me out.</p>
<p>It's a dead body...</p>
<p>Sold.</p>
<p>You don't even have to tell me, man.</p>
<p>That's where you find a dead body, right?</p>
<p>Great idea, right?</p>
<p>We'll have a tiny little bit.</p>
<p>They won't even know.</p>
<p>We'll be off the hook.</p>
<p>Well, no for sure.</p>
<p>I got a hot plate.</p>
<p>I wanna get some beers.</p>
<p>Any sight of him?</p>
<p>No, but uh, word on the street is he's out of here begging must Saturdays.</p>
<p>He'll be here.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>God, hunting is awesome, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You get to wear sweet clothes and get wasted all day.</p>
<p>It's just like our normal lives, except at the end of it we get to put our nuts in some dude's mouth.</p>
<p>Ah... yeah, actually I wanted to talk to you about that aspect of it.</p>
<p>What's up? You're not happy with the plan?</p>
<p>No, now look, we'd been tea-bagging Cricket since high school, you know?</p>
<p>I feel like we need to make some progress.</p>
<p>I think we should give him a gorilla mask.</p>
<p>What's a gorilla mask?</p>
<p>You put some sticky over his face, and then sprinkle it with shaved pubes.</p>
<p>Umm, no, I don't like it.</p>
<p>What? What's not to like?</p>
<p>Cricket with a face full of pubes?</p>
<p>Hilarious!</p>
<p>Yeah, but where're we supposed to get that many pubes, man?</p>
<p>We shave!</p>
<p>Now, that's gonna be a problem, I laser.</p>
<p>It's like a turtle shell down there.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, look man.</p>
<p>The classic surculose for reason, ok?</p>
<p>Why going nuts with that?</p>
<p>It's called progress, Dennis.</p>
<p>Well, I wanna make progress.</p>
<p>So, I'm sticking with the tea-bagging.</p>
<p>But tea-bagging doesn't even leave a mark!</p>
<p>Well, fine, I'll dip my nuts in ink or something and then put it in his mouth, that make you happy?</p>
<p>Well... Yeah, actually, I think that's a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it leaves a mark all over it, and..</p>
<p>Holy shit, let me just hunt.</p>
<p>It's an excellent idea.</p>
<p>It's like we can dunk him down and, like hooo~</p>
<p>Cheers, man, let me went through that.</p>
<p>See? We're free thinking outside hot.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Cricket! Get him.</p>
<p>Get, get, get, get!</p>
<p>Ok, how did his legs just do that?</p>
<p>I'm not doing that, Dennis.</p>
<p>No, that was incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>Let's go pow chop in that case.</p>
<p>Did not know what he was capable of.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Sorry to bug you here.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>We're two friends of one of the dead people that you have in there.</p>
<p>Close friends.</p>
<p>And we wanted to..</p>
<p>Spent some time..</p>
<p>We wanted to say good-bye.</p>
<p>Say good-bye to her and or.. to him I think.</p>
<p>He had a... had long life that was good and..</p>
<p>What's the hot plate for?</p>
<p>The hot plate..</p>
<p>The hot plate is.. because.. our friend was a..</p>
<p>He was a chef. a chef.</p>
<p>Of small.. who puts small..</p>
<p>Plates of ... many small items on hot plate.</p>
<p>Of course, he just heated it up.</p>
<p>And we thought maybe if he saw or he's near to hot plate one more time...</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Look, I respect the act.</p>
<p>I'll give you guys the same deal like I gave every else.</p>
<p>15 bucks get you 10 minutes alone with the bodies.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What're you talking about?</p>
<p>I must say thought, I've never seen a guy and a girl bang one of these taste at the same time.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me, guy?</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>You've got the wrong idea. That's really gross.</p>
<p>Wow, you got a wrong idea about us.</p>
<p>We were gonna have, we were just gonna come and have a bite a bit, I mean..</p>
<p>I don't..</p>
<p>Wait, I don't judge you guys. It's cool.</p>
<p>I like yogurt up my ass and a popsicle stick in my mouth, that's all. - Oh my god, man.</p>
<p>You know what? Let's just give this guy 15 bucks.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to say.</p>
<p>What up, man?</p>
<p>You're the one with the hot plate.</p>
<p>No, that is... much worse.</p>
<p>Weirdo.</p>
<p>Ok, I'm a weirdo, says the guy, who yogurt up his ass.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>These are dead bodies.</p>
<p>Two dead, two dead guys.</p>
<p>It's the real deal here.</p>
<p>I don't think I can eat this guy.</p>
<p>No, I don't think I can, right?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I don't, I don't know.</p>
<p>It's not because he's black, though, right?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Ok, I..</p>
<p>No! What, no! I still think so, no!</p>
<p>It's because he's dead, right?</p>
<p>It's because he's dead, that's why not.</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>Now, I got a question for you.</p>
<p>We're racist if we don't eat this guy?</p>
<p>Oh, shit, Charlie.</p>
<p>Now it is.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Dee. I just thought white guy over here looks better than him for some reason.</p>
<p>He looks so much better, doesn't he? What is that?</p>
<p>I don't know, you know what it is?</p>
<p>I generally, I don't eat dark meat.</p>
<p>No, I've preferred the white meat. I always have.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it's not that guy.</p>
<p>No, it has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>The problem is I'm gonna have a really hard time for both cannibals and racist.</p>
<p>We're not, Dee.</p>
<p>I wanna just make sure.</p>
<p>Cannibalism? Racism, Dee?</p>
<p>That's not for us.</p>
<p>You know, those are the decisions that're best left to the suits on Washington.</p>
<p>Ok? We're just here to eat some dude.</p>
<p>Well, I'm, you lost me with Washington, but the rest I agree with, so let's eat a piece of this white guy.</p>
<p>Let's get him.</p>
<p>I don't think I can do it.</p>
<p>No, me neither.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hey, the good news is that means we're not racist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p>Ok, ok, ok.</p>
<p>I made it.</p>
<p>I'm fastest, I finished this lane.</p>
<p>I beat you, bitches.</p>
<p>Hey, shreep rat.</p>
<p>Don't move!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>I'm not here to kill you.</p>
<p>I'm here to help you turn the tables on Mac and Dennis.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I wanna show those bastards today, it ain't ok to hunt humans.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>They drew first blood, not you.</p>
<p>They what?</p>
<p>They drew first blood!</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that a...</p>
<p>Is that Rambo?</p>
<p>No, I made that up.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That's Rambo.</p>
<p>You want me to help you or not?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Well, come on. Let's go.</p>
<p>Get up.</p>
<p>Tag!</p>
<p>You're it!</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Tag, you're it? And a knife?</p>
<p>What the hell is this, man?</p>
<p>Why are you laughing?</p>
<p>Stop laughing, dude.</p>
<p>This is serious shit!</p>
<p>Yeah? Huh?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh my god. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>You gorilla masked me?</p>
<p>Yes! Bro, you gotta admit. I had so much more awesome than tea-bagging.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Take a look at your mouth, you tell me.</p>
<p>You put your balls in my mouth while I was sleeping?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, twice.</p>
<p>That's rape.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>That is borderline rape.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro, you got a lot of people care.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess not.</p>
<p>Jesus, man. What's with the note?</p>
<p>I mean what's with the our tricks.</p>
<p>No, I didn't leave it.</p>
<p>I thought you left it.</p>
<p>So it was Cricket.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Ok, Cricket got to us.</p>
<p>He got to us.</p>
<p>Oh, damn! He got to us, Dennis.</p>
<p>Ok, the good news is the gorilla mask, the purple tea-bag both totally viable options, right?</p>
<p>Ok, the bad news is..</p>
<p>It looks like Cricket finally snapped.</p>
<p>We may have pushed him to far, Dennis.</p>
<p>What do you think he's gonna do?</p>
<p>We need to get to him first.</p>
<p>We need to set a trap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then how do you catch a cricket?</p>
<p>With a giant bird.</p>
<p>Dee, would you calm down? You're eating that cheese steak like a some kind of giant bird, you know?</p>
<p>I can't help it, Charlie.</p>
<p>You know, I got an insatiable hunger.</p>
<p>Oh, I know what that hunger is, you know?</p>
<p>Stop telling me about the hunger, Ok?</p>
<p>I'm feeling a good. - Is it?</p>
<p>Now, let's just go back to the morgue, ok? This is shit.</p>
<p>No, that place is terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, none of those were terrible.</p>
<p>Don't think about that.</p>
<p>Look, Dee.</p>
<p>We're cannibals now. although it's pretty obvious to me.</p>
<p>I started to look that, but isn't it?</p>
<p>That's a fact, Dee.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>Look, if we don't feed the hunger, we can die for that.</p>
<p>It's not our fault.</p>
<p>It's nature.</p>
<p>That's nature! That's what happens, people die from the hunger.</p>
<p>Oh my god. All the time that happens.</p>
<p>We don't want that to happen.</p>
<p>Oh my god, that happened to me.</p>
<p>It won't happen to you?</p>
<p>No, I want it happen to me, but I'm not going back to that morgue.</p>
<p>Oh, we gotta do something about it.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, oh, I wanted to eat that lady so bad.</p>
<p>I did, too. I did, too.</p>
<p>We're gonna have to do it.</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>We're gonna have to find a living human being.</p>
<p>No, no, you know why? I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>Because it's dead meat, and dead meat is bad meat.</p>
<p>No, not the morgue.</p>
<p>I'm with you on this.</p>
<p>On this thing.</p>
<p>I never wanted that before, I wanna know.</p>
<p>I know, but I wanna know.</p>
<p>We gotta find a guy.</p>
<p>We gotta kill that guy, and we gotta eat it.</p>
<p>Somebody, little rotten maybe.</p>
<p>Somebody..</p>
<p>That nobody will start asking questions about, if he's missing.</p>
<p>I mean, when we do that, we don't want any gushers.</p>
<p>I don't wanna get caught.</p>
<p>Someone no in the world could ever care about.</p>
<p>Small change?</p>
<p>Hungry Please help.</p>
<p>Aho.</p>
<p>I can't do this.</p>
<p>They're not coming off, seriously.</p>
<p>Oh, no, they're not going to.</p>
<p>I used airplane glue, bro.</p>
<p>That's gonna be your look for a while.</p>
<p>Now, run me through how we're gonna do this with Dee.</p>
<p>I'll talk her to it. Don't.</p>
<p>Dee, ah, great. We need to use you as bait for our Cricket.</p>
<p>Screw up.</p>
<p>What in the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>No, no, we don't wanna know his name.</p>
<p>Go away!</p>
<p>No, wait, wait, Dee.</p>
<p>What? Oh my god no.</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You know what kid?</p>
<p>You gotta get out of here, man.</p>
<p>You gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>It's not safe here.</p>
<p>We can't do this.</p>
<p>No. Charlie, listen to me, listen to me good.</p>
<p>If we don't eat this kid, we're gonna die. You know it.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I wanna eat him as much as you wanna eat him, but it's wrong to do it.</p>
<p>No, it's a..</p>
<p>It's wrong that, going back to the street!</p>
<p>Damn it! Damn it!</p>
<p>So, you're gonna eat that kid.</p>
<p>No, you don't know.</p>
<p>You don't have the hunger.</p>
<p>You know? We don't give a shit about any of these.</p>
<p>Dee? Cricket trap bait? You?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hey, Frank.</p>
<p>Hooray.</p>
<p>Speaker, yeah, hold on.</p>
<p>Is Dennis with you?</p>
<p>Uh.. yeah.</p>
<p>Good, back in Dennis, prepare to be burned alive.</p>
<p>This is the point where I normally burn you alive, but I just did it to prove a point that I think I made my point.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank. Hey, Frank.</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>Hey, Franky.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Good to see you, man.</p>
<p>Hey, look.</p>
<p>Can you get us more like human meat?</p>
<p>Bodies, please.</p>
<p>Are you still going on about the meat?</p>
<p>I didn't feed you human meat.</p>
<p>It was a raccoon.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You ate raccoon meat.</p>
<p>I told you it was people, because I wanted to freak you out, because you're stealing my food.</p>
<p>No! No, no.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Then why am I always hungry? And stomach pains?</p>
<p>And nothing satisfies the hunger?</p>
<p>You probably got a tapeworm.</p>
<p>Raccoon meat is lousy with parasites.</p>
<p>Ok, are we done here?</p>
<p>Because we're bored of shit.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. Not yet.</p>
<p>Get ready, for a mouthful... of strawberry blond haired, covered balls.</p>
<p>Frank? Grab 'em.</p>
<p>We're not doing that.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>What do you mean we're not doing it.</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What, what is it with you people?</p>
<p>I mean, you guys are always touching each other's nipples, putting your balls in each other's mouths.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's fun.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>I just don't understand your generation.</p>
<p>Raccoon meat!</p>
<p>Ball shit!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That was human meat, I know it.</p>
<p>Look, I don't give you a shit what you think.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I gotta chop off that pieces of that fellow calf muscle of yours, Frank.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna eat it.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Charlie.</p>
<p>We're gonna put it on the hot plate, right?</p>
<p>Get him!</p>
<p>Oh, you can't run way from me!</p>
<p>Well, I guess the hunt is all once bagan.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is.</p>
<p>Oh, they're gonna have so much fun, man.</p>
<p>Oh, those two are gonna have blast, huh?</p>
<p>So, I guess the only thing that's left is to figure out what to do with Mr. Cricket.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh.</p>
<p>What to do, what to do.</p>
<p>Guess it's just us.</p>
<p>It's just you and us, and a..</p>
<p>Couple pairs of sour sweaty balls.</p>
