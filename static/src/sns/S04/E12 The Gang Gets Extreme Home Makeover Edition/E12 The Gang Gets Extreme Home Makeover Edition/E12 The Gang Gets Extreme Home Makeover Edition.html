<p><em>Admit it, dude.</p>
<p>You totally cried.</p>
<p>I didn't cry, Charlie.</p>
<p>I saw tears coming out of your eye...</em></p>
<p>Extreme Home Makeover will make the hardest man soft.</p>
<p>Oh, it makes everybody cry.</p>
<p>That is really ridiculous.</p>
<p>Oh, is it?</p>
<p>You're the biggest thief I've ever met in my life.</p>
<p>Dennis, do you know that she is inheriting my house?</p>
<p>Of course he knows it. He's the one who lost the house by letting you into it.</p>
<p>And now since I'm his next of kin the house belongs to me.</p>
<p>Frank, if you want to get your house back, check it out.</p>
<p>Make a vision board, put your house on it... boom.</p>
<p>You get the house back.</p>
<p>What the hell's a vision board?</p>
<p>Oh, it's the secret.</p>
<p>Yeah, the secret is a self-help book that Dee read and explained to us.</p>
<p>It's about how you can get whatever you want without having to work for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, all you have to do is envision all the shit in the world that you want, cut pictures of it out and paste it on a board, and then you get it. You get the stuff.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>See how I got all these sweet pics of Ty Pennington from Extreme Home Makeover?</p>
<p>I'm gonna become like him.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have that dude's life.</p>
<p>Yeah, now, that's Charlie's vision, but it's not mine.</p>
<p>You see, my vision is to have a gorgeous yellow Lamborghini that I'm very much looking forward to driving.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm gonna impregnate Danica Patrick while getting drunk in the Sahara Desert on a dune buggy.</p>
<p>I hate to tell you this, but, you know, this self-help stuff... it's all bullshit. It's a big scam.</p>
<p>Oh, is it, Frank? That's funny, 'cause that's how I got the house.</p>
<p>See, I envisioned the courts recognizing how ridiculous it was that my son of a bitch, asshole mother didn't leave me anything and then I did some good deeds and boom, I'm rich. Mansion rich.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>You didn't say anything about doing good deeds. Is that a part of this?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, that's part of it.</p>
<p>You have to do that.</p>
<p>You get back what you put in.</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>That's probably why Ty Pennington has such a sweet life.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, and he's got great hair, too.</p>
<p>Of course he's got great hair.</p>
<p>You know, this has got me thinking, guys.</p>
<p>It could be really beneficial for us to go out and actually do some good deeds.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Maybe helping other people is the best way to help ourselves.</p>
<p>Right, right. So like what is the best way you can help other people?</p>
<p>The best way in the world to help other people.</p>
<p>What would Ty Pennington do?</p>
<p>What would Ty Pennington do?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doin' with my bowling ball?</p>
<p>It's no longer a bowling ball, Frank, it's now a wrecking ball.</p>
<p>We're gonna use it to tear down a house and then we're gonna build up a dream.</p>
<p>Yeah, baby. And then we get our Lamborghinis and our Danica Patricks and...</p>
<p>Whatever we want.</p>
<p>Ooh, you guys.</p>
<p>I want to jump in on this if that's okay, 'cause I ran the numbers and I'm gonna need a butt load of money to pay the property taxes on my new mansion.</p>
<p>My mansion.</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank, really still?</p>
<p>Why do you care?</p>
<p>You don't even want to live there.</p>
<p>That's not the point, Deandra... the point is it is my house and I should own it!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. Help us out and the universe'll probably give it back to you.</p>
<p>I don't think so, Charlie. See, I'm operating at a much higher vibration which I think is gonna counteract his attempts at positive energy.</p>
<p>I'll keep the house.</p>
<p>You think that your energy's more positive than mine?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>I want in on this so I can screw over Deandra.</p>
<p>You know what, man?</p>
<p>Perfect, because we were planning on using your construction experience and your connections anyway.</p>
<p>I'll be the foreman.</p>
<p>Yeah, great, excellent.</p>
<p>Well, then why don't you hop on the renovations with Charlie and I... Mac, why don't you get started on the family makeover with Dee.</p>
<p>Family makeover with Dee? No, I want to be a part of the renovation team.</p>
<p>I know you do, but the thing is...</p>
<p>You get so excited about the smashing and then you make it competitive.</p>
<p>You turn it into a competition.</p>
<p>That's bullshit, because I'm a better smasher than you guys!</p>
<p>I should be on the head of the smashing team!</p>
<p>You want to have a smash off?</p>
<p>A smash off?!</p>
<p>You can't even help yourself, can you?</p>
<p>Okay, fine, fine.</p>
<p>Dee and I are gonna kick your ass, okay.</p>
<p>Because our makeover is gonna be so much more extreme than yours.</p>
<p>Well, now hold on a second.</p>
<p>Charlie, our renovations are gonna be pretty extreme, right?</p>
<p>Let's-let's all agree that we're gonna go about this in the most extreme way possible, okay.</p>
<p>First things first, let's find a family to unleash our extremeness all over.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, a desperate family that's gonna yield us the highest return.</p>
<p>How about the Mexican family that moved in down the block?</p>
<p>Right. What is their name?</p>
<p>The Juarez family I think.</p>
<p>Oh, that's perfect!</p>
<p>We can help the Juarez family.</p>
<p>Great. Great.</p>
<p>They're good, they're good.</p>
<p>Their place is a real shit-hole.</p>
<p>Okay, great, then the Juarez family it is. It's settled.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, and I think I know the most extreme way to go about this.</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, you got the blindfolds, right?</p>
<p>Well, do you guys think that the blindfolds are absolutely necessary?</p>
<p>Yes, the blindfolds are necessary.</p>
<p>They're there to heighten the sense of surprise and excitement creating an enjoyable experience for the family... extreme!</p>
<p>Okay, but here's the thing.</p>
<p>I couldn't find any blindfolds per say, but I did bring some plastic bags.</p>
<p>Ok, here we go, bitchies...</p>
<p>Go! Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><em>Good morning, Juarez family!</em></p>
<p>Wake up, my brown friend.</p>
<p>It's time to change your life.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Is that inspirational music, what is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, inspirational.</p>
<p>All right, that's cool.</p>
<p>That's cool, I guess.</p>
<p>Come here, you little rug rat.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What's wrong, buddy?</p>
<p>Come on, I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p>Hey, where's your wife?</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Look, I'm gonna fix your house.</p>
<p>Where's your daughter?</p>
<p>Where's your daughter?</p>
<p><em>Congratulations!</p>
<p>We've got a surprise for you.</em></p>
<p>Okay, hold still.</p>
<p>Can't run from the kindness of strangers.</p>
<p><em>We are taking over your house.</p>
<p>Your house is ours now!</p>
<p>Your lives are gonna change forever.</em></p>
<p>Oh, it feels good to help people.</p>
<p>Oh, man, it sure does.</p>
<p><em>Okay, bag 'em.</p>
<p>And good-bye, Juarez family.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, all right!</p>
<p>Good job! Good job!</p>
<p>Hey, foreman, what's the plan?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman.</p>
<p>The plan?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys get to work.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go hop in one of their beds and get some shut-eye.</p>
<p>I'm running on fumes.</p>
<p>Hey, man, there's no time for that.</p>
<p>We're on a deadline here.</p>
<p>Now, when's your crew arriving?</p>
<p>My crew, what crew?</p>
<p>The construction crew.</p>
<p>When do those guys get here?</p>
<p>You-you're the crew.</p>
<p>That's the way I do it.</p>
<p>I hire two guys and let them sweat it out.</p>
<p>All right, now, keep it down because I'm a very light sleeper.</p>
<p>Welcome to makeover headquarters, Juarez family!</p>
<p>This is gonna be your home for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Hey, in order to assimilate you with American culture, we've decided to surround you with all things American.</p>
<p>Now who's ready for a makeover?</p>
<p>This one is.</p>
<p>Um, not that excited.</p>
<p>No, not that excited at all.</p>
<p>I... okay, I think there might be a bit of a language barrier.</p>
<p>Well, that could be an issue.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, hold up, uh, somebody took a couple years of Spanish in high school.</p>
<p>Okay, you rember?</p>
<p>I'm gonna dust off the cobwebs and see if I can fire off a couple phrases.</p>
<p>Tell them, um, to relax first off 'cause they look a little tense.</p>
<p>And then, uh, we're gonna build them a new house and a new life just like on Extreme Makeover on TV.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Juarez, be easy.</p>
<p>Your house is no more.</p>
<p>Your life is no more.</p>
<p>We are extreme.</p>
<p>Like television.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>See, they get it.</p>
<p>I still got it.</p>
<p>They get it.</p>
<p>We are extreme!</p>
<p>Yeah, America!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, man, the more I look at this place, the nicer I think it is, you know?</p>
<p>It's a nice place.</p>
<p>No, it's a very charming, charming place.</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Why are you smashing stuff?</p>
<p>I smashed it.</p>
<p>It's important that we get rid of anything that will remind the Juarez family of their old country.</p>
<p>Bro, they're Americans now.</p>
<p>Americans don't hold on to the past.</p>
<p>Oh, the past isn't useful.</p>
<p>You got to forget about it.</p>
<p>Okay, the past isn't...</p>
<p>We got to gut this entire place.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm thinking now.</p>
<p>After we got done smashing all their old shit, I'm thinking we take out this wall. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Just let the room breathe a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay, and you think that's better than just, like, ripping the whole house down, just...</p>
<p>Yeah, why...</p>
<p>...tearing the whole thing down?</p>
<p>Were you planning on destroying the entire house?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We can't demolish the entire house.</p>
<p>That's what they do on Extreme Makeover.</p>
<p>They rip the whole house down.</p>
<p>Do you know how to build an entire house?</p>
<p>No, I don't know how to...</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, I hadn't thought that far... we would have to build a whole house.</p>
<p>Yeah, we would have to build a new...</p>
<p>I can't build a whole house.</p>
<p>You know what, let's just smash the one wall.</p>
<p>And then, we'll throw a couple layers of paint up, and then we'll get our Lamborghinis and...</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Let me see if the lamp takes a little dent out of it.</p>
<p>And... here comes the pitch.</p>
<p>Oh, it didn't really dent the wall, though.</p>
<p>No, but it did break the lamp, and that's part of this.</p>
<p>It did break the lamp.</p>
<p>I'm gonna break this.</p>
<p>What's... what's all the racket down here?</p>
<p>Hey, some of us are trying to do some work here, Frank.</p>
<p>I don't know if you noticed.</p>
<p>Has anybody scored on their vision board yet?</p>
<p>How on Earth can we score on our vision boards...</p>
<p>We just started.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've been doing this for like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>30 minutes? I feel like I've been sleeping for a day.</p>
<p>That broke bastard's bed is soft as shit.</p>
<p>You think they got any beer in the icebox?</p>
<p>I could drink a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Frank, you are a terrible foreman.</p>
<p>You know what, back me up on this, Charlie.</p>
<p>You're out of here, dude.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>You're... you're done.</p>
<p>You can't kick the foreman out.</p>
<p>I'm the foreman.</p>
<p>I tell you what to do.</p>
<p>That's the way it works.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're gonna tell me how it works?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I watch Extreme Home Makeover.</p>
<p>I know how it works. What?</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>That show is just a bunch of manipulation to get people to cry, and then, they trick the viewers into buying shit.</p>
<p>Buying shit?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>That show is about how awesome Sears is!</p>
<p>And how much Sears products save people's lives!</p>
<p>And it's about caring and Sears and...</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not...</p>
<p>Now, you don't see Ty Pennington losing his cool.</p>
<p>Do you want to be like him?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, well, then, just breathe for me.</p>
<p>Feel what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, dude, I just...</p>
<p>I'm sorry, bro, but I get very passionate about Sears...</p>
<p>I mean, Extreme Home Make...</p>
<p>I mean, what... what...</p>
<p>Helping people.</p>
<p>Helping people.</p>
<p>Don't stop.</p>
<p>I don't understand why this is happening.</p>
<p>Our visas came through, yes?</p>
<p>I don't think these people are the INS.</p>
<p>I think we're been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Baseball.</p>
<p>Frank, what the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Those dick wads threw me off my own work site.</p>
<p>So, how's the old vision board coming?</p>
<p>You getting everything you want?</p>
<p>No, actually, we just started the whole makeover process.</p>
<p>Yeah, we realized the reason why the Juarez family hasn't achieved the American dream yet is because they haven't envisioned it strong enough.</p>
<p>Right, so we're having them do their own visions board, so here.</p>
<p>Why don't you be a lamb and pass out some materials.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Be helpful.</p>
<p>Do something positive with your life, piece of shit.</p>
<p>Magazines, magazines.</p>
<p>Here... magazines.</p>
<p>And cut them out with this.</p>
<p>What are you looking at?</p>
<p>She doesn't understand what you're saying.</p>
<p>No, no, you got to say, "Corta".</p>
<p>That means "cut".</p>
<p>Corta, corta!</p>
<p>I am gonna blast your face off.</p>
<p>Okay, what did you...</p>
<p>No one's gonna blast your face.</p>
<p>No one's gonna do that.</p>
<p>What did you say to her?</p>
<p>I said what you said to say to her, and she stabbed me in the leg with the goddamn scissors.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>All right, all right, okay.</p>
<p>Lower your cutting tool, please.</p>
<p>Man is crazy with gun.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And make danger for all of us.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, careful, watch it.</p>
<p>Don't make man hurt you.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>That makes sense, yeah?</p>
<p>They got it.</p>
<p>I'm really good at this.</p>
<p>Dennis, yo.</p>
<p>Last-minute thing.</p>
<p>God, I have this brilliant idea.</p>
<p>We need a project for him, dude.</p>
<p>You know, we got ourselves a little Mexican girl here, and I'm thinking... what does a little Mexican girl love more than anything else in the world?</p>
<p>Tacos.</p>
<p>Tacos, buddy.</p>
<p>So, why not make for her a taco bed?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She gets to, like, be in a taco every day.</p>
<p>So, okay, I got yellow sheets... that's cheese.</p>
<p>Green: guacamole.</p>
<p>Red: a little pillow for salsa.</p>
<p>And I got these cute little brown PJs so that she gets to feel like ground meat while she's sleeping.</p>
<p>She's the ground meat in the middle.</p>
<p>She's the ground meat in the middle.</p>
<p>I like that, man.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>What is this blowtorch for, man?</p>
<p>Well, that's a propane torch.</p>
<p>That thing's badass, man.</p>
<p>It's like a flamethrower.</p>
<p>But what function is it gonna serve in the home?</p>
<p>It's for the renovation, man.</p>
<p>It's for the controlled burns.</p>
<p>I don't think they do controlled burns, man.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Bro, they definitely do controlled burns.</p>
<p>They do it off screen.</p>
<p>Off screen.</p>
<p>How do you think they tear down an entire wall so quickly?</p>
<p>They burn it up.</p>
<p>The community has got a lot to do with it, and then, maybe it's for burning the extra rubble.</p>
<p>It's for tearing stuff down.</p>
<p>Are you sure we need it?</p>
<p>They take stuff outside and...</p>
<p>I'm not sure we...</p>
<p>I'm buying it. So, go ahead and ring that up.</p>
<p>What are we looking at here?</p>
<p>That will be $3,212.11.</p>
<p>We're just gonna go ahead and put all this on the Extreme Home Makeover account.</p>
<p>Ring it up.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>We're performing an extreme home makeover.</p>
<p>So, do you not have a button for that?</p>
<p>We're helping out a family in need, okay?</p>
<p>We're gonna do some good deeds.</p>
<p>You know, we got a vision board thing going.</p>
<p>This is a legitimate operation, okay?</p>
<p>This is the real deal.</p>
<p>I got a whole taco bed.</p>
<p>You know what... if you just give us the stuff, we'll be on our way.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, we don't just give stuff away.</p>
<p>I don't know why you're breaking my balls here.</p>
<p>Sears does this, okay?</p>
<p>Sears gives people stuff.</p>
<p>Sears doesn't get anything out of it.</p>
<p>Sears doesn't come in and start...</p>
<p>Look, we don't have any money, okay?</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do here?</p>
<p>I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>If you don't have a bad credit history, you can open up a store credit card.</p>
<p>Credit card, huh?</p>
<p>All right, just go ahead and sign right there, and we're all set.</p>
<p>Now, this is smart.</p>
<p>The first step to becoming an American... get a credit card.</p>
<p>We need this guy to build up copious amounts of debt.</p>
<p>That is the best way for him to build up his credit.</p>
<p>We're doing him a favor.</p>
<p>We're doing him a huge favor.</p>
<p>And do you realize how extreme this is?</p>
<p>To go from no debt to good old-fashioned American debt?</p>
<p>That's the way to do it.</p>
<p>Plus, I've been envisioning someone else paying for thing the entire time.</p>
<p>I'm also envisioning him unloading all the shit into the car.</p>
<p>Well, that's a great vision.</p>
<p>Guys, no can do.</p>
<p>We're on a very tight schedule.</p>
<p>By the way, does anyone know why the hell Frank has been pointing a camera at us?</p>
<p>I'll tell you why. Because I'm tired of this secret bullshit.</p>
<p>All it got me was a stab wound in the leg.</p>
<p>So, I'm gonna record everything you do.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I know you're gonna fail.</p>
<p>Then, I can watch it over and over again.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Whatever, Frank.</p>
<p>You know, I'm glad you're getting all this on tape because then we'll have proof of how amazingly generous we're being today.</p>
<p>You're going to prove that the secret is real.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we are all done here, so I'm gonna roll 'cause we got to...</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and let's do this.</p>
<p>Mostgracias.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>All right, you got the store card now.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and ring that up.</p>
<p>Bro, I'm not sure I have the right look here.</p>
<p>No, you do, man.</p>
<p>You just got to start thinking of the tool belt as an extension of yourself.</p>
<p>It needs to reflect you as an individual.</p>
<p>Do you feel that?</p>
<p>Is that all that it is?</p>
<p>That's all it is.</p>
<p>All right, let me ask you a question, then.</p>
<p>How come you have that awesome fray in your shorts?</p>
<p>I don't have that.</p>
<p>That, sir, is becauseyou purchased blue jean shorts whereas I purchased blue jeans and cut 'em.</p>
<p>Thus, the fray.</p>
<p>It's a more authentic look.</p>
<p>I think that's what you're feeling.</p>
<p>Why did you cut them so high?</p>
<p>Way higher than mine.</p>
<p>I thought you might ask that.</p>
<p>See, it limits restriction of leg movement.</p>
<p>You're going to get more work done 'cause you got more leg movement.</p>
<p>Well, are you sure about that?</p>
<p>Let me do a little demonstration on you.</p>
<p>Take the tool belt off for a second.</p>
<p>Let me, let me, let me just demonstrate something.</p>
<p>Let's get it down.</p>
<p>Take a wide stance.</p>
<p>Take the widest stance that you possibly can and let me see what that looks like.</p>
<p>Leg movement.</p>
<p>This is, uh...</p>
<p>Go as wide as you can.</p>
<p>If I'm going wide and I'm being honest with you...</p>
<p>I'm maxing out about here.</p>
<p>That's not bad... but check this out.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Any more?</p>
<p>That's it, but that's pretty wide, right?</p>
<p>That is good, you know...</p>
<p>Looks good, right?</p>
<p>And you're not getting any high ride.</p>
<p>I'm getting a high ride.</p>
<p>That's a better...</p>
<p>But the shorts aren't preventing me from doing what I need to do.</p>
<p>And that's the shorts.</p>
<p>That's exactly right, man, and see, your shorts.</p>
<p>They're holding you back, man.</p>
<p>That and your hips, but I got to tell you, the shorts aren't helping.</p>
<p>This, this is really all good shit.</p>
<p>This is like gold.</p>
<p>So what are you going to do next?</p>
<p>You are catching all this, right?</p>
<p>I got everything.</p>
<p>This is what we're gonna do next.</p>
<p>Grab me that propane torch.</p>
<p>I'm gonna burn the wall.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let's go at it with the wrecking ball for a little while.</p>
<p>It'd be more extreme and kind of awesome.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, let's do that, then.</p>
<p>All right, you do the wrecking ball thing... Check this out.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do a little introduction thing, and then you do the wrecking ball.</p>
<p>Do you want to wear the belt?</p>
<p>All right, I'm gonna be the only one wearing the belt?</p>
<p>Just jeans and no shirt.</p>
<p>Wait, can I see the stance one more time?</p>
<p>That... I can go lower.</p>
<p>Bro, that is bad ass.</p>
<p>Yours wedged in, too?</p>
<p>Mine's completely wedged in there.</p>
<p>We can't even get anything past the surface of this thing.</p>
<p>There's, like, a hard surface past the thin surface.</p>
<p>Concrete or brick or something...</p>
<p>I was envisioning this being a lot easier than it's turning out to be.</p>
<p>Abso...</p>
<p>Use the blowtorch.</p>
<p>Great, it's time.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Let me grab the flamethrower.</p>
<p>Hold on a second, time out.</p>
<p>Wait, I think I know what the problem is.</p>
<p>Look, I'm the one who watches Home Makeover.</p>
<p>I think I know what we're not doing right here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We haven't brought the neighborhood in yet.</p>
<p>Absolutely great idea.</p>
<p>Bring the neighbors in.</p>
<p>Oh, my neighbors are great.</p>
<p>So did the neighborhood rob us?</p>
<p>Did the neighborhood rob us?</p>
<p>And they took my goddamn tool belt.</p>
<p>I could not have anticipated...</p>
<p>Look into the camera and cry a little.</p>
<p>You have been in our face with that camera, man.</p>
<p>You know what, man, you know what?</p>
<p>Just... get me the flamethrower.</p>
<p>I'm so sick of this wall, I want to burn it up now.</p>
<p>Okay, it's time.</p>
<p>There's also a fire extinguisher, too.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I think we should use this, man.</p>
<p>I think we should, too.</p>
<p>So here's how this is going to go down.</p>
<p>I will light a fire on the wall.</p>
<p>On the wall.</p>
<p>Have that extinguisher ready, 'cause I don't want the fire to spread past the parameters of this wall.</p>
<p>I will create a parameter with the fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>It's the only safe way to do this, okay?</p>
<p>It'll be perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Then, once the wall's all weakened from the burned-up fires, then we're going to kick it to pieces, smash it to bits, and take the rubble outside and probably burn that, too.</p>
<p>And then I'll put it out with this.</p>
<p>Perfect, and then I'll get started on my taco bed.</p>
<p>That sounds good.</p>
<p>Before you do that, why don't you open that window over there and get a nice backdraft?</p>
<p>Now he wants to start helping us.</p>
<p>That's the first sensible thing you've said all day, Frank.</p>
<p>It's extreme, just like we are.</p>
<p>Go crank open a window.</p>
<p>Let's get a backdraft going.</p>
<p>Frank, you ready?</p>
<p>I've never been ready for anything more in my entire life.</p>
<p>Well, all right.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>I think we have successfully pulled off one extreme makeover.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love their eyes.</p>
<p>Now, while we wait, I was thinking we expose them to some good old-fashioned American cinema.</p>
<p>Apocalypto.</p>
<p>They can learn about how their ancestors used to be savages until Mel Gibson and the Catholics came in and saved everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, you're just in time.</p>
<p>Why don't you point that video camera at the new and improved Juarez family?</p>
<p>They look freaky as shit.</p>
<p>Wait till you get a load of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Pop a squat, bro, 'cause we're going to watch a sweet-ass flick.</p>
<p>I got something better to do.</p>
<p>Bag 'em and bring 'em with us.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yes, let's go.</p>
<p>In fact, bag yourselves, too, because I want this to be a surprise.</p>
<p>Come on, right this way.</p>
<p>Keep walking straight...</p>
<p>Goddamn, it's hard to breathe in these bags.</p>
<p>Okay, hold it right here.</p>
<p>All right, now, excuse me.</p>
<p>Please come over here, the family.</p>
<p>I want you on this side.</p>
<p>My head is sweating like shit.</p>
<p>Take the bags off.</p>
<p>You got, you got a bus, just like in the show.</p>
<p>It's all about the reveal.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>One... two... three!</p>
<p>Move that bus!</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I cannot believe the judge made me give my mansion to the Juarez family.</p>
<p>I can't believe their name isn't Juarez.</p>
<p>Was anyone else surprised by that?</p>
<p>Shocker.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it's a, it's a broken system we got here.</p>
<p>But at least we managed to avoid arson charges, right?</p>
<p>That's good, yeah.</p>
<p>Frank, I guess you're right.</p>
<p>The secret's bullshit, huh?</p>
<p>You try to help people and you just wind up getting screwed.</p>
