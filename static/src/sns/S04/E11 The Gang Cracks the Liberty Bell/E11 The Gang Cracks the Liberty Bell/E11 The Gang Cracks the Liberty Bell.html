<p><em>He really has an ugly face.</p>
<p>He is certainly ugly.</em></p>
<p>But, you know what, that's not really what bothers me about this.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that he looks like an old woman.</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, he is wearing a lot of blush on those cheekbones, but I feel like that was the look of the times.</p>
<p>No, no, but it's not just that though, Mac, it's not.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of presidents somehow end up looking like women.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Ronald Reagan, right?</p>
<p>Now, why would you hang a painting like this on your wall?</p>
<p>Well, it's the Historical Society, bro.</p>
<p>They have to hang it up.</p>
<p>Oh, well, we got to suffer just because some old dude who looks like Meryl Streep chopped down a cherry tree, like, ten million years ago?</p>
<p>It's just, he looks terrible!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let's take it down.</p>
<p>It's just gonna distract us through the meeting.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's get it down, man.</p>
<p>Let's take it down.</p>
<p>It's not gonna work.</p>
<p>It's just gonna distract us.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>It's bolted to the wall.</p>
<p>Well, that proves our point, man. We're not the first people to try and take that thing down.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we're gonna be the first ones to actually succeed.</p>
<p>Come on, let's tear it down, Charlie.</p>
<p>Let's just rip it off the wall, man.</p>
<p>Rip it right off the wall.</p>
<p>Whoa, guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>I got a pocketknife.</p>
<p>Just cut it out of the frame.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>'Cause I really, I've had enough of this dude.</p>
<p>Just cut it right out of the frame.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Do you want this up?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Uh, may I help you gentlemen with something?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, we're here because we want to get our bar certified as a historic landmark.</p>
<p>We want tourists to be able to come by Paddy's Pub as part of the walking tour of Philly.</p>
<p>You know, they can come by, suck up some history, do some shots, get blasted.</p>
<p>In order to be considered as a historical site, your bar would have to have some historical significance.</p>
<p>Well, trust us when we tell you that Paddy's Pub played an extremely important part in history.</p>
<p>Mm, and what, uh, part of history might that be?</p>
<p>The cracking of the Liberty Bell, of course.</p>
<p>So you're claiming that your bar had a direct role in the cracking of the Liberty Bell?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, then tell me about it.</p>
<p>Well, the year was 1412...</p>
<p>No. Really?</p>
<p>Let Dennis, let Dennis...</p>
<p>Let me tell the story, Charlie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The year was 1776.</p>
<p>And Paddy's Pub, then known, of course, as Patrick's Pub, <em>was a hotbed of revolutionary activity.</p>
<p>Revolutionaries from all over the country had come together to gather at Patrick's Pub to speak of war and revolution.</em></p>
<p>Will you look at that?</p>
<p>Sons of Liberty.</p>
<p>Patriots meeting in our bar, speaking of revolution and freedom.</p>
<p>Can you believe it, dear brother?</p>
<p>We're witnessing history in the making.</p>
<p>I do not give a shit, Deandra.</p>
<p>Now, get me a flagon of ale.</p>
<p>Get your own ale, dick.</p>
<p>You are my slave.</p>
<p>You have to get me flagons of ale.</p>
<p>I saved you from being burned at the stake for being a witch.</p>
<p>You're the one who accused me of being a witch in the first place, Dennis.</p>
<p>Well, what's done is done.</p>
<p>That's all in the past now.</p>
<p>So you can either be a slave witch in the bar, or you can be a burned up witch outside.</p>
<p>Up to you!</p>
<p>Flagon of ale now?</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, I've got some news!</p>
<p>I've got some terrible news!</p>
<p>Oh, MacDonald, how goes it?</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>You know that chick I've been banging down at Independence Hall?</p>
<p>Mm, the fat one.</p>
<p>She's not that fat.</p>
<p>Yeah, she's pretty fat, dude.</p>
<p>Good one, witch.</p>
<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p>She told me in complete confidence that a bunch of old dudes down there are drafting a declaration... a declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Wait, why would we want to be free from the British?</p>
<p>This declaration is gonna start an all-out war.</p>
<p>We have to make sure we are not on the losing side.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Okay, clearly the British are gonna win this thing.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>All right, we have to make sure that the Crown knows that we're on their side.</p>
<p>We have to make our own declaration.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, we need to make a declaration of dependence.</p>
<p>Buy a pelt here!</p>
<p>We have raccoon, we have foxes!</p>
<p>ho, there, sir.</p>
<p>Now, my good gentleman, what says you of my fine furs here?</p>
<p>Merrily I be able to guide you toward some interest in some purchase.</p>
<p>I can't understand what you're saying.</p>
<p>You want to buy a fur?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In July? No, thanks.</p>
<p>Not so fast now. That's a nice looking cart of pumpkins you got here.</p>
<p>Uh, what says you we maketh some trade, hmm?</p>
<p>All my furs for all your pumpkins.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right, aye-aye-aye-aye- aye-aye-aye-aye!</p>
<p>One pumpkin.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>All righty!</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, whoa, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.</p>
<p>We're not traders, Charlie.</p>
<p>We're thieves.</p>
<p>You want his pumpkins, we kill him and take his pumpkins.</p>
<p>This is 1776.</p>
<p>We'll get away with it!</p>
<p>I can hear you.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, very good.</p>
<p>This is how it will go down.</p>
<p>I will beat the man about the face and the neck and maybe the chest area and possibly the groin until he's no longer consisting of life pulse.</p>
<p>And then you can collect up the man's cart.</p>
<p>I shall findeth a stick.</p>
<p>Yes! Well, we'll need a stick to do the bashing.</p>
<p>Sit tight, sir.</p>
<p>Pick a stick, any stick you like.</p>
<p>All right, well, methinks the rod to be the most suitable for our purposes.</p>
<p>Ah, very nice rod.</p>
<p>Go with that rod.</p>
<p>Okey dokey dokey do.</p>
<p>Uh-oh! He's gone.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He stole our furs!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You shit head.</p>
<p>Hey, look on the bright side, Franklin.</p>
<p>We got ourselves a pumpkin.</p>
<p>This is gonna work.</p>
<p>I can't believe you dressed like that, bro.</p>
<p>Um, excuse me, this is a good plan, okay?</p>
<p>If we're gonna get this declaration into the hands of the queen, we need to dress the part.</p>
<p>It's not the way the British dress, bro.</p>
<p>They dress like this.</p>
<p>No, British commoners dress like you're dressed...</p>
<p>British peons, okay?</p>
<p>I'm dressed like a nobleman, okay?</p>
<p>These people respond to royalty.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, come on.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Just use your witch strength, slave.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not that much further. God!</p>
<p>Uh, pardon me, pardon me, good sirs.</p>
<p>But which of you gentlemen happens to be the highest ranking military officer here?</p>
<p>That would be me.</p>
<p>Cricket. Colonel Cricket.</p>
<p>What is your business, sirs?</p>
<p>Ah, well, Colonel, we are the owners of the fine local establishment Patrick's Pub.</p>
<p>Patrick's Pub!</p>
<p>Yes, of course, of course.</p>
<p>The liberty bar.</p>
<p>You harbor patriots.</p>
<p>Oh, whoops, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, myth.</p>
<p>Myth.</p>
<p>Bad intel there.</p>
<p>Yeah, bad intel.</p>
<p>Bit of a miscommunication.</p>
<p>Actually, that is why we're here.</p>
<p>Uh, we drew up this declaration.</p>
<p>We also included an illustration that we had hoped would illuminate our intentions towards the queen, huh?</p>
<p>This appears to be a rendering of... the two of you sodomizing the king whilst the queen is forced to witness.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Goodness gracious, no!</p>
<p>No, look.</p>
<p>I'm holding homeboy's arms back.</p>
<p>Dennis is ready to jam him in the face, and the queen is impressed.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a bad guy, that's not the king.</p>
<p>Uh, we're doing bad stuff to the bad...</p>
<p>Give me this.</p>
<p>You know, you don't get it.</p>
<p>Let's get the ale. The ale.</p>
<p>Wench, now, the ale, presenteth it.</p>
<p>Okay, set that down in front of him.</p>
<p>And, uh, yes, good Colonel, we present this ale to you and your men in hopes that it will fuel the British to victory.</p>
<p>Madam.</p>
<p>Whoa! Hey!</p>
<p>What the hell you doing?</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>You're making a big mess!</p>
<p>Get back to the bar!</p>
<p>I'm really sorry. That was huge!</p>
<p>Yeah. That's...</p>
<p>That hit you right in the face, didn't it?</p>
<p>You know what? We don't condone that sort of thing, okay?</p>
<p>We're going to tar and feather the shit out of her when she gets back.</p>
<p>Don't worry. Don't worry.</p>
<p>I pray you, who is that fiery wench?</p>
<p>Her? Oh, that's just my sister Deandra.</p>
<p>She's a slave.</p>
<p>Yeah. And a witch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You keep your sister as your slave?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p>So are we good here now?</p>
<p>What's the deal?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have both proven to me in the very short time that I've known you that you are both slanderous perverts lacking any semblance of moral fortitude.</p>
<p>However, I do desire to seek further counsel with the lady.</p>
<p>Uh... lady?</p>
<p>Oh, the... the witch!</p>
<p>The same girl we've just been talking about?</p>
<p>You don't really think she's a... a witch, do you?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, she's a witch.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p>Pretty sure.</p>
<p>All right, look.</p>
<p>I wish to court her in some manner, and I could use your help because I'm not, admittedly, very good with women.</p>
<p>Good with women?</p>
<p>You mean good at women?</p>
<p>Like, you can't catch them when they run away from you?</p>
<p>Bro, it's 1776.</p>
<p>They don't have any rights.</p>
<p>You can just take them and force them to do whatever you want.</p>
<p>I do not wish to take her.</p>
<p>I would like to win her favor, like a gentleman does a lady.</p>
<p>That just does not compute with me.</p>
<p>I don't understand what you're saying.</p>
<p>Digging the accent, but don't understand you.</p>
<p>Are you saying you're gay?</p>
<p>All right, escort them out!</p>
<p>Oh, no. We... we... Okay.</p>
<p>Are you going to drink the beer?</p>
<p>No, leave it. Out.</p>
<p>Just drink the beer.</p>
<p>Maybe you'll get some balls and you can take the woman.</p>
<p>Fire!</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Yes. Shoot.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Do not shoot that pumpkin!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I stole a bunch of guns!</p>
<p>I'm testing them out, Charles!</p>
<p>This revolution is going to make us a fortune!</p>
<p>All right. Well, leave the pumpkin out of it.</p>
<p>The pumpkin's innocent!</p>
<p>Shoot the pumpkin.</p>
<p>Do not shoot the pumpkin please.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Give me the gun.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Why is the witch lady shooting at you anyway?</p>
<p>Maybe she used her sorcery.</p>
<p>Sorcery?</p>
<p>Your dumb-dick partner walked into the bar and said he stole a bunch of guns and asked if I wanted to shoot a pumpkin off his head, and of course I did, so here we are.</p>
<p>Damn your necromancy, woman!</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>Maybe, if we shoot you, you won't feel it anyway, witch.</p>
<p>You know what, okay, you guys.</p>
<p>I tell you what, you win.</p>
<p>I'm a witch, okay?</p>
<p>I'm a witch!</p>
<p>And I curse both of you and all of your stupid guns.</p>
<p>Charlie, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Give me that gun.</p>
<p>She cursed the gun!</p>
<p>She cursed the gun.</p>
<p>She put a curse on the gun!</p>
<p>Let's try this one.</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>Try on me.</p>
<p>Damn those Sons of Liberty sons of bitches, Dennis.</p>
<p>Those guys are going to get us in so much trouble.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>You hang back.</p>
<p>What? Me? Why?</p>
<p>Because, dude, we need to get as much intel from these guys as we possibly can for that Colonel Cricket.</p>
<p>This fop thing is going to totally blow our cover.</p>
<p>What's going on with your mouth?</p>
<p>Oh, I got some wooden teeth put in.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, all the patriots are doing it, including Washington, which is why it makes sense, okay, if we're going undercover!</p>
<p>Not this fop bullshit!</p>
<p>No, the fop thing's good, man.</p>
<p>I got a plan with it. Yeah.</p>
<p>I got an angle.</p>
<p>Fine. Okay, listen.</p>
<p>You let me take the lead, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Fellas! How you doing?</p>
<p>A couple of flagons of ale for you!</p>
<p>So I just want to say, we love what you're doing over here.</p>
<p>I mean, taxation with representation, right?</p>
<p>So, uh... what's the buzz, huh?</p>
<p>What are we all talking about, huh?</p>
<p>Surrender, maybe?</p>
<p>We speak of revolution.</p>
<p>Revolution?</p>
<p>Revolution! That's great!</p>
<p>I'm completely on top of that!</p>
<p>Hey, fellas, who's taking the minutes here?</p>
<p>'Cause I feel like I could be an asset to you as a secretary, and...</p>
<p>Let's start by taking down all of their names.</p>
<p>First and last, please.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think this meeting is adjourned.</p>
<p>You stupid son of a bitch, dude!</p>
<p>What are you doing with the accent and the British...? Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Yeah. No, no, no.</p>
<p>I just decided to go a different way.</p>
<p>The spy thing wasn't really working.</p>
<p>Yeah? What way was that?</p>
<p>Well, your wooden teeth whistly-tooth thing? That was bad.</p>
<p>That wasn't working.</p>
<p>My teeth were a smashing success.</p>
<p>We are in dire straits here, okay?</p>
<p>We need a change of plan.</p>
<p>I think the only way we're going to convince these people that we're on their side is to become 100% British.</p>
<p>To become British?</p>
<p>We gotta commit to the fop thing.</p>
<p>That actually seems pretty sensible, Dennis.</p>
<p>No more "S's" for you.</p>
<p>It's just so cramped in here.</p>
<p>I mean, you'd think people who came here so many years before the English, that they'd build bigger houses!</p>
<p>Yeah. You'd think they'd have huge homes.</p>
<p>What is the sleeping situation in here?</p>
<p>You think this father and son are sleeping on the same bearskin together?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Where else they going to sleep?</p>
<p>What a bunch of losers!</p>
<p>I'm telling you, a bunch of inbred savages.</p>
<p>I speak English.</p>
<p>Oh, shit! For real?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, that's not good.</p>
<p>We didn't mean to...</p>
<p>Our bad.</p>
<p>Uh, just tell me.</p>
<p>How much land are you going to give away for a pumpkin these days?</p>
<p>Charlie... Charlie, listen.</p>
<p>What we need is your magical powers to lift the curses from our guns.</p>
<p>Gag-ga da boom.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>We're going to pay you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We gotta pay you.</p>
<p>We'll give you this.</p>
<p>We brought this for you.</p>
<p>Booze! Right?</p>
<p>Booze.</p>
<p>Makes you feel good.</p>
<p>Helps you sleep.</p>
<p>Brings the tribe together.</p>
<p>You want me to scalp them?</p>
<p>That young Indian was fast with the tomahawk!</p>
<p>He really lobbed a big hunk off your head up here.</p>
<p>He's going to make me look deformed!</p>
<p>Yeah. And you're going to be deformed for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Give me that skunk pelt.</p>
<p>I'll use it for hair.</p>
<p>Don't push! Don't push!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It's look cool.</p>
<p>It looks pretty good.</p>
<p>Lady Deandra?</p>
<p>Yes? Can I help you?</p>
<p>Colonel Cricket.</p>
<p>We met the other day...</p>
<p>I was the one you delivered the keg to...</p>
<p>You spit in my face.</p>
<p>Oh! Yep. Yep. There it is.</p>
<p>Indeed. Forgive my rather unadorned approach, but from the first moment I laid my eyes on you...</p>
<p>...I was smitten.</p>
<p>Perhaps my impatience has gotten the best of me, but if you will have me, I would be most honored to call you my wife.</p>
<p>A simple "no" would have sufficed.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, that one got in my mouth. That's really not cool.</p>
<p>You listen to me, you pale-faced English dickhole, you got a revolution coming.</p>
<p>And pretty soon, all of the slaves are gonna be free, and I will be owned by no man.</p>
<p>I am a fool...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...having allowed myself to imagine us back in my sprawling manor in England.</p>
<p>You on my arm, adorned in magnificent garments, dressed in the finest jewels.</p>
<p>Cricks, back it up a little bit.</p>
<p>You talking about garments and jewelry?</p>
<p>But alas, my love cannot mend our differences.</p>
<p>Oh, no-no-no, wait-wait-wait-wait!</p>
<p>Your love, your love can.</p>
<p>Your love is, your love is currently doing that, so...</p>
<p>You didn't mention anything about the sprawling manor and all the garments.</p>
<p>That was stupid.</p>
<p>But I-I thought that you just said...</p>
<p>Yeah, I did, I did, I did, but it's... your love, it's, like, filling me up with all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is!</p>
<p>Let's do this! Let's get married!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, Lady Deandra...</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>...you have made me the happiest man alive!</p>
<p>We're gonna have to work up to that, though, 'cause you are crazy ugly.</p>
<p>Keep your pants on, curly.</p>
<p>You want the slave, you gotta pay for the slave.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We're not gonna give it to you for free.</p>
<p>You gotta sweeten the pot, eh?</p>
<p>How'd you like to buy some guns?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Guns?</p>
<p>I shall buy your guns.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>I shall buy your guns!</p>
<p>No-no-no-no-no, not yet.</p>
<p>Hey, hey-hey, hey.</p>
<p>Why does he keep spitting in my mouth?</p>
<p>Who is this man?</p>
<p>Ah, hello to you, sirs, and to you, ladies.</p>
<p>These heels are almost impossible to walk in.</p>
<p>Well, get over it, dude.</p>
<p>You gotta walk in 'em, okay?</p>
<p>Now let me hear the voice.</p>
<p>No, I don't think that the voice is entirely necessary, so I'm not gonna do it.</p>
<p>If we're gonna wipe away all traces of our colonial background and blend in with British culture, we need to walk the walk and we need to talk the talk.</p>
<p>Fine. How do you do it?</p>
<p>Your voice needs to come off as elegant (with English accent): as your clothing, okay?</p>
<p>So try this.</p>
<p>Would you like a spot of tea?</p>
<p>You... "Yeeees...!"</p>
<p>Would you like a spot of tea?</p>
<p>Ye-es.</p>
<p>Draw it out more.</p>
<p>Draw it out more than that?</p>
<p>Yees...!</p>
<p>Yees...!</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Those wooden teeth are killing me.</p>
<p>That lisp is stupid.</p>
<p>I think the wooden teeth are the whole thing that's saving this thing.</p>
<p>You sound ridiculous, dude.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty good. I'm not losing the teeth. Let's just move past that.</p>
<p>Let's keep walking.</p>
<p>Okay, try it again. Try it again.</p>
<p>Yeeees...!</p>
<p>Yees...!</p>
<p>Yeees...!</p>
<p>Yees...!</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>Now, flourish the pinkie.</p>
<p>Flourish the pinkie.</p>
<p>Yees...!</p>
<p>Well, what have we got here?</p>
<p>A pair of poofs about town.</p>
<p>Sodomites in frilly lace.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>Nayeth.</p>
<p>Oh, nayeth, nayeth.</p>
<p>No, we are simply two noble Britishmen out on a stroll.</p>
<p>Good day, sir.</p>
<p>Good day. Oh!</p>
<p>Boys... get the tar.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Deandra, come and help me count my gold.</p>
<p>I'm not your slave anymore, Franklin.</p>
<p>I'm about to go live like the goddamn Queen of England and never see you two bitches again.</p>
<p>Charles, I told you the revolution pays.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but look at this, huh?</p>
<p>Guys, there is a full-fledged revolution happening outside right now!</p>
<p>It is a bloodbath!</p>
<p>We have got to do something!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Uh, let's back up and talk about what this is.</p>
<p>No, no, no, this is not important.</p>
<p>This is not important right now, okay?</p>
<p>I think it's very important.</p>
<p>There's a war happening outside and we need to...</p>
<p>We were acting like British noblemen, and then he couldn't drop the she-male thing, so we got tarred and feathered for being Sodomites!</p>
<p>It is not a she-male thing...</p>
<p>Goddamn it, we don't have time for this!</p>
<p>Help! Help me!</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Are you dying?</p>
<p>No, no, no, don't die yet! Don't die yet until you get me to your mansion.</p>
<p>No, I'm unscathed, my darling.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>This is the blood of my men.</p>
<p>We've suffered too many casualties.</p>
<p>All our guns jammed.</p>
<p>Blame that on your witch wife.</p>
<p>Let me see that.</p>
<p>Permit me to hide out here till British reinforcements arrive and massacre the entire lot of rebels.</p>
<p>Then shall we escape safely together, my darling?</p>
