<p>How are we supposed to scale back our energy costs when you're filling this generator with gasoline?</p>
<p>Yeah, gross. Since when did you start running the bar on a gas generator?</p>
<p>About a week ago. I've been doing it for about a week.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Well, because, you know, electricity's so expensive, man.</p>
<p>So I figured let's get a generator and, you know, run the bar on it.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Gasoline's, like, a thousand times more expensive than electricity.</p>
<p>And you know what, Charlie? You shouldn't be making these decisions anyway, okay?</p>
<p>You're not the decision-making type.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>As the brains of this organization, I should've made this decision.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, since when did you become the brains.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I've always been the brains.</p>
<p>What are your talking about?</p>
<p>What the hell am I?</p>
<p>You're the looks. - Yeah, of course I'm the looks but I was seeing myself as the brains and the looks.</p>
<p>No, you're the looks, I'm the brains, Charlie's the wild card.</p>
<p>Oh! That's awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah! Yeah, that's the classic setup.</p>
<p>You know this? No?</p>
<p>Look, every great crew in history has followed that basic dynamic, right?</p>
<p>Looks, brains, wild card.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>The A-Team did it.</p>
<p>Scooby Doo did it.</p>
<p>The Ghost busters did it.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Yes! Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we don't stick to that basic format, and it gets us into trouble.</p>
<p>So what you're saying is that by breaking from that format, we're actually limiting our ability to be as successful as those organizations.</p>
<p>Totally right, dude.</p>
<p>Great. On to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>We're getting plowed in the ass by the oil companies and the gas companies with their ten-gallon hats and their rotten, ass-plowing hearts.</p>
<p>So, as the brains of this organization, I came up with a plan.</p>
<p>Lay it on us, bud.</p>
<p>It involves pulling up our bootstraps, oiling up a couple of asses and doing a little plowing of our own.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>Not gay sex.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, 'cause that's what it sounded like.</p>
<p>What did you mean?</p>
<p>We're going to solve the gas cris.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Its always sunny in philadelphia 402</p>
<p>"The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis"</p>
<p>Charlie, the plan is simple, okay?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We go to a bank, we talk to a loan officer.</p>
<p>We get a hefty loan to buy a bunch of gasoline.</p>
<p>We take that gasoline, we store it in the basement, we wait a few months.</p>
<p>When the gas prices skyrocket, we sell it, make a huge profit.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, if the guy doesn't seem like he's going for it, I'll show him this, uh, big-breasted women chart... and that'll win him over.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure it will.</p>
<p>I mean, 'cause that's great and the plan's actually pretty great.</p>
<p>The problem I'm having with it is that I don't have anything to do.</p>
<p>No, you do have something to do.</p>
<p>You're the wild card.</p>
<p>You sit there looking crazy and capable of anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you set the tone for the whole meeting.</p>
<p>So if I'm, like, there while you guys are talking and I'm just, like, like...</p>
<p>That's terrible.</p>
<p>That was my... that was my wild card face, all right...</p>
<p>What message are you trying to send with that?</p>
<p>Really? Was that not a good one?</p>
<p>Well, so what if it's more like, like...</p>
<p>And you want him to think that you're going to take a dump or...?</p>
<p>Seriously, that's what that looks like?</p>
<p>I just don't know what message you're trying to...</p>
<p>Oh, man, you're forcing it.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You know what?</p>
<p>Yeah, you're really forcing it.</p>
<p>I'd better look in a mirror 'cause I don't know what I'm doing and what it looks like feel like two different things.</p>
<p>The Brains, I'm going to supervise 'cause there is no way he should be making this decision.</p>
<p>Well, walk me through it, dude, 'cause I just don't see what you're talking about.</p>
<p>It's not a rape van. It's a spy van.</p>
<p>No, it looks very much like a van rape to me, but whatever.</p>
<p>Dennis, you gotta look at this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Bruce Mathis is about to give away all of Mom's money.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>In two days, some Muslim Cultural Center is about to get a giant check made out of our cash, and we've got to get that back.</p>
<p>Listen, this jamoke is giving our money to terrorists, and we've got to prove it.</p>
<p>Dee, Mom gave all of our money to Bruce.</p>
<p>You were never going to get it anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, no-no-no, I was.</p>
<p>See, I had a plan.</p>
<p>I was going to eliminate everybody else and be the only surviving heir, so... help.</p>
<p>So when you say "eliminate," you mean you were going to kill me?</p>
<p>I don't know. No, yes, maybe I was going to; Maybe I wasn't. The point is moot now.</p>
<p>So can you please help me out here?</p>
<p>So you were planning on killing me?</p>
<p>Stop arguing. Are you going to help us out? We got no time here.</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>"Pass"?</p>
<p>Yeah, pass.</p>
<p>Super-pass, berpass...</p>
<p>How do you super-pass on something like this...</p>
<p>I pass! I pass! Because you were planning on killing me.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I feel like you're really focused on one tiny part of what I'm trying to talk about here.</p>
<p>It's a very big part of your...</p>
<p>It's just a couple of words.</p>
<p>Go away. I'm trying to draw breasts and pretty women.</p>
<p>Focus on the words "money" and "Bruce" and "me" and "help."</p>
<p>All right, and what is the reason you're requesting a loan today?</p>
<p>Wait for it...</p>
<p>Gasoline.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Don't rush me.</p>
<p>Don't rush him.</p>
<p>Thank you, I feel rushed.</p>
<p>Look, here's the plan.</p>
<p>You give us a shitload of money.</p>
<p>We buy a shitload of gasoline.</p>
<p>We wait 12 months, we sell the gasoline and make a shitload of profit.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we tend to give loans to businesses, not...</p>
<p>She's not getting it. Get the graph.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, the graph.</p>
<p>We have a graph.</p>
<p>Yeah, check this out.</p>
<p>Now these are the gas prices last year.</p>
<p>These are the gas prices this year.</p>
<p>And this is what the gas prices will be.</p>
<p>And what are those?</p>
<p>These are gorgeous women with heaving breasts.</p>
<p>Yeah. Why?</p>
<p>Well, to be perfectly honest, we sort of thought we'd be speaking to a man today, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, is there any way that we can talk to your boss because I think he would understand more better?</p>
<p>My boss is a woman.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Your boss is a woman?</p>
<p>Now, this is a strange bank.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I am definitely rejecting your request for $300,000 to buy... gasoline.</p>
<p>Dennis, you're on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know... I just had a crazy thought.</p>
<p>How's about I take you in the back and "change" your mind?</p>
<p>Or how about we all go in the back and have great sex?</p>
<p>What are you doing, hmm?</p>
<p>I'm pulling a wild card here, man, so...</p>
<p>No, dude, just let Dennis do his thing, okay?</p>
<p>I can be very sensual with a woman, all right? You will enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now is not the right time to pull the wild card, okay?</p>
<p>Let me do my thing.</p>
<p>Let me do the seducing.</p>
<p>Let Dennis bang her so we can get our loan.</p>
<p>Well, here's a scenario.</p>
<p>What if she wanted to bang me or you for that matter?</p>
<p>You can't pull the wild card when I already have my shirt off, that should be a rule.</p>
<p>Can that be a rule?</p>
<p>Yes, that's a rule.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?! Back off!</p>
<p>Come on, man, let me do it. This is my job!</p>
<p>Wild card, baby!</p>
<p>Dude, I feel like I can do it then, too.</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>Goddamn it, look, okay, so...</p>
<p>Why don't you decide?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which one of us do you want to take you in the back and bang you?</p>
<p>My intel tells me that Bruce moved into this crappy apartment complex.</p>
<p>Where'd you get your intel?</p>
<p>I water boarded some guy.</p>
<p>Told me everything.</p>
<p>You tortured somebody?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Big time.</p>
<p>What do you see?</p>
<p>I can't see shit. Why would you tint the inside of the windows?</p>
<p>I don't want anybody to see in.</p>
<p>We can't see out, Frank!</p>
<p>I might've overdone it a little bit.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>That's Bruce!</p>
<p>This guy?</p>
<p>That's the guy, walking there! Walking there!</p>
<p>Start the car. Let's go! Let's follow him!</p>
<p>Are you sure that's him?</p>
<p>Gonna take some pictures.</p>
<p>I got it working.</p>
<p>Go! Go!</p>
<p>All right, there's... the gas pedal's stuck or something.</p>
<p>Well, wobble it.</p>
<p>"Wobble it"?</p>
<p>Yeah, wobble it back and forth.</p>
<p>Wiggle it. Wiggle it. That's it. That's it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now, hit it. Oh, God...</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>Give me whiplash? You're blinding me.</p>
<p>Will you calm down? Hold on.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Hey, assholes.</p>
<p>Hey, what the hell was that about?!</p>
<p>I can't believe Dee keeps her life savings in her sock drawer.</p>
<p>That's a dumb place to hide it.</p>
<p>She's an investor now.</p>
<p>She'll thank us later.</p>
<p>You know what, guys?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I got to bring something up.</p>
<p>Can I bring something up? 'Cause if it don't, it's going to stew up inside me.</p>
<p>It's going to drive me crazy.</p>
<p>What's up, man?</p>
<p>I kind of can't believe that you guys took your shirts off back there, man.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like you really sold me down the river.</p>
<p>The Ghostbusters would never do something like that to each other.</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys did it, man.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>No trash cans, only cars.</p>
<p>Whoa, cool your jets, guy.</p>
<p>We paid for this gas.</p>
<p>It's going to be a while, so...</p>
<p>Stop now. You can't do this.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Only cars.</p>
<p>Oh, geez. All right, Wild Card, do your thing.</p>
<p>So help me God, I'll blow this place to kingdom come.</p>
<p>Not that, not that. Jesus Christ, Charlie.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>No, we just got to figure out a way to get this gas back to the bar without using the barrels.</p>
<p>Well, how the hell we gonna do that?</p>
<p>All right, barrel number six is done, dudes.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be the best...</p>
<p>No. Guys, this is not working, okay?</p>
<p>We're actually losing money driving back and forth from that gas station all day long.</p>
<p>You're burning up our product.</p>
<p>Plus I have swallowed a good deal of it.</p>
<p>It's just a damn waste.</p>
<p>Yeah, and gas has gone up seven cents since this morning.</p>
<p>He puts a new thing on the sign every time we pull in there.</p>
<p>We're screwing ourselves here, guys.</p>
<p>Hold on, let's not freak out.</p>
<p>Let's not freak out.</p>
<p>The plan's not working though, man.</p>
<p>We just need to adjust our business model to meet the needs of a changing market place. That's all.</p>
<p>That's money talk. Let's talk money.</p>
<p>We got to make some money in the short term.</p>
<p>Well, how the hell are we going to do that?</p>
<p>I got a plan.</p>
<p>We'd like to return some gas, please.</p>
<p>Yeah. Don't worry, bro, got receipts.</p>
<p>I can't do that.</p>
<p>You can't do it or you won't do it?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Not yet, buddy.</p>
<p>Okay, bro, want to play hard ball, fine.</p>
<p>You're about to experience the hard knocks of a free market, bitch.</p>
<p>Get ready to feel it where it hurts.</p>
<p>Your dick.</p>
<p>No, no, not his dick. His wallet.</p>
<p>Your wallet.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Here we are. This is it.</p>
<p>Are you sure this is the place?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, my intel says so.</p>
<p>Okay, take these box cutters, put them in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Take this fertilizer, toss it in the closet.</p>
<p>What the hell are we doing that for?</p>
<p>'Cause when I call the cops on him, they'll come and find all this bomb-making shit and they'll arrest his money-stealing ass.</p>
<p>We don't want to call the cops.</p>
<p>They'll find the bug I'm going to plant.</p>
<p>That's a baby monitor, Frank.</p>
<p>You're planting a baby monitor?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>A lot of people are bugging their babies these days.</p>
<p>I guess babies can't be trusted.</p>
<p>What exactly is it you're expecting to find here?</p>
<p>Lotta shady shit.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like maybe Bruce is banging dudes.</p>
<p>Why would that be shady?</p>
<p>Maybe the dudes are babies.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Bruce is not banging any baby dudes.</p>
<p>Look, we're going back to the original plan, okay?</p>
<p>We're going to put the frame on him.</p>
<p>We're going to be heroes among the community and I'm going to get all of my money back as a reward.</p>
<p>All my money.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>It was probably going to end up mine eventually, so...</p>
<p>Okay, there's something I want to talk to you about.</p>
<p>Were you planning on offing me and then offing Dennis also?</p>
<p>Frank, we are in the middle of something.</p>
<p>I don't have time to chitchat with you about stuff.</p>
<p>Were you planning on offing me?</p>
<p>I didn't say that.</p>
<p>You didn't deny it either.</p>
<p>Deny it?</p>
<p>Do I have to deny... something so craz...</p>
<p>Give me the baby monitor.</p>
<p>I'll hide it for you.</p>
<p>Capitalism at work.</p>
<p>This ought to show the son of a bitch.</p>
<p>All right, buddy, now explain to me how exactly we're going to calculate the totals.</p>
<p>Oh, it's easy, dude.</p>
<p>You pour gas into the car using one of these funnels, right?</p>
<p>And I count how much gas is going into the car.</p>
<p>All right, let me just stop you right there.</p>
<p>How exactly are you planning on counting a liquid?</p>
<p>I know how to count, dude.</p>
<p>Okay, you do it, you do it, Mac, because I can't speak to him.</p>
<p>Free Market 101, you got to have customers to have a working business, right?</p>
<p>So we've got to attract attention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I, for one, suggest me blowing fireballs to get that attention.</p>
<p>Fireballs?</p>
<p>Where is that coming from?</p>
<p>No, rifling fireballs around...</p>
<p>No, people will see it from the street and pull in.</p>
<p>They'll want to buy the gas.</p>
<p>We have ten containers of gasoline.</p>
<p>Charlie, the lighter, please.</p>
<p>What the hell... No, no, no.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate my strong opposition to this idea.</p>
<p>Trust me, Dennis, I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>This is really unsafe, dude.</p>
<p>Do not blow that fireball...</p>
<p>Wow. Okay, wow, I take back everything I just said.</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, I'm doing one of those, baby.</p>
<p>You can do it bigger?</p>
<p>No, Charlie, let me...</p>
<p>Make sure it's bigger.</p>
<p>Wait...</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>You burned my head!</p>
<p>Oh, I did. I burned him.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Easy, camper, easy, camper.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ! How can I relax?</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>OK, OK?</p>
<p>Just stop. Just stop.</p>
<p>Do you have anything other than a towel and duct tape?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>New plan... we're going to a hospital.</p>
<p>You know what, bro, actually we're going to be done with your plans for a little while. 'Cause the system you set up, it ain't working.</p>
<p>So I got a new system.</p>
<p>Me... both the brains and the looks.</p>
<p>Charlie, you're still going to be the wild card 'cause that fireball you blew was badass.</p>
<p>It was great, right?</p>
<p>You just kind of got in the way.</p>
<p>Mac, check this out though.</p>
<p>You're going to be the muscle.</p>
<p>No, I...</p>
<p>I think we've got to stick to the paradigm that we set up.</p>
<p>The A-Team...</p>
<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p>Your paragon is failing us, man.</p>
<p>It's a paradigm, but yeah.</p>
<p>It wasn't working.</p>
<p>It's not working.</p>
<p>What happened was, we confused your bossiness with braininess, and those two are very different things.</p>
<p>That is what happened.</p>
<p>So, check it out.</p>
<p>Man, I got a new plan.</p>
<p>This is what we're going to do, okay, baby?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're going to steal Frank's rape van because driving around with all that gasoline is ruing the interior of my car, and I just... I won't have it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Then we're going to take that van, and we're going to offer people something that gas stations just can't offer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Gasoline directly to their doorsteps.</p>
<p>Door-to-door gasoline salesmen.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that's amazing.</p>
<p>That's a brilliant plan, right?</p>
<p>All right, whatever, fine.</p>
<p>Then I'll be the muscle. I'll muscle these pricks into buying the gas.</p>
<p>Ooh, actually why don't you muscle you way back by the van, because you look like a burned-up freak.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>A look is going to be a big part of this.</p>
<p>I'm going to get some disguises.</p>
<p>Why would we need disguises, Charlie?</p>
<p>So people don't know who we are, you know.</p>
<p>They already don't know who we are.</p>
<p>You're not letting the wild card do his thing.</p>
<p>Is there any reason behind what you're doing?</p>
<p>Wild card.</p>
<p>Stewart's up on his second shot on the fairway, hole 15.</p>
<p>I'd say it's about 195 yards.</p>
<p>He has a seven iron.</p>
<p>I mean, how has he been sitting there watching golf for three hours?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Is that a baby monitor?</p>
<p>Oh, cut it off!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Now he's suspicious of us!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>You are such a bad hider.</p>
<p>I'm a bad hider?</p>
<p>You-you never could hide.</p>
<p>I bet you still hide your money in your sock drawer.</p>
<p>My sock drawer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on. That would be stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do.</p>
<p>Just shut up.</p>
<p>You're lying to me.</p>
<p>I'm not lying to you.</p>
<p>I'm getting out of here. This is a setup.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're setting me up, and I'm getting the hell out.</p>
<p>Frank, get back here.</p>
<p>You're not gonna do this to me, girl.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>I understand what's going on.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Okay, they're on the move.</p>
<p>Hey. Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I know what's going on.</p>
<p>You think I was born yesterday?</p>
<p>Okay, go, go, go, Matt, go.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, don't-don't lie to me.</p>
<p>I have my ways of finding out things.</p>
<p>You're be, you're be so...</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Is that a Muslim guy?</p>
<p>He's getting in my van.</p>
<p>Come on, dude, seriously?</p>
<p>All right, well, just let me do the talking.</p>
<p>Well, I feel like you got to at least talk with a Southern accent, man.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna talk in a Southern accent.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that you wore this stupid disguise.</p>
<p>But we're oil men.</p>
<p>We would have Southern accents.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we don't need bolo ties and stupid hats.</p>
<p>Yes, you do.</p>
<p>She's gonna think, uh...</p>
<p>Hello, ma'am.</p>
<p>Well, what a lovely housedress.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you're looking all sorts of good.</p>
<p>Now, you seem like a sweet, sophisticated, nice, busy, young lady, so we're not gonna waste your time today.</p>
<p>Nah. We're just a couple oil men in from Dallas, and, well, we're itching like a hound to give you a-something you want.</p>
<p>What my associate is trying to say is that we're here to offer your community a much-needed service...</p>
<p>Hells, yeah! We want to feel you up, if'n you were so inclined as to let us.</p>
<p>Please, let me do the talking.</p>
<p>Please, let me...</p>
<p>Now, we ain't gonna take no for an answer now, you hear? Okay?</p>
<p>So don't be making me sic my associate on you here, all right?</p>
<p>He don't take kindly to "no."</p>
<p>So, can I feel you up or what?</p>
<p>Yep, you best get to stepping, because Johnny Law's a-coming.</p>
<p>You might want to start driving because she called the cops on us.</p>
<p>Why's he talking like that?</p>
<p>Well, wild card over here decided to lose his mind.</p>
<p>I say, I say, that's just damn preposterous, boy.</p>
<p>Well, now you're just talking like Foghorn Leghorn!</p>
<p>All right, guys, I think it's time we cut our losses and go back to the original plan.</p>
<p>Ah, the generator.</p>
<p>No, not the generator.</p>
<p>Storing the gas and patties.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay? It's too soon to sell this gas anyway, so shut the door.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>All right, admit it, that Muslim guy was gonna rub me out, and that's when you jumped out of the van after I got out!</p>
<p>Admit it, come on!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I don't know what you're talking about!</p>
<p>Oh, don't lie to me!</p>
<p>Come on, admit it!</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I admit it!</p>
<p>What do you admit?!</p>
<p>I admit anything you want to hear!</p>
<p>Now, you admit that Bruce Mathis is a terrorist...</p>
<p>He's a terrorist!</p>
<p>And that you are working for him!</p>
<p>Yes, I work for him. We get our information from the top, the top cave.</p>
<p>Don't bullshit me!</p>
<p>That's all I got to say!</p>
<p>Like what I'm seeing here, Frank. Bring me up to speed.</p>
<p>I'm waterboarding your sister because she's escalating the plot to kill us.</p>
<p>Dennis, help me!</p>
<p>Why the hell would I help you, Dee?</p>
<p>You're still plotting to kill me.</p>
<p>No! Help!</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>Yeah, shut up.</p>
<p>Tell me what's going on!</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, by the way, we borrowed that pathetic rape van of yours; you got to get that gas pedal fixed, man.</p>
<p>Mac rammed into some dude's car, like, five times. It was amazing.</p>
<p>You guys took the van?</p>
<p>I thought it was some Muslim guy.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>What is going on in here?</p>
<p>Frank's waterboarding Dee.</p>
<p>You guys?! You took the van?!</p>
<p>Well, hell, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I just realized something.</p>
<p>Frank is the muscle.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The reason that shit hasn't been working out for us is because we are not working with our full crew.</p>
<p>I'm the brains, you're the looks, Charlie's the wild card, and Frank is the muscle.</p>
<p>Well, what's Dee?</p>
<p>She's the useless chick.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>You see? We complete it!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>We all complete the team!</p>
<p>Now, if we stick together, guys, we can do anything.</p>
<p>Now, question: Frank, does that waterboard really work?</p>
<p>You bet your ass!</p>
<p>I got Dee to admit to things she never did!</p>
<p>Well, then it works.</p>
<p>All right, then, gentlemen, I got a new plan.</p>
<p>Bruce's, we slip in and we grab him.</p>
<p>Shouldn't you guys have gotten these barrels out of the van before we got in?</p>
<p>They're really heavy, Dee.</p>
<p>We've already had to do it, like, a million times.</p>
<p>Where'd you get the money for this gas?</p>
<p>Dee, will you shut up and let me continue?</p>
<p>Now, Frank, when we get back to the bar, you waterboard the shit out of Bruce and get a confession.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, you take that confession to the police, use your charm and good looks, and get that reward money.</p>
<p>Done and done.</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, you continue to be useless.</p>
<p>Charlie and I will use that reward money to pay off our electricity bill.</p>
<p>Then we'll probably buy some more gasoline 'cause I feel like that's a great plan.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Brakes don't... Brakes don't work.</p>
<p>The gas pedal.</p>
<p>No, I'm saying, no, the brakes!</p>
<p>Wiggle the gas pedal.</p>
<p>Guys, why aren't the brakes working?</p>
<p>Because I cut the brakes!</p>
<p>Wild card, bitches!</p>
<p>What?! Charlie!</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, guys, I can't stop this van!</p>
<p>Seriously?!</p>
<p>Abort! Abort!</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Mastersfield steps up to the tee, eight strokes behind the leader.</p>
<p>Hole number 17, 338 yards, dogleg left.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>What the hell, man?!</p>
<p>Ah, my van.</p>
<p>Why is someone trying to ruin my life?!</p>
<p>I didn't do anything to anybody, man!</p>
<p>I love that car!</p>
<p>That's, uh, that's not Bruce, is it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If there's something strange.</p>
<p>In your neighborhood Who you gonna call?</p>
<p>Ghostbusters!</p>
