<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I mean, I have a boyfriend. Is it that hard to believe? I got a boyfriend.</p>
<p>His name's Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: How the hell did you get a boyfriend?</p>
<p>I met him on Bunchers.</p>
<p>Right, right, so you went on a group date with a bunch of ugly chicks to make yourself look good, and you tricked a guy.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, that's exactly what I did, and it worked well, and-and now we're going steady.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: That's a good trick.</p>
<p>Bunchers-- sounds like the '70s.</p>
<p>Bunch of people would get together.</p>
<p>The next thing you know, it was all asses and hands and tits and... I could slip right in and out without anybody noticing. It was great.</p>
<p>I can definitely brush up on my game.</p>
<p>I don't know if you guys noticed this, but, like, I'm kind of having a hard time closing the deal with the waitress.</p>
<p>Is he...?</p>
<p>Yeah, we've noticed.</p>
<p>So, maybe I can go on, like, some group dates with you, and you can show me some skills, and I can figure out the final move that I need to, you know...</p>
<p>Oh, and let's do 'em at Paddy's.</p>
<p>We could make a bunch of money. It's a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: That's a great idea. We can make a bunch of money.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. As an erotic man, I have been keeping my eye on this buncher situation, and I got to say--</p>
<p>I'm into it. So, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>I will take you two under my wing, and show you the DENNIS system in action.</p>

<p>Ah... Focus up, guys. Come on. The girls are gonna be here soon, geez.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Why do you have a dog leash?</p>
<p>Oh. Good question. Yeah. It's for the first "D" in the DENNIS system. See, the girls will see the leash, and I'll say, "I've got a rescue dog outside," thereby, "D," demonstrating my value as a compassionate man.</p>
<p>Later, when we go outside, the dog will be missing.</p>
<p>I'll become hysterical and suggest that, maybe, the dog ran back to the apartment. Then we will go back to the apartment. The dog won't be there, either, and the girl will console me. With sex.</p>
<p>(laughing) Oh!</p>
<p>What happened to the dog?</p>
<p>He let it go.</p>
<p>It probably got obliterated by a taxi or something.</p>
<p>Ah, I bet that's what happened.</p>
<p>shit, poor thing. No, no, no, no, no.</p>

<p>No, I'm not proposing, I'm promising my fidelity in our new relationship. I deactivated my Bunchers account and I changed my Facebook status to "In a Relationship."</p>

<p>God, are you proposing?</p>
<p>No. No, no.</p>
<p>No. I'm not proposing.</p>
<p>I would never, uh...</p>
<p>(laughs) No, this is, um, it's a promise ring. Oh.</p>
<p>So, from now on, Waitress...</p>
<p>I promise to be nice and true.</p>
<p>I have a name.</p>
<p>Do you want the ring or not?</p>
<p>I do, yes. Thank you.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And in return, of course, I would ask that you promise something to me.</p>
<p>To be your girlfriend.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Stop, okay?</p>
<p>Do-Don't do that.</p>
<p>I just need you to give me a good rating on an Internet Web site.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Yeah, sure. I can...</p>
<p>Yeah? Yeah.</p>
<p>That would mean so much to me. It really would.</p>
<p>Okay. I, um...</p>
<p>I don't have online, though.</p>
<p>What does that me...?</p>
<p>You "don't have online"?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What the hell does that...?</p>
<p>Just... you can just go on your phone and do it on your phone.</p>
<p>My phone is, it's so old!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That phone is preposterous!</p>
<p>How long have you had that?</p>
<p>Nine... 90...</p>
<p>90...?!</p>
<p>How do you get on the Internet?</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't do, like, the e-mails...</p>
<p>"The e-mails"? It's e-mail.</p>
<p>It's just e-mail.</p>
<p>Who doesn't have the Internet in this day and age?</p>
<p>What am I doing?</p>
<p>Why am I lowering myself to this?</p>
<p>I don't need your approval.</p>
<p>Goddamn.</p>
<p>I don't need anyone's approval.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>What are you doing, huh?</p>
<p>You rating me right now?</p>
<p>Well, guess what.</p>
<p>Go ahead, rate me!</p>
<p>'Cause I'll rate you, huh?!</p>
<p>Go ahead, rate me!</p>
<p>I don't give a shit!</p>
<p>Rate me... I'll rate you!</p>
<p>Zero, zero, zero rate!</p>
<p>Okay, sir...</p>
<p>Rate, rate!</p>
<p>Sir, you need to leave, okay?</p>
<p>Rate, rate!</p>
<p>You need to leave, okay?</p>
<p>Zero, zero!</p>
<p>I will rate every single woman in this restaurant!</p>
<p>So, he had the mule...</p>
<p>But he forgot the water.</p>
<p>Then the guy looks up and he says, "Wait a second.</p>
<p>Where am I... in Ohio?!"</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>You guys are so funny.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Can-can you give us a second?</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>What the...? We've never got this far! These girls are ready to bang.</p>
<p>All right, well, what do we say? What do we do?</p>
<p>We-we're gonna have to go off script.</p>
<p>No, no, Frank, blow the whistle! Call it, call it...</p>
<p>We got to bail...</p>
<p>What are you kidding me?!</p>
<p>Are you crazy?!</p>
<p>We've come too far to call it!</p>
<p>Uh, my stomach's killing me.</p>
<p>Should we talk about that?</p>
<p>No, no...</p>
<p>I got the shits, I do have the shits...</p>
<p>No, no, no! Not good!</p>
<p>Try another joke, quick!</p>
<p>Another joke?</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ladies, got another one for you. There's this dago fisherman...</p>
<p>Oh, shit! What? No...</p>
<p>No, no, Charlie... Charlie, we got it, we got...</p>
<p>Oh, shit! There goes my cock ring!</p>
<p>His cock ring fell!</p>
<p>Yeah, I got the power, girls.</p>
<p>Yeah, you think you can rate me?</p>
<p>Bullshit! Rate-- zero!</p>
<p>Zero! Zero rating!</p>
<p>Zero rating! Ha-ha!</p>
<p>Yeah, I got the power!</p>
<p>How does it feel, ladies?</p>
<p>I don't give a shit. Yeah!</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>You know what? I want every single lady in here out of here!</p>
<p>Where-where-where are all, are all the ladies?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, you know, the crowd's kind of been thinning out.</p>
<p>I think it's because we haven't really been tending bar.</p>
<p>Well, there's still a bunch of dudes here.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a bunch of dudes here 'cause I'm crushing it. They're all here to get Deed-- the most empowered woman in Philly. They all do seem to be into her. Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>You again? Listen.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna change your rating, okay?</p>
<p>Just be grateful for the time that we had together and beat it.</p>
<p>Actually I was hoping to hang out again.</p>
<p>Yeah? I bet you do.</p>
<p>It's 'cause I gave you one star-- I played you.</p>
<p>I don't need stars.</p>
<p>I was just hoping to get laid again.</p>
<p>What? Hey, Dee, any chance I could get Deed again? No, you're upset.</p>
<p>Aren't you upset?</p>
<p>You're upset about the zero rating I gave you.</p>
<p>No. You could rate me lower if you like.</p>
<p>Hey, are you the whore who bangs everybody?</p>
<p>No, I'm not the whore...</p>
<p>I-I'm the empowered woman who gives poor ratings to men.</p>
<p>Sure. Can I get a rating?</p>
<p>No! Why would you want that from me? What's going on?</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>All three of you!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, guys, go ahead.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go. Go.</p>
<p>I understand. Okay, I think I know what's happening here. Guys?</p>
<p>We've lost sight of what's truly important.</p>
<p>You can't derive your self-worth from the opinions of others.</p>
<p>No! No, you get your self-worth from when you convince yourself that your tough and that you're straight.</p>
<p>I am tough.</p>
<p>Sure, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Or-or that you have got a shot with a woman who we've all banged, but who hates you.</p>
<p>Right. You're saying that I'm getting closer.</p>
<p>Nice. I got a shot.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're getting close, buddy. You'll get there.</p>
<p>Or you-- that your penis could ever possibly remain erect for more than a couple of seconds, even with a cock ring on.</p>
<p>Hmm. Or that you are a powerful woman... instead of a dirty, dirty whore... who bangs toad people.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>Your true power comes not from outside sources, but from the delusional stories that you all convince yourselves of.</p>
<p>And no one, no one can take that away from you.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And what about you?</p>
<p>Me? What about me?</p>
<p>I'm good, man.</p>
<p>I-I've been doing great.</p>
<p>Yeah, this whole thing's been great for me.</p>
<p>Well, that's good because you're down to zero stars.</p>
<p>Oh, is he?</p>
<p>Yeah, down to zero.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit about that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>The star rating thing is not...</p>
<p>(stammers)</p>
<p>Can I see that for a second?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me see that, yeah.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Yeah, you know... Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! You son of a bitch!</p>
