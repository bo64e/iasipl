<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Charlie, you know, the main problem with people going to these state-run loony bins is the separation between church and state.</p>
<p>Explain.</p>
<p>Well, you spend most of your time talking to a therapist, instead of a priest.</p>
<p>You know, a priest is gonna let you off the hook for all the things that you've done.</p>
<p>You heard Pete, he feels guilty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He needs to be absolved, so that he can go psycho again.</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I gue... I guess I see that.</p>
<p>Look, dude, I feel guilty all the time for my thoughts and urges, you know, but I'm not gonna talk to a therapist, who's gonna make me, you know, deal with it and confront those issues.</p>
<p>I talk to a priest, he lets me off the hook, I move on.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>

<p>Why would I want you to...?</p>
<p>No, no, what? No.</p>
<p>Dude, that's it.</p>
<p>Just hear the confession.</p>
<p>All right, yeah, but if he wants up inside me, it will cost you a whole sixer, I mean, that... I got my dignity.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(groans): Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me get one of those other beers, too.</p>

<p>Come on. How much do these vultures need?</p>

<p>Holy water-- we got that.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got all the stuff.</p>
<p>We got the straps. We got everything, man.</p>
<p>Okay. So, what's the plan?</p>
<p>We're just gonna, like, bum-rush this guy from behind or what?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, guys, come on.</p>
<p>No one is taking me from behind, all right?</p>
<p>Unless you have crack.</p>
<p>If you have crack, let's boogie.</p>
<p>No one is going into your asshole.</p>
<p>I wouldn't let them without the crack.</p>
<p>Can we just...?</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go through the basic beats, all right?</p>
<p>Uh, talk a bunch of Latin.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>I'll fake it.</p>
<p>Wait, what do you mean you'll fake it?</p>
<p>You don't, you don't know your Latin anymore...?</p>
<p>No, no. Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I can sell anything, you know?</p>
<p>You know how many times I fake on the streets?</p>
<p>You know? You have to fake.</p>
<p>The guys that don't fake, they're the ones that get it the worst.</p>
<p>Cricket, just like anything we can do to have you not talk about, like, sucking penises or getting raped in the butt...</p>
<p>It just keeps popping up.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, I got it. Problem solved.</p>
<p>I got Pete's drug.</p>
<p>Oh, we got drug?</p>
<p>All right, crank me up, baby!</p>
<p>We going up? Down? How we doing this, huh?</p>
<p>What the hell is Crick...?</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Uh-oh! Cricket! (groans)</p>
<p>Oh, the face? Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ! That is gross, man! What the hell?!</p>
<p>God's wrath.</p>
<p>He had some sort of, like, Thanksgiving incident.</p>
<p>He went to some, like, party...</p>
<p>Yeah, at your house!</p>
<p>Everyone was there!</p>
<p>How do you not remember this?</p>
<p>I don't have a house!</p>
<p>No, you were not at our place 'cause we would not have invited you to our Thanksgiving thing.</p>
<p>No. That's awful.</p>
<p>Never mind. Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>How the hell did you get drug for Pete?</p>
<p>Well, I had a simple conversation with a reasonable man and that man wrote me a prescription.</p>
<p>Mm, yeah. He got the drug by being a real-life actual psychopath.</p>
<p>(chuckles) She keeps... Uh, no... ridiculous, okay?</p>
<p>No, the man asked me a few questions.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I answered those questions as honestly as I could.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Next thing I know I'm walking out the door with meds for borderline personality disorder.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>You see? That's how you get shit done, Dee.</p>
<p>No, no. That's how you get diagnosed.</p>
<p>Where is he? Where's Pete?</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna put him out of his misery!</p>
<p>No, no! Frank, Frank! We're gonna help this guy, all right?</p>
<p>But there's no helping him, Dennis-- don't you understand?</p>
<p>I know. I'm the frog kid, right?</p>
<p>It was all in my mind, but I got cured.</p>
<p>But I could have another episode.</p>
<p>So if I had another episode, what do I do?</p>
<p>I eat a couple of flies.</p>
<p>If he has another episode, he kills us. He's a murderer!</p>
<p>Uh... Dude, dude!</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm-I'm not a murderer.</p>
<p>That's just what a murderer would say.</p>
<p>No, no, no, really. All that stuff with my family?</p>
<p>It's just, it's just a rumor people started about me.</p>
<p>You know, kind of like all the rumors you guys started about me?</p>
<p>What rumors? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know, that I'm crazy and stuff.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, uh, crazy awesome, you know... Like crazy bad-ass!</p>
<p>Yeah, except-except none of it was true, and then the more people spread it around, the more afraid people were of me.</p>
<p>Well, wait a second.</p>
<p>Then why did you get sent to a mental institution?</p>
<p>Social anxiety disorder mixed with depression.</p>
<p>I was really more of a danger to myself.</p>
<p>I was always talking about committing suicide.</p>
<p>(Dennis and Charlie groan)</p>
<p>That's why I wanted to reconnect with you guys 'cause, you know, a lot of people they can't deal with that kind of stuff, but you always liked me, so I figured you guys could help me cope with it.</p>
<p>That we would help...?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we could help you cope with it. Um... Or... Hmm?</p>

<p>Okay, Pete! This thing's going all the way to Los Angeles, buddy, all right?</p>
