<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>These are going down<em> real</em> smooth now.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Dee, slow down. You're on pace to drink 130 beers.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Don't ruin this for me, Deandra. This could be the last chance I got to do something great in my life.</p>
<p>You jerks are just all mad 'cause I'm gonna be the one to shatter Boss Hogg's drinking record.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Dee, Boss Hogg was a big, fat redneck from<em> The Dukes of Hazzard.</em> Wade Boggs is a Hall of Fame third baseman.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, it's Wade Boggs's drinking record, okay? The man's a legend.</p>
<p>He drank 50 beers on a cross-country flight and then absolutely destroyed the Seattle Mariners the next day, okay?</p>
<p>That's why we're doing this, to honor his memory, okay?</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>First off, Wade Boggs is very much alive. Secondly, the number of beers is actually highly disputed. Some say 50, some teammates said 60, some said as many as 70 beers.</p>
<p>Which, to be honest, is an absolutely insane amount of beer. Nobody can drink that much.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Not with an attitude like that.</p>
<p>Perhaps we're taking this a little bit too seriously?</p>
<p>Absolutely we're not, okay? The man is a legend.</p>
<p>That's why we're doing this, all right?</p>
<p>To honor his memory. Rest in peace, Wade.</p>
<p>Again, he is still alive.</p>
<p>Always sticking me with the nerds.</p>
<p>(call button chimes)</p>
<p>Yes, ma'am?</p>
<p>Uh, actually, I can, uh, handle this one.</p>
<p>We'll be sharing the in-flight call system today.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, let me explain.</p>
<p>We're doing a Wade Boggs-type thing, and that makes me sort of the Commissioner Bud Selig of the group.</p>
<p>Oh, you're the commissioner now?</p>
<p>Well, somebody's gotta keep the game fair and everybody invested, okay, Dee?</p>
<p>He didn't win the chugging contest.</p>
<p>Two more beers, please.</p>
<p>Actually, ma'am, we're about to take off, so we're gonna need you to stow your tray table.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>Let me take that and throw it out for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but just give me a second.</p>
<p>Okay? Just give me a second? There you go.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>(Dee belches)</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>Ugh! Ouch!</p>
<p>It's... really cold. Man, Dee...</p>
<p>(Dee belches)</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>You really have to slow down a little bit.</p>
<p>("Take Me Out to the Ball Game" plays)</p>
<p>Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll just get a beer, please.</p>
<p>(whispering): Hey, Frank. I'm a little concerned about this frat boy over here. There's only so many beers on the flight.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I'll take care of him.</p>
<p>For you, sir?</p>
<p>Excuse me, miss?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Um, actually, yeah... how many beers are we allowed to order at once?</p>
<p>I'm not sure. No one has ever asked that before.</p>
<p>Okay, great, so there's no rule on that. Uh, why don't you give me six, then, please? How about you make it an even dozen?</p>
<p>How about I start you with two apiece and then we just take it from there?</p>
<p>Sure, if you want to be lugging beers back and forth the entire flight. I guess that's, uh, up to you.</p>
<p>I'll be taking care of everybody on the Boggs account.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, do you sell condom?</p>
<p>No, I'm afraid we don't.</p>
<p>Aw...</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll have to figure something else out.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Hey... Frank.</p>
<p>Mmm?</p>
<p>What's with the condom thing?</p>
<p>You think the Boggs record is the only one I'm going for?</p>
<p>I'm gonna become the first-ever member of the Air sex Society.</p>
<p>Okay. What is that?</p>
<p>That means I'm gonna be plowing somebody in the bathroom before this plane lands.</p>
<p>Right, but do you think you just made that up? Because that's already a thing.</p>
<p>It's called the Mile High Club. People have been doing it since planes have been around.</p>
<p>That name sucks.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, though. I will make you a bet that I plow somebody on this fight, somewhere other than the bathroom, before we hit the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>I'll take that bet.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. Did I hear you guys talking about a bet? There's no betting, okay?</p>
<p>That compromises the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>It's got nothing to do with the Wade Boggs thing.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, okay, guys?</p>
<p>That's a rule, and as commissioner, you have to obey me.</p>
<p>Right, Commissioner.</p>
<p>Go get me another beer.</p>
<p>Okay, I will, but... not because you told me to, but because I'm commissioner and that's my job.</p>

<p>So what's going on with the sex moves?</p>
<p>I've been laying chum up and down this plane.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I know. I've noticed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've got my prey picked out. I'm just waiting for the right moment to pounce.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You haven't moved an inch. You're just drinking.</p>
<p>Oh, is that what you think?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Frank, of the 206 passengers on this flight, 98 of them are women, but only one of them is a suitable candidate: 44G.</p>
<p>Notice how she glances forlornly at the empty seat next to her.</p>
<p>It was meant for someone special.</p>
<p>And the tan line on her ring finger suggests the wound is still fresh, leaving her vulnerable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we hit turbulence earlier, she giggled, telling me she's a bit of a thrill seeker.</p>
<p>You think she offed the guy and went on the run?</p>
<p>Pretty tough to lay low in a dress like that.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not a particularly remarkable garment.</p>
<p>It's from the J.Crew Spring 2012 collection.</p>
<p>Although, it is a bit much for an airplane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if she were standing, you'd notice she's got no panty line, giving me about five extra seconds to enter her swiftly before she realizes I am not the answer to her problems.</p>
<p>(laughs) I'll tell you my tastes lie a little bit more in 39F.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, thank you, Frank. No, her blouse is covered in cigarette burns. And I imagine underneath that blouse, you'll find copious amounts of road rash, probably sustained in some sort of off-roading accident, which would also explain her limp. Although, something tells me the two are unrelated. Either way, she's North Dakota trash through and through and far beneath a gentleman such as myself.</p>

<p>Well, here-here's the thing. The game seems to be getting a little bit off the rails.</p>
<p>Frank and Dennis are super distracted and Dee is kind of just running away with it. Boggsy didn't drink six gallons of beer because he was obsessed with, like, breaking some record. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He did it 'cause he was just, like, thirsty, you know?</p>
<p>And looking to pass the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I can sell a rivalry, all right? What I can't sell is... 27 beers. What-what am I gonna do with 27 beers?</p>
