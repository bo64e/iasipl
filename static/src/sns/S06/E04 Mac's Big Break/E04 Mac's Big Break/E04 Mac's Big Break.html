<p>This a potentially life-changing opportunity right here.</p>
<p>Not potentially.</p>
<p>It is a life-changing opportunity. It is!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. How is spending a weekend at a radio show beach house a life-changing opportunity?</p>
<p>Dude, there is gonna be so many athletes and celebrities at that beach house.</p>
<p>This is my chance to finally sow myself into the inner circle.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be like a local sports legend.</p>
<p>Hey, can we have our phones back?</p>
<p>Em about using the minutes on the cell phones?</p>
<p>They used up all your minutes, right?</p>
<p>Frank, nobody gives a shit about minutes anymore.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what?</p>
<p>I do give a shit about minutes.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't, and I think I'm just probably buying into the phone company's propaganda, but there you go.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>Why are you taping them?</p>
<p>Oh, because they got great banter.</p>
<p>They jib jab.</p>
<p>Jib jab, jib jab, jib jab.</p>
<p>I use it for the car...</p>
<p>I jib jab.</p>
<p>'Cause my stereo's busted.</p>
<p>We have a lot of interesting things to say, so, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Well, I feel like the conversation we've been having in the last five minutes is a lot more interesting than the shit they're talking about on the radio.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>It's just moronic commentary and stupid sound effects, and it's just dumb.</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Well, we have voices.</p>
<p>We talk about the issues.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like we could do a podcast, and it would be a million times better than whatever that drivel was we were listening to.</p>
<p>Without a doubt.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>This sounds like jealousy talk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mac, Charlie, congratulations on, uh, your slap shot and the beach house, okay?</p>
<p>Uh, we're happy for you.</p>
<p>You're sad sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, why aren't you happy for us?</p>
<p>You're dark souls...</p>
<p>I mean, you know what?</p>
<p>You want to just do our thing and not...?</p>
<p>Let's do our thing.</p>
<p>Have fun with your important conversations and your big issues with your brains and your smart stuff, okay?</p>
<p>We got hockey to learn.</p>
<p>And we're gonna...</p>
<p>It's gonna change our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>You guys are the best.</p>
<p>Do not speak until I turn my tape over.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Aw, shit!</p>
<p>I taped over my Luther Vandross mix.</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>Okay, dude, now we're both in agreement.</p>
<p>This is probably, like, the biggest opportunity either of us have ever had in our lives, right?</p>
<p>We are not men who get a lot of opportunities, Charlie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The few we've had, we've squandered.</p>
<p>We've squandered them all.</p>
<p>That's why we've got to stay focused, Mac.</p>
<p>I mean, this is big time.</p>
<p>This is pro sports, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We got to do this right.</p>
<p>You got to look good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you can't miss that shot, right?</p>
<p>I really appreciate you helping me, dude.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Well, a little Peewee Hockey experience never hurts.</p>
<p>You're good.</p>
<p>Okay, so first things first.</p>
<p>Hold the hockey stick.</p>
<p>Hold the hockey stick?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, good, 'cause I was thinking, I'd have a position sort of like this.</p>
<p>(imitates wind whipping)</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>All of my instincts and my training tell me to use this as a weapon.</p>
<p>All of your instincts and your training are wrong.</p>
<p>Hold it like a hockey stick, or people are going to boo you.</p>
<p>The Philly fans are brutal, dude.</p>
<p>All right, fine!</p>
<p>All right? Right.</p>
<p>Then you just sort of haunch down a little bit... Done.</p>
<p>You might want to haun...</p>
<p>What if I do this? a...</p>
<p>That's way stiffer.</p>
<p>That's pretty good right there, Charlie.</p>
<p>You look so awkward.</p>
<p>Bro, when you tack on mass, you sacrifice flexibility.</p>
<p>That's just a straight-up fact.</p>
<p>That's insane.</p>
<p>Touch your toes.</p>
<p>What am I, a gymnast?</p>
<p>Yeah... Charlie, teach me how to shoot the shot.</p>
<p>All right, fine, fine.</p>
<p>Calm down. All right, all right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What you're gonna want to do is just gently...</p>
<p>Gently sort of guide the puck at the net, like... you know, like a tiny bowl of cream you don't want to spill, and you're guiding it.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna do that.</p>
<p>I'm going to go out there and take a wicked slap shot, you know?</p>
<p>(imitates wind whipping)</p>
<p>Really make a name for myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I go out there, I look like a jabroni.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Yeah, we might want to work on some kind of routine, huh?</p>
<p>Thank you. Exactly.</p>
<p>So I'll go out there.</p>
<p>I showcase my weaponry.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Pump the crowd up.</p>
<p>Really get the crowd up.</p>
<p>And raise the roof on 'em.</p>
<p>Watch. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Okay. But you know what?</p>
<p>You can't take a slap shot before you even know how to handle a stick and a puck, so will you just glide one?</p>
<p>Just to get the form.</p>
<p>And then we'll get bigger and bigger, and eventually, slap shots, but it starts with gliding like cream.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Gliding like a jabroni is what I'm gonna be doing.</p>
<p>Jabroni. Okay, go.</p>
<p>Well, that didn't do anything.</p>
<p>Well, that was pretty pathetic, you're right.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the problem is, I'm out in the elements, dude.</p>
<p>There's so much wind and sun.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And this asphalt...</p>
<p>That's not regulation.</p>
<p>No it's not regulation.</p>
<p>So it's not...</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>You want to do this the right way?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go to the ice.</p>
<p>Let's get some pucks, all right?</p>
<p>We'll slide, we'll take a few slap shots.</p>
<p>Let's go to the ice.</p>
<p>We'll do this the right way.</p>
<p>Let's go to the ice.</p>
<p>Let's go to the ice.</p>
<p>This is me.</p>
<p>All right, very exciting stuff.</p>
<p>I think we're pretty much ready to go here with this podcast.</p>
<p>What the hell is a podcast?</p>
<p>I mean, why don't you just tape it?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You don't have to tape it these days, Frank.</p>
<p>You just record it right onto the computer.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>And, uh, once we start recording, Frank, we need you to stop eating those crackers.</p>
<p>It's incredibly annoying, and it's all anyone's gonna be able to hear.</p>
<p>So, Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.</p>
<p>Inaugural podcast.</p>
<p>We're talking technology today.</p>
<p>The big T.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Everyone's talking about technology these days, because it's everywhere.</p>
<p>Oh, it is.</p>
<p>You can't escape it.</p>
<p>You absolutely can't.</p>
<p>So, Dee, tell us what you feel about technology.</p>
<p>How do you...?</p>
<p>What's your opinion on it?</p>
<p>(Frank crunching loudly)</p>
<p>Crackers?</p>
<p>I'm getting bored with this.</p>
<p>I'm going to bring my guest in.</p>
<p>Guest?</p>
<p>I asked Cricket to come.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Cricket?</p>
<p>No, Frank.</p>
<p>You can't just bring guests in here.</p>
<p>This is our podcast.</p>
<p>I feel like you're trying to take over.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Actually, this could bring up a pretty good issue.</p>
<p>If you bring Cricket in here, we could rail on him about the homeless issue.</p>
<p>Cricket!</p>
<p>Cricks.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Come on in, buddy.</p>
<p>We're ready for you.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, where's my chicken?</p>
<p>This is taking forever.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I promised him a rotisserie chicken.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Chop, chop.</p>
<p>I'm starving here.</p>
<p>What's going on with your voice?</p>
<p>It's from when Frank hit me with the trash can.</p>
<p>Wound got infected.</p>
<p>It was a whole ordeal.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Well, um... Listen, let's get into the issues here.</p>
<p>We're going to start rolling on this, Cricket.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I am not saying another word until I get the chicken.</p>
<p>I lied about the chicken, Crick.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>It was bullshit.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Why do I even trust you?</p>
<p>All right, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>I do have something for you.</p>
<p>Lemons.</p>
<p>Lemons?</p>
<p>Yeah, you suck on them.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>At least give me the crackers.</p>
<p>No, suck on a lemon.</p>
<p>Here, go ahead.</p>
<p>Well, they are good for scurvy.</p>
<p>All right, I'll have a few lemons, but then I'm out of here.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>So, uh, Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.</p>
<p>We are talking about the homeless issue here in Philly.</p>
<p>That's a big issue these days, and we're here with our friend Cricket.</p>
<p>He is a homeless man.</p>
<p>Cricket, walk us through a day in your life.</p>
<p>Oh, day in the life...</p>
<p>Well, uh, the other morning, I wake up, I find a dog sniffing at my wound.</p>
<p>He's fully aroused, mind you.</p>
<p>So I'm thinking, "Oh, great," you know, "what does this jerk want?"</p>
<p>Of course I know what he wants.</p>
<p>He's looking at me right in the eyes.</p>
<p>He does not have to say it.</p>
<p>Not that he could.</p>
<p>(slurps)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Oh, that is-that is tart.</p>
<p>That is really tart.</p>
<p>I mean, does my scar look like a dog's vagina?</p>
<p>You know, maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit here and try to get inside the mind of a dog.</p>
<p>I mean, that's God's work.</p>
<p>Well, not that I believe in God.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>Not since that Chinaman stole my kidney.</p>
<p>Cricket, tell Dee how much you think she's ugly.</p>
<p>That's not going to make any sense, Frank.</p>
<p>He doesn't think I'm ugly.</p>
<p>He's madly in love with me.</p>
<p>Don't flatter yourself.</p>
<p>I'm over you, sister.</p>
<p>Since when?</p>
<p>Since I found out you are a whore.</p>
<p>Will you stop talking about...</p>
<p>This has nothing...</p>
<p>Well, maybe you're a whore, you stupid, ugly, homeless bitch.</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>A dog banged your neck the other day.</p>
<p>You're both whores.</p>
<p>Well, a No, no, this is not good radio!</p>

<p>All right.</p>
<p>(imitates wind whipping)</p>
<p>Okay, this is exciting, Mack.</p>
<p>This is exciting.</p>
<p>You know, you're...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Would you take this seriously?</p>
<p>I am taking it seriously.</p>
<p>This is your big moment, man.</p>
<p>You got to walk out to center ice, and you got to be like, "Hey, USA! USA!"</p>
<p>USA!</p>
<p>Not like that.</p>
<p>Make it classy.</p>
<p>Okay, but keep in mind I am going to be wearing the duster.</p>
<p>Well, of course you're going to wear the duster.</p>
<p>That's going to look awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah. You should probably also be wearing a wig.</p>
<p>A wig?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Long, flowing hair.</p>
<p>That's going to look way more dramatic, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like... Okay, I like the wig idea in spirit.</p>
<p>Problem is, I'll have to wear the wig to the beach house so people will recognize me.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, I'm wearing a wig for the rest of my life just to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>Yeah, like Andre Agassi, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Let's not rule it out, though.</p>
<p>A good hockey wig could put this thing over the top, man.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Let's do this, let's do this thing!</p>
<p>All right, make some shots.</p>
<p>What else are we here for, dude?</p>
<p>Let's do some shots!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, you ready?</p>
<p>Hoo, hoo, hoo.</p>
<p>Let's see what you got.</p>
<p>Haunch.</p>
<p>(Mack groans, woman screams)</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>All right, well...</p>
<p>(whistle blows)</p>
<p>That would have been cool if I was standing backwards.</p>
<p>Well, you're not going to stand backwards, you're going to stand forwards.</p>
<p>You're going...</p>
<p>What the hell are you two doing out here?</p>
<p>(Mack laughs)</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, bro.</p>
<p>We're practising...</p>
<p>You can't be out here swinging hockey sticks.</p>
<p>You're not even supposed to be out here without skates.</p>
<p>Now get out!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Out!</p>
<p>Okay, we're leaving.</p>
<p>You know what, Charlie?</p>
<p>I think he's right, dude.</p>
<p>Only a couple of jabronis come out here without skates on.</p>
<p>I got to do this thing in skates, man.</p>
<p>You know, work up a routine, really jazz the crowd.</p>
<p>Yeah, can I stop you, though?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You keep using this word "jabroni," and... it's awesome.</p>
<p>(Mack chuckles)</p>
<p>It's, like, the coolest word ever.</p>
<p>Is that, like, a hockey thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>It's... I think it's some Dago word, but it sounds like a hockey word.</p>
<p>It does sound...</p>
<p>You're gonna want to brush up on your hockey words at the beach house.</p>
<p>You're going to be hanging out with the Flyers.</p>
<p>Okay, we are back.</p>
<p>Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.</p>
<p>Uh, we're back to the podcast.</p>
<p>We got a little derailed earlier.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>We did, but that's okay.</p>
<p>We're going to get back on track here.</p>
<p>Let's try and get back on track.</p>
<p>I got a hot topic that I want to talk about, Dee.</p>
<p>Tell me what it is.</p>
<p>Well, this is something I'm pretty charged up about.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>It's stem cell research.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>It's a very divisive issue these days.</p>
<p>Excellent one.</p>
<p>People are really going to town, one side against the other.</p>
<p>Some people are for it.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Some people are against it.</p>
<p>(duck quack sound effect)</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>That was a duck.</p>
<p>Why would you make a duck noise right in the middle of my thing?</p>
<p>I was doing a thing.</p>
<p>It was funny.</p>
<p>It's a duck noise.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you derailed us.</p>
<p>I thought it upped the production value.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>You know, add some sound effects.</p>
<p>Well, don't.</p>
<p>Okay, well... Okay, so stem cell research...</p>
<p>(brakes squeal, metal crunches)</p>
<p>Stop doing that.</p>
<p>Stem cell research is a very... (machine gun firing)</p>
<p>Why are you still...</p>
<p>Stop pushing sound effects.</p>
<p>I want to talk about... (laser blasts)</p>
<p>Which one was that one?</p>
<p>This one.</p>
<p>(laser blasts)</p>
<p>It's a laser beam.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like that one.</p>
<p>You like that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to pepper that one in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don't do it while I'm talking.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, we'll see.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank!</p>
<p>That's Frank Reynolds, everybody.</p>
<p>I have a great topic for you.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>War!</p>
<p>War?</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>Everyone's talking about the war.</p>
<p>And I have the perfect guest.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Ben the soldier.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>No. No, no, no.</p>
<p>I'm not comfortable with this.</p>
<p>Happening here.</p>
<p>Is the war happening here?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Let's get into all this stuff.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>Ben the soldier's here with us, folks, and I want to talk to him, because, Ben, it's my understanding that there is a war going on right now.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Am I right in this?</p>
<p>Well, actually, there are two wars right now.</p>
<p>Two wars?</p>
<p>You don't say.</p>
<p>We're in the midst of two wars all at once... Now, the United States of America is engaged in both of these wars?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, they are.</p>
<p>And are either of these wars happening on U.S. soil?</p>
<p>Ben...</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Let me, let me, let me...</p>
<p>What is your job in the war?</p>
<p>Are you a carrier of-of, uh, large weaponry?</p>
<p>Let me just... How about if we talk about how you used to bang each other?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What kind of technique did you use and tie-ups and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Frank, Frank.</p>
<p>Tie-ups.</p>
<p>It's not good radio.</p>
<p>'Cause people like sex.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let's... Okay, I just want to clarify what my producer Frank is actually referring to is the fact that Ben, our soldier here, and Dee used to be lovers.</p>
<p>(spring bounces)</p>
<p>(Dennis and Frank laugh)</p>
<p>Don't do that to me.</p>
<p>Don't do that to me.</p>
<p>That's a good one!</p>
<p>(spring bounces, Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>That's not funny.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>You're in the hot seat, girl.</p>
<p>I'm not in the hot seat.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>Yes, you're in the hot seat.</p>
<p>Ben's in the hot seat.</p>
<p>All right, Mac, so you're going to come on the ice and fire out to center, right?</p>
<p>Do, like, a cool turn and get the crowd going.</p>
<p>Okay, so fire out...</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What are you do...?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>That's not cool.</p>
<p>Wait, do you not know how to ice-skate?</p>
<p>No, not at all, but I figured you would teach me 'cause we got plenty of time.</p>

<p>All right, here, grab the stick.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>

<p>And take your top off.</p>
<p>(clock ticking)</p>
<p>(buzzing)</p>
<p>Fine, I'll do it.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>But I am not taking my top off.</p>
<p>Well, that's a relief to all of us.</p>
<p>Oh, zing, gotcha.</p>
<p>(gong clanging)</p>
<p>Couldn't find soup, but I found some dirty dishwater.</p>
<p>Boom, even better.</p>
<p>(screaming and laughter)</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(various wacky sound effects)</p>
<p>Oh, now this is good radio!</p>
<p>(duck quacks)</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude, there's a lot of people here.</p>
<p>I'm getting nervous, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, you might throw up when you get out there, you know, from the nerves.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be my coach, dude, don't tell me I'm going to throw up.</p>
<p>I know when people do that, so try not to throw up.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, dude.</p>
<p>Mac, Charlie, what's up?</p>
<p>Oh, hey, you guys came to support me.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that's why we're here.</p>
<p>Primarily, yeah, but... But also, you know, since we're here, we wanted to give you this tape so you could give it to those radio guys.</p>
<p>That's our demo tape.</p>
<p>We were recording the whole thing on a computer, but then the computer got water dumped all over it.</p>
<p>It was a whole thing.</p>
<p>Luther Vandross?</p>
<p>Is that still on there?</p>
<p>Oh, that's very off-putting, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should have re-labelled it.</p>
<p>It's not Luther Vandross.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell him it's not Luther Vandross.</p>
<p>All right, let's get going.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Mac from South Philly, get out here.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>This is you.</p>
<p>Here we go, here we go.</p>
<p>Everybody, say a prayer.</p>
<p>(Mac exhales)</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Give him the tape.</p>
<p>(crowd cheering)</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>The future of radio, you jabronis.</p>
<p>Jabronis... Cool word.</p>
<p>(dramatic (wild cheering)</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!</p>
<p>(crowd jeering)</p>
<p>Wake up, Mac.</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, wake up.</p>
<p>(Mac groaning)</p>
<p>Mac, wake up.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Did I do good, Charlie?</p>
<p>No, you fell on your face almost immediately, man.</p>
<p>Who took the shot?</p>
<p>I took the shot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I missed wide right by, like, a mile.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, dude, I think you're going to be a sports celebrity after all 'cause they're definitely going to play that shit on ESPN.</p>
<p>(wacky sound effect playing repeatedly)</p>
