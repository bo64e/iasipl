<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I got a tickle, a really bad one.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, are you getting sick?</p>
<p>If you're getting sick, stay away from us.</p>
<p>N-N-N-No, I'd better not be getting sick.</p>
<p>I can't be getting sick.</p>
<p>I got to be able to talk to Groban tomorrow.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Josh Groban.</p>
<p>Artemis and I got backstage passes to his concert in the park tomorrow.</p>
<p>Charles Grodin is coming in concert and you didn't tell us?</p>
<p>Aw, we love Charles Grodin.</p>
<p>That dude is hysteri... I love that guy.</p>
<p>He brings out the curmudgeon in me. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, different guy.</p>
<p>Josh Groban is who I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Josh Groban, oh.</p>
<p>Is he Charles Grodin's son?</p>
<p>He's probably funny.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>If he's related to Charles Grodin, he is. Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, two totally different people.</p>
<p>Charles Grodin is a bitter old man with a giant head, and Josh Groban is a beautiful singer with the voice of an angel.</p>
<p>Oh, he's a singer.</p>
<p>Call Charles Grodin a bitter old man one more time and see what happens!</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, calm down.</p>
<p>Alright, alright, sorry, alright, no big deal.</p>
<p>I got to go home anyway.</p>
<p>I should rest.</p>
<p>Stay... Come on.</p>
<p>No, don't come near me.</p>
<p>Don't make me sick. Alright, alright, don't touch me with that.</p>
<p>Don't make me sick. Get out!</p>
<p>Hey, stop it.</p>
<p>Mom, Mom, calm down, calm down, listen to me.</p>
<p>Okay, here's what you do, okay?</p>
<p>You close the curtains and you mind your own business, right?</p>
<p>They're not terrorists!</p>
<p>They're just Muslims.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I'm gonna hang up, okay? Hanging up.</p>
<p>Unbelievable, dude.</p>
<p>Ever since my Uncle Jack moved out, my mom's going crazy.</p>
<p>She's like, "Help me with this, help me with that, wash the floor, wash the ceiling, clean my car, get this, fix that.</p>
<p>Are there spiders here?</p>
<p>Are there spiders there?"</p>
<p>I'm sorry, the woman who brought you into the world and raised you needs you and you're going to ignore her?</p>
<p>Dude, it's crazy shit, it's insane shit, and I can't be constantly taking care of her.</p>
<p>I don't blame you, man.</p>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to not taking care of anyone when I'm older.</p>
<p>Well, what, what, you're not going to take care of me when I'm old?</p>
<p>Hell, no, I'm not going to take care of you; you were a terrible father to me.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll get Deandra to take care of me.</p>
<p>She'll take care of me.</p>
<p>Dee won't take care of you.</p>
<p>You just chased her out of here with a pool cue because she had a little cough.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Forget about it.</p>
<p>That's her.</p>
<p>Answer the phone, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm just going to let it ring 'cause it's crazy shit.</p>
<p>Charlie, answer the goddamn phone! Just...</p>
<p>It's not anything serious, Mac!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Hello, what, what is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, well, that is a serious thing.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll let him know. Uh, Mac, your mom burned her house down.</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Good news, Dennis.</p>
<p>Mom's okay.</p>
<p>She fell asleep with a lit cigarette in her mouth and burned the entire house down, but the good news is she's fine.</p>
<p>Uh, oh, great. Yeah.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Mac coughs)</p>
<p>Um, where is she going to be staying?</p>
<p>Here, of course.</p>
<p>I'll stay in a shelter.</p>
<p>Hey, there's an idea... Shelter.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Okay, what about a nice nursing home?</p>
<p>Nursing home?</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what happens in those places, dude?</p>
<p>Why don't I just rape her myself?</p>
<p>rape her...? What are you talking about? What?</p>
<p>Yo, got your dog.</p>
<p>Poppins, hey, buddy, how you doing?</p>
<p>Poppins.</p>
<p>My God, I can't believe that dog's not dead.</p>
<p>Didn't you get him when you were, like, ten?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, this dog is indestructible, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, that dog is nasty, man.</p>
<p>I mean, he was, like, coughing the whole way over here.</p>
<p>He ate a couple cigarette butts off the ground.</p>
<p>He's got a wheeze.</p>
<p>He might have emphysema, man.</p>
<p>Oh, that's entirely possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, it wouldn't slow him down, though; he's a survivor.</p>
<p>He would disappear for months, but he would always come home.</p>
<p>Yeah, it looks like his eye is falling out.</p>
<p>Oh, is it?</p>
<p>What, it just bulges?</p>
<p>Yeah, it bulges out a little bit there.</p>
<p>Yeah, what you do is you just pop it back with your knuckle.</p>
<p>I'll show you how to do it. It's real easy.</p>
<p>I'm never gonna do that, You're gonna touch his eye with your knuckle?</p>
<p>You just, you just sort of pop it back in.</p>
<p>Oh, hang on a second.</p>
<p>What, Mom, what?</p>
<p>I'm not going to vacuum your ceiling.</p>
<p>Um, 'cause I already did it, okay?!</p>
<p>Dude!</p>
<p>Plastic splinters are the same as...</p>
<p>You won't get a splinter!</p>
<p>I got to go deal with this, man.</p>
<p>My mom wants me to...</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>It's back in, Dennis, check it out.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I have an idea that's going to solve all of our problems here, I do.</p>
<p>Your moms are going to live together.</p>
<p>Now hear me out.</p>
<p>This is going to be great.</p>
<p>Okay, Mac, your mom burned down her house with a cigarette, right?</p>
<p>Charlie, Uncle Jack moved out of your mom's house, so she's lonely, she's got no one to talk to.</p>
<p>Boom...</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac, your mom together.</p>
<p>Could be the perfect situation.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>They could be like "The Golden Girls".</p>
<p>You know, a couple of old ladies getting together, chasing men, eating cheesecake.</p>
<p>That'd be cool.</p>
<p>Sure, whatever.</p>
<p>I'm loving that idea, but my mom's going to be a tough sell, man.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I'll talk her into it.</p>
<p>Oh, it popped back out.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Mac coughs)</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, I went to the health food store.</p>
<p>I just grabbed a whole bunch of shit.</p>
<p>It's supposed to boost my immune system.</p>
<p>I'm not going to miss that show, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm a Grobanite.</p>
<p>Grobanites don't miss shows.</p>
<p>Josh Groban comes to town and we consider it a call to action.</p>
<p>What you're saying is very dorky.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I brought you some stuff... A little bit of care package here.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I wanna make you well.</p>
<p>Coffee, I got you some Mexican peanuts...</p>
<p>I got you some candy...</p>
<p>I got you Stud magazine.</p>
<p>What's your angle?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Deandra..</p>
<p>We have to take care of each other.</p>
<p>I'm gonna take care of you now and when I'm old and sick, you have to take care of me.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, no. I'm not doing that. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>You're on your own.</p>
<p>But... You OK?</p>
<p>Yeah? No? Sit down.</p>
<p>Open up. Put your head back.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Ugh.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Look, you know what? You should go relax.</p>
<p>You should go rest now.</p>
<p>OK, look. I'm gonna do anything you need.</p>
<p>Anything you need, I will do it.</p>
<p>Just make believe I'm your slave.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do my laundry.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go rest. Don't bother me.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>No, no, no. I'm gonna be as quiet as a mouse.</p>
<p>You just rest, honey.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Okay, alright.</p>
<p>Well, ladies, I know this is a lot to digest, and that's why I'm here... to act as an unbiased negotiator in the process, and to sort out any problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Essentially just to make sure that you're both comfortable with this new arrangement.</p>
<p>I don't want to live with her.</p>
<p>Oh! Mom, why not?!</p>
<p>She smells.</p>
<p>I know she smells.</p>
<p>Alright... Okay, you can't talk about my mom like that.</p>
<p>Okay... You don't smell, and you look beautiful, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, I think what Charlie's mom is trying to say is that Mrs. Mac has a unique and earthy fragrance.</p>
<p>I smell like shit.</p>
<p>Okay, Mom, don't put yourself down, okay?</p>
<p>We talked about this.</p>
<p>You know, perhaps we could get Mrs.</p>
<p>Mac some perfume?</p>
<p>Oh, that's not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac, what do you say?</p>
<p>What better way to kick off this new relationship than with a new fragrance?</p>
<p>Stop talking to me like I'm an asshole.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She can't smoke in here.</p>
<p>I know, Mom. Uh...</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, well, that's... Well, now, Mrs.</p>
<p>Mac, I would never ask you to give up tobacco, but what if you were to switch to some sort of smokeless tobacco alternative?</p>
<p>Ugh! (grunts)</p>
<p>I know that grunt.</p>
<p>She's open to it.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do we say, we do a little bit of a trial run tonight?</p>
<p>Let's see what happens, and then we'll take it from there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That means absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great, great, great.</p>
<p>So, last step. Dog's tied up outside.</p>
<p>I'll grab him and get him inside and be on my way.</p>
<p>No, no, no dog.</p>
<p>Charlie, tell them.</p>
<p>OK, she is terrified of animals eating her face off...</p>
<p>I don't want a dog to eat my face, Charlie.</p>
<p>You want a dog eating her face?</p>
<p>Well, you know, That's not a problem.</p>
<p>We'll take the dog.</p>
<p>Oh, what I think Mac is trying to say... is not that we'll take the dog...</p>
<p>I'm saying exactly what I wanna say.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say now is that we're taking the dog.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say, Frank...</p>
<p>We're taking the dog.</p>
<p>We're not taking the dog...</p>
<p>He's not going to eat my mother's face off.</p>
<p>He's gonna be home with us.</p>
<p>Alright, alright, alright!</p>
<p>Fine, we'll take the dog.</p>
<p>Laundry's done.</p>
<p>Uh, those white shorts on top?</p>
<p>That's part of my outfit for tomorrow, so why don't you go and run an iron over those?</p>
<p>Oh! Hey, very whitey white.</p>
<p>Uh, you're not ragging it, are you?</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>What? Gross, Frank.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You still get periods?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Stop asking me that.</p>
<p>What? Gross! Come on.</p>
<p>I'm trying to bond with you.</p>
<p>That's how you want to bond with me? Asking me if I still get periods?</p>
<p>What's that stuff you're putting on?</p>
<p>That's beautiful. What is it?</p>
<p>Self tanner. For tomorrow.</p>
<p>Got to look good for Groban.</p>
<p>The, uh, tan's gonna make the white in the outfit pop, the white's gonna make the tan pop.</p>
<p>Josh Groban likes his ladies to pop, so...</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey, look who I brought.</p>
<p>It's Poppins! Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>That's Poppins?</p>
<p>Ooh. Yeah.</p>
<p>He's still alive?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I figured he could keep you company while you're sick.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Dog looks like a gargoyle.</p>
<p>Yeah. He smells like piss.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Does it? Uh, uh-oh.</p>
<p>Is he dying?</p>
<p>No, no, no, he's fine.</p>
<p>Uh, by the way, you're gonna want to keep him away from that cream, too, 'cause he'll eat that shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, he ate a whole bottle of shampoo at our apartment earlier.</p>
<p>He loves shit like that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sounds great.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing him over, yeah.</p>
<p>Great dog.</p>
<p>He's a great dog.</p>
<p>I'm gonna finish this up in my bedroom.</p>
<p>Frank, why don't you make me another juice?</p>
<p>'Cause I feel like that green stuff's really working.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Great. So, you'll keep the dog here, and then, uh...</p>
<p>What are you doing, Frank?</p>
<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>Trying to score brownie points with your sister.</p>
<p>I mean, I need somebody to take care of me when I'm old and sick.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus, you're still worried about that?</p>
<p>Why don't you just check yourself into a nursing home, Frank?</p>
<p>You have the money.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna put myself into one of those crypts.</p>
<p>As soon as you drop the soap, they rape your butt.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's what happens.</p>
<p>Mac told me.</p>
<p>What are you...? God...</p>
<p>People have a very strange conception of what goes on in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Frank, green juice, now!</p>
<p>(groans) The bitch is driving me crazy!</p>
<p>She's not even sick anymore.</p>
<p>You know, I support your plan, Frank, in so far as it insures that I won't have to take care of you when you get older, but you're going about this all wrong, honestly.</p>
<p>How do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, she's in her apartment.</p>
<p>She's comfortable here.</p>
<p>She's on her home turf.</p>
<p>She's got all her amenities, she feels good here.</p>
<p>She doesn't need you here.</p>
<p>You need to thrust her into a hostile environment.</p>
<p>So that she needs you to protect her.</p>
<p>I should dump her under the bridge.</p>
<p>Dump her under the bridge? No, don't dump her under the bridge.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You need to be there, Frank.</p>
<p>That's the whole point.</p>
<p>Just take her to your apartment, OK?</p>
<p>Now, separately, if this is going to work, she's gonna need to feel a little bit more than just a tickle on her throat.</p>
<p>So if she's not feeling sick, well...</p>
<p>Then we're just have to make her feel sick.</p>
<p>You're good.</p>
<p>Well, I'm a fixer, Frank, is what.</p>
<p>You're good.</p>
<p>That's what I do.</p>
<p>Dennis, listen, we should hang out more together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Stop trying to bond with me.</p>
<p>They're not even talking to each other.</p>
<p>My mom's not very verbal.</p>
<p>I know, but they haven't even touched their cheesecake.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like if you and I were in a room with a perfectly good cheesecake, all sorts of conversation would start happening.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, the funniest thing happened today when I was doing the laundry.</p>
<p>Mom, no, not me.</p>
<p>You got to talk to her, okay?</p>
<p>Don't talk to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretend like we're not even here, Mrs. Kelly, okay?</p>
<p>Go gossip.</p>
<p>About what?</p>
<p>Maybe you were at a supermarket one time, and you met a cute guy, and you were feeling saucy, and then you wanted to go back and talk to your friend, Sophia.</p>
<p>So you're like Blanche and she's like Sophia.</p>
<p>So, go ahead.</p>
<p>I don't go to the supermarket.</p>
<p>The shopping carts are dangerous.</p>
<p>Shopping carts are not dangerous, Mom.</p>
<p>There's nothing dangerous about a shopping cart!</p>
<p>Let's try a new tack.</p>
<p>Everybody, calm down.</p>
<p>This isn't working. Alright.</p>
<p>TV's going off. Boom.</p>
<p>Okay! That's good, right?</p>
<p>You guys are roommates now, so maybe you can get to know one another.</p>
<p>I'm hot.</p>
<p>My mom's hot.</p>
<p>I'm hot, too.</p>
<p>Okay, I got to be honest.</p>
<p>I'm hot, as well.</p>
<p>Can we turn the fan on?</p>
<p>Okay, well, the fan is broken.</p>
<p>It hasn't worked for years.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, okay. That's good.</p>
<p>My mom's very good with her hands.</p>
<p>Maybe she can fix it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Mom was the manager at Jiffy Lube for many years.</p>
<p>I never heard about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, she doesn't like to brag.</p>
<p>It's not her style.</p>
<p>Yeah, but she started at the bottom, worked her way to the tippy top.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was just three people working at Jiffy Lube.</p>
<p>It's not really a high climb.</p>
<p>Okay, well, please don't diminish my mother's achievements, okay?</p>
<p>Well, don't get too excited about your mother's achievements.</p>
<p>Okay, could you...</p>
<p>Mom, do you want to take a look at that fan, and see if you can fix it?</p>
<p>(grumbles indistinctly)</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>It means, "Not right now, but there's a possibility that I could get to it tomorrow."</p>
<p>See, the problem is, once that sun goes down, you're not going to get this woman to do anything 'cause she thrives on sunlight.</p>
<p>She seems like she's never been in sunlight.</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p>(spits)</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>That's nasty.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, she's spitting into my porcelain.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that makes you mad.</p>
<p>Take it up with her!</p>
<p>Have a conversation with her.</p>
<p>Everybody, can we just...</p>
<p>Let's relax for a second.</p>
<p>Maybe I can get you, like, a...</p>
<p>Like, a beer bottle, would that be okay?</p>
<p>An empty beer bottle to spit in?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Okay, having fun.</p>

<p>Where's she going?</p>
<p>She thinks she's going to the concert?</p>
<p>I don't know. She's walking.</p>
<p>She's, like, in a zombie state.</p>
<p>Ooh, she's going to bounce off all the walls.</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>It's incredible.</p>
<p>Outside. She's going out.</p>
<p>Ooh, she's going to hit the skateboard.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Ah, did you see that? It's like Mr. Magoo.</p>

<p>The woman's out of her damn mind.</p>
<p>Hey! Get the hell...</p>
<p>Is she waking up my mom?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, Mom!</p>
<p>My mom does not like to be woken up, Mrs. Kelly!</p>

<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, just playing it safe.</p>
<p>She's been doing it.</p>
<p>I'm still alive.</p>
<p>Can't be crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that's very crazy.</p>
<p>It does feel good to do stuff in threes.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm pulling the plug on this whole thing, all right?</p>
<p>'Cause this and this?</p>
<p>This has got to stop.</p>
<p>Yeah you're right.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, I'm getting my mom out of here.</p>
<p>Let's just go to bed.</p>
<p>Yeah, this has not been a good situation.</p>
<p>Let's go to bed.</p>
<p>This one look off to you?</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>No, it's fine. It's fine.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, we got some bagels and coffee.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, mom.</p>
<p>Uh, where's your chewing tobacco?</p>
<p>You know Mrs. Kelly doesn't like the smoke.</p>
<p>Oh, the ceiling fan is going to push all the smoke outside the windows.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, she's fixing the fan?</p>
<p>See? I told you, dude...</p>
<p>My mom is very handy.</p>
<p>Oh. The Muslims are back.</p>
<p>Where do you think they're coming and going from?</p>
<p>Damn foreigners!</p>
<p>They ain't American, I don't want to know 'em.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I wish they'd all go back to the desert.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>So it does seem like they're bonding, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, it's not really a Golden Girls type conversation, it's, like, a racist conversation, but...</p>
<p>Where the hell is my damn screwdriver?</p>
<p>I'm wiping all the germs off for you.</p>
<p>(groans): Quit cleaning my damn tools and sit your ass down! (coughs loudly)</p>
<p>shit, dude, we might want to even consider bringing Poppins back into this mix.</p>
<p>It does seem to be working.</p>
<p>Like it?</p>
<p>Ooh! Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Please don't hit me.</p>
<p>I have sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Let's just find the dog, and we'll talk about it there.</p>
<p>(whispers): Okay, alright.</p>
<p>Let's just let them be, though, huh?</p>
<p>Mm. Mm, mm.</p>

<p>Ooh, big-time.</p>
<p>You guys untie me right now!</p>
<p>Okay, I'll untie you if you promise to remember that I took care of you good.</p>
