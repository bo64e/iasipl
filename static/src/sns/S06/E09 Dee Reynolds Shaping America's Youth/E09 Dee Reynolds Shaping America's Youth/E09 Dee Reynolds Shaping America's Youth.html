<p>(school bell rings)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Here comes my main man, Matty.</p>
<p>Time for a haircut, Matty, though.</p>
<p>Don't make me give it to you.</p>
<p>You the man, Professor.</p>
<p>You're the man if you stay in school, JJ.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, you.</p>
<p>Lisa, how's the GPA?</p>
<p>Keep it up, up, up, up, up!</p>
<p>Professor!</p>
<p>Hey, there's my man.</p>
<p>Oh, time-out, son!</p>
<p>Hang on, son.</p>
<p>Uh, did you forget something here?</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>This orange, it belong to you?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Looks pretty good, not too peeled.</p>
<p>Pretty intact here. You want it?</p>
<p>No, thanks, I'm cool, Professor.</p>
<p>You're cool?</p>
<p>Well, when you're cool, you're cool.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee, how's it going?</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Teacher's lounge. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>How'd you swing that?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: I'm a teacher now, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm subbing for Dr.</p>
<p>Myers while he gets his hip fixed.</p>
<p>Look at us with our new careers, huh?</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>Well, yours is kinda the same, you know, 'cause you've always sort of been a janitor.</p>
<p>Ah, but I'm thriving here, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Uh-huh, yea Did you get that orange out of the garbage?</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>Can you believe that?</p>
<p>Someone threw this away, perfectly good orange, you know?</p>
<p>They were digging at it a little bit and must've given up, but...</p>
<p>Don't eat trash, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'll eat what I want to eat, okay?</p>
<p>(over P.A.): Miss Reynolds, please report to the front office immediately.</p>
<p>You have an emergency call.</p>
<p>Miss Reynolds, to the front office, please.</p>
<p>Emergency?</p>
<p>Jump on that.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, hey, Dee, it's Dennis, Mac and Frank.</p>
<p>Hey, what's the matter?</p>
<p>I've only just heard, I've only just heard your belly's so fat, you make John Candy look like Lara Flynn Boyle.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Snap!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: We've been on the snap-joke kick about your pregnant body, but since you're not around, we decided to call you.</p>
<p>He's talking about Lara Flynn Boyle jokes.</p>
<p>I think we got some better ones.</p>
<p>Goddammit, guys.</p>
<p>I am a teacher now.</p>
<p>I don't have time for your shit, you dumbass dickbags!</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>Wrong number. Sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, good morning, everybody.</p>
<p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
<p>Uh, as you are all aware, Dr. Myers recently broke his hip, and unfortunately, I've been given some devastating news that he's taken a turn for the worse, and he's died.</p>
<p>(voice breaking): Now while we all feel robbed of him here on Earth, heaven above has just received another angel.</p>
<p>And that is what you call (normal voice): a monologue!</p>
<p>You guys, you're all going to be doing your own monologues in this class.</p>
<p>Now, they're not gonna be as good as mine just was, but listen, I don't want you to beat yourselves up for...</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I'm confused.</p>
<p>So, Dr. Myers isn't dead?</p>
<p>No, no, no, not dead.</p>
<p>Very much alive, but that's the power of acting.</p>
<p>Do you see what I'm saying?</p>
<p>One minute dead...</p>
<p>The next minute alive...</p>
<p>Resurrection.</p>
<p>It's all acting.</p>
<p>Everywhere there's acting.</p>
<p>Let's talk about you guys.</p>
<p>Why don't you tell me, uh, what your favorite play is.</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you've ever seen live theater.</p>
<p>Seriously? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>All right, that's it.</p>
<p>I am taking you guys on a field trip to Broadway!</p>
<p>I'm taking you to New York City.</p>
<p>(all cheer)</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, fat bitch, how you doing today, Richard?</p>
<p>He's a happy clown.</p>
<p>Hey-hey-hey, break it up, break it up!</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>All right, which one of you guys did this?</p>
<p>Who painted your face, kid?</p>
<p>I did. He's a dumbass juggalo.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Juggalos for life, bitch!</p>
<p>Watch what you say, Richard.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, you watch what you say!</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>I want the three of you out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>I'm talking to the clown.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>And I got my eyes on you guys for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've sized you up, I've strip you down.</p>
<p>I don't like what I see.</p>
<p>I'm not impressed.</p>
<p>Big tough guys, huh?</p>
<p>Big tough guys!</p>
<p>All right, kid, what's going on with the clown makeup, though?</p>
<p>You're sticking out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>That's 'cause I'm a juggalo... ICP!</p>
<p>Insane Clown Posse, yo.</p>
<p>I don't know what that...</p>
<p>You have a posse? Well, good.</p>
<p>Stick with your insane clown people, and you won't get jumped.</p>
<p>They're a band, dude.</p>
<p>I'm, like, a die-hard fan.</p>
<p>We're called juggalos.</p>
<p>Where are you real friends, dude?</p>
<p>I lost all my friends.</p>
<p>Aw, shit, man.</p>
<p>I lost all my friends, too.</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>You know, if you want to wear your clown makeup in school, wear it.</p>
<p>I got your back.</p>
<p>You won't get jumped.</p>
<p>Yeah, I ain't exactly allowed to wear my makeup in school, though.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Bunch of bullshit, dawg!</p>
<p>That is bullshit!</p>
<p>All right, kid, today's your lucky day, all right?</p>
<p>We're gonna talk to the principal, okay?</p>
<p>'Cause the Professor just took an interest in ya!</p>
<p>I'm bored to tears!</p>
<p>Let's go harass Charlie and Dee.</p>
<p>We don't need Charlie and Dee to have fun, okay?</p>
<p>We can figure out something to do without them.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, guys, now might be a good time to do our Lethal Weapon 5 reshoots.</p>
<p>Why would we do reshoots on that?</p>
<p>That movie was perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was great in it, and my villain was very evil.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, you did a great job, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about that.</p>
<p>Your villain was amazing.</p>
<p>I'm referring more at the black face.</p>
<p>With its all...</p>
<p>What's wrong with the black face?</p>
<p>Well, I seriously regret switching parts with you halfway though and letting you play Murtaugh in blackface.</p>
<p>I feel like it was in very poor taste in retrospect.</p>
<p>I think it was in poor taste that you were doing Murtaugh in whiteface.</p>
<p>I mean, for God's sakes, Dennis, what message does that send?</p>
<p>A lot of great actors have done blackface.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, there's countless examples of very classy actors doing blackface.</p>
<p>Let's see, we've got the great C.</p>
<p>Thomas Howell in Soul Man, we've got the Wayans brothers in White Chicks.</p>
<p>That was a very tasteful example of reverse blackface.</p>
<p>Okay, those are bad examples, okay?</p>
<p>There's tons of good examples of old movies with... Frank, help me out.</p>
<p>Laurence Olivier in Othello.</p>
<p>Laurence Olivier in Othello, dude.</p>
<p>That's, like, the classiest actor of all time. Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I guarantee you there was some black people that were working on that movie that were, like, "Man, what dat white man doing?</p>
<p>Come on. That ain't right.</p>
<p>Get a black man."</p>
<p>Okay, so hold on.</p>
<p>What kind of voice is that?</p>
<p>You're doing a black voice and that's not racist?</p>
<p>I'm just saying that's how black people talk. That's not racist.</p>
<p>So you would do a black guy with a black voice, but not a black guy with a black face?</p>
<p>I don't have a problem at all with doing a black voice.</p>
<p>That's just an accurate portrayal...</p>
<p>I don't understand that, dude.</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's just about doing it tastefully, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you got to make the lips funny.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>No, no, no. What?</p>
<p>They have to be funny.</p>
<p>The lips have to be outlined.</p>
<p>It's not about being funny at all, okay?</p>
<p>It's not about funny.</p>
<p>It's about...</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I'm getting pissed off!</p>
<p>Well, you can't do the voice without the lips.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, everybody calm down.</p>
<p>Clearly, we're not gonna come to any conclusions here today, so let's move past it.</p>
<p>Let's do something else.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>We can find something to do.</p>
<p>Let's just figure it out.</p>
<p>Let's just figure it out.</p>
<p>Let's put our heads together.</p>
<p>Come on. Think, think.</p>
<p><strong>Principal</strong>: So, you want to take them to New York.</p>
<p>Yes, to Broadway.</p>
<p>And I tell you what, I brought it up... the kids are super stoked about it.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Um, you know, I-I... I guess the first point I'd like to... to make... Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>...uh, Miss Reynolds, is, uh, you are a substitute.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>So I really don't think you should be hauling students across state lines.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Secondly... secondly, the funding for arts programs here is pretty much... it's pretty much nonexistent.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's shameful, but that's the way it is, so even if I did have the money, I would never... and I emphasize never... give it to someone whom I've just met.</p>
<p>Knock, knock, knock.</p>
<p>Uh, am I interrupting?</p>
<p>Yes, we're right in the middle of something.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>She's not giving you too much trouble, is she?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>So you two know each other.</p>
<p>No, we met in the...</p>
<p>Yeah, we're best friends.</p>
<p>Best friends.</p>
<p>We're best friends.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Uh, Principal McIntyre, I recently, uh...</p>
<p>I started mentoring one of the kids here.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>That's odd, because you're a janitor.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, but Ritchie here is a hell of a kid, and he's struggling.</p>
<p>You see, he's what he calls, uh, a juggler.</p>
<p>Juggalo, bro.</p>
<p>Juggalo... he's a juggalo.</p>
<p>It's sort of a clown posse.</p>
<p>I figured you and I were getting tight enough that I could maybe come in here and ask that he be allowed to wear his makeup in school.</p>
<p>Uh, well, uh... you know, it's school policy that no one should paint their face.</p>
<p>So... that's the rule, and that's the end of that.</p>
<p>That's the rule.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>There's no wiggle room there.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right, tell you what.</p>
<p>I'll take him down to the locker room, I'll lather him up real good, I'll strip all these silly-ass clothes off him, and I'll clean him, sparking clean.</p>
<p>Brand-new kid for you.</p>
<p>Bring him back up.</p>
<p>No, no, no, please, don't bathe the students.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>He's a big man.</p>
<p>He can bathe himself, can't you, Rich?</p>
<p>Yeah, dawg... All right, he's bathing himself, and I'm watching.</p>
<p>Let's go, Ritchie.</p>
<p>You're getting cleaned up.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Oh, I'd rather you didn't do that, either.</p>
<p>Okay, there it is.</p>
<p>Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer.</p>
<p>How is that not racist to you?</p>
<p>Okay, this is a terrible example of blackface.</p>
<p>This guy isn't even trying to look like a real person.</p>
<p>Well he almost got the mouth right...</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying about the lips.</p>
<p>They got to be...</p>
<p>The lips are the most offensive part.</p>
<p>Look, the guy is bugging his eyes out like a cartoon character, okay?</p>
<p>This is racist as shit.</p>
<p>All blackface is racist, Mac, and that is the point I'm trying to make.</p>
<p>You just cannot cast a white man as a black man and paint his face black.</p>
<p>You can't do it.</p>
<p>They're actors.</p>
<p>They're trying to create an illusion.</p>
<p>You know, in the Lord of the Rings movie, Ian McKellen plays a wizard.</p>
<p>Do you think he goes home at night and shoots laser beams into his boyfriend's asshole?</p>
<p>I don't think so, dude.</p>
<p>Tom Cruise is a midget, all right, but he plays guys that are normal size in movies, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but again, nobody's buying that, either.</p>
<p>Okay, look.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>This is Laurence Olivier in Othello, and this is James Earl Jones.</p>
<p>Now, look at how close they look.</p>
<p>Look at that... James Earl Jones is doing a great blackface.</p>
<p>James Earl Jones has a black face!</p>
<p>He's a black man.</p>
<p>He's not black. James Earl Jones...</p>
<p>Of course, he's black!</p>
<p>He was Darth Vader!</p>
<p>Darth Vader was black?</p>
<p>See, okay, there we go.</p>
<p>Darth Vader was not black.</p>
<p>They took the mask off.</p>
<p>He was white.</p>
<p>(Mac sighs)</p>
<p>I'm telling you, look, look.</p>
<p>We got to agree on this.</p>
<p>The whole idea is getting the right color shoe polish.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Oh, Frank, if you're starting with shoe polish, you're starting off on the wrong foot, buddy.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Shoe polish? Come on.</p>
<p>And he's on your side.</p>
<p>Stop arguing for me, okay?</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Hold on, this is Dee.</p>
<p>Let-let's... Hey, hey, Dee, uh, can you weigh in on something for us?</p>
<p>We're trying...</p>
<p>Hey, no, no time.</p>
<p>Uh, listen, I need you to do something for me.</p>
<p>Can you clear out the bar?</p>
<p>Because I'm going to bring some students from the classroom by, and we're going to screen a movie there.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I need these kids to respect me, you know, and I want to show them how cool I am, so... plus I feel like this would be a really good opp...</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis, Dennis, cover it up, cover it up.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to screen Laurence Olivier's Othello movie, you know?</p>
<p>Then we can get an audience to weigh in.</p>
<p>That's not a bad idea.</p>
<p>We can really take the temperature on this with a large group.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kids are honest as shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hi! Hello!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Dee, we're on it.</p>
<p>We'll take care of the movie.</p>
<p>No, no, you're not taking care of the movie.</p>
<p>You're not railroading me on this, okay?</p>
<p>This is my thing, it's my movie.</p>
<p>Don't... I'll do the movie.</p>
<p>No, Dee, it's a classic.</p>
<p>Okay? It's Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Othello, Laurence Olivier.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Othello.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I have to apologize.</p>
<p>That's actually a really good idea.</p>
<p>Ooh, plus it'll give me the opportunity...</p>
<p>Okay, enough of that.</p>
<p>Guys, let's get set up for a screening.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>Uh, gentlemen, hello.</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>Long time, no see.</p>
<p>I'd like to introduce you to my protégé Ritchie.</p>
<p>Ritchie, these are the guys.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hello. What up?</p>
<p>Juggalo for life.</p>
<p>What the hell is he talking about?</p>
<p>Drop it with the whole juggalo thing.</p>
<p>You're embarrassing me.</p>
<p>Okay, now, I know you're all super stoked about watching a movie in a bar, but we're just going to keep it on the down-low.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>We don't need your parents and the principal finding out.</p>
<p>It's just our little secret.</p>
<p>I've been in a bar before.</p>
<p>No, you haven't.</p>
<p>I've been in this bar before, so...</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>Let's just watch the movie and stop with our smart mouths.</p>
<p>Without further ado, Othello.</p>
<p>So I guess this is a Shakespearean movie.</p>
<p>It's going to be a little bit boring.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, Lethal Weapon 5!</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>It's our movie.</p>
<p>It's a much more modern-day example of blackface.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's the most direct way to clear up our argument, Dee, so...</p>
<p>What argument?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>(shushing)</p>
<p>The movie's on.</p>
<p>This is a good movie, Ritchie.</p>
<p>You're going to enjoy this.</p>
<p>Man, I ain't seen the first couple, though.</p>
<p>Happy retirement, Rog.</p>
<p>I'll be happy when I'm far away from your sorry ass, Riggs.</p>
<p>Just blow out the candles, Rog, make a wish.</p>
<p>Ah, I never know what to wish for with these damn things.</p>
<p>That voice really is amazing, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, man, thank you.</p>
<p>Riggs, Murtaugh, bad news, fellas.</p>
<p>Hey, Captain.</p>
<p>Turns out another person just died from tainted tap water.</p>
<p>Turns out someone taint... someone tapped the tainted water supply.</p>
<p>We should have cut him out completely.</p>
<p>The person who just died was your wife.</p>
<p>Riggs...</p>
<p>Yeah, Rog.</p>
<p>I just thought of my wish.</p>
<p>(Frank chuckling)</p>
<p>You like sharks, Detective?</p>
<p>Powerful and majestic creatures.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Frank splurged on a green screen.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he wouldn't pay for the green screen on our side, so...</p>
<p>We're not in the back office.</p>
<p>We're-we're in a casino.</p>
<p>Why would I know anything about the tainted water?</p>
<p>Maybe because your rival tribe owns the water rights to half of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I need clean drinking water, too!</p>
<p>Even sharks need water.</p>
<p>Excuse me. If you leave now, I have some pressing matter to deal with.</p>
<p>(Frank grunting)</p>
<p>Kinda comes out of nowhere, but at least it's classy.</p>
<p>Here comes the turn.</p>
<p>(Frank grunting)</p>
<p>I don't know why we, uh...</p>
<p>(grunting continues)</p>
<p>(Richard groans)</p>
<p>Oh, Chief!</p>
<p>Don't say anything. Quiet!</p>
<p>Quiet. Good. Very nice. Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>This is unwatchable.</p>
<p>Gotta dive in.</p>
<p>Just finish already!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(Dennis screaming)</p>
<p>(Charlie laughing evilly)</p>
<p>Now that you're Riggs and not Murtaugh, and I have caught you, you are going to get it.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>You guys switched parts?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(Charlie laughs evilly)</p>
<p>(Dennis yelling)</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>(neck cracks)</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>(Dennis grunting)</p>
<p>As more people die, the city will be looking to new resources for water like my tribe!</p>
<p>And you can bet your boots, Detective, that this time... - This is regrettable.</p>
<p>(Mac chuckles)</p>
<p>You're supposed to be... a noble people.</p>
<p>I tire of this conversation.</p>
<p>Do you have any last words?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got some last words.</p>
<p>(goofy breathing)</p>
<p>Go suck an egg.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, go suck an egg.</p>
<p>Suck an egg?</p>
<p>(Australian accent): Sounds like you guys are having a great party.</p>
<p>Why wasn't I invited?</p>
<p>(wind whipping, grunting)</p>
<p>(wind whipping)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>(laughing): Oh!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(tires squeak)</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>(Mac sighs)</p>
<p>It's playing. It's playing.</p>
<p>(gunshots)</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>(Dennis panting)</p>
<p>This is the greatest movie I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Are you filming this, Ritchie?</p>
<p>No. Come on, dude.</p>
<p>That's-that's bootlegging.</p>
<p>I'll get you a copy, don't bootleg.</p>
<p>Okay, you want to dance?</p>
<p>(Frank chuckles)</p>
<p>(mumbling)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>(gunshots)</p>
<p>How about a little tainted tap water?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(gasps, electrical popping)</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>(Frank mumbles)</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>Great job, Rog.</p>
<p>That's one... fried turkey.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>We got 'em... baby.</p>
<p>I miss you, kid.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>(gunshots)</p>
<p>(both yelling)</p>
<p>(explosive pop)</p>
<p>♪ There's a hungry road backed with lonely hopes gonna eat me up... ♪</p>
<p>Okay. Wow.</p>
<p>I think that video says more than I ever could.</p>

<p>So... we're fired, yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
