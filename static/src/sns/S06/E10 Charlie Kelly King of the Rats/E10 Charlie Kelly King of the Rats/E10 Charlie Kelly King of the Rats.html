<p><strong>Mac</strong>: So like you said, when you come face-to-face with something like that, what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>(Charlie groaning)</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Oof!</p>
<p>Oh, hey, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, what's going on there, pal?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, my God, I just found a rat's nest.</p>
<p>Slaughtered about 200 of 'em.</p>
<p>200? Couldn't be. That's...</p>
<p>Jesus Christ...</p>
<p>Oh, it's like, it's like whole generations of those things have died at my hands, and... mothers, fathers, grandfathers, little baby rats. (scoffs)</p>
<p>Mmm, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, you know, keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder though, if our lives are really more valuable than theirs, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Our lives are definitely...</p>
<p>Yeah. without a doubt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Without a doubt.</p>
<p>If that makes you feel any better.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I suppose I oughta...</p>
<p>Get back to it?</p>
<p>Yep. Jump right back in there, tiger.</p>
<p>Get on the horse.</p>
<p>Charlie, bash, bash 'em up.</p>
<p>Do what you do best.</p>
<p>Alright. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Yep. Oh, God.</p>
<p>I just gotta go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Alright, man.</p>
<p>He touched me with it.</p>
<p>Ugh! God, what a life, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Today's his birthday.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Poor guy, on a day like this.</p>
<p>We oughta do something nice for him.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Definitely.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oh! You want to get him a new rat stick?</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Abso... I was thinking maybe we should throw him a surprise party.</p>
<p>He is really bummed.</p>
<p>I guess we could do something nice for him.</p>
<p>Definitely. Listen, for one day let's make the poor bastard feel special.</p>
<p>For one day let's make this lowly rat killer feel like a king.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In the simplest... Easiest... way. ...easiest.</p>
<p>I'm tired today, you know?</p>
<p>Here it is. I got it!</p>
<p>I'm thinking we go with a Hawaiian trip-hop, underground Huh?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What even is that?</p>
<p>Well, you know...</p>
<p>I'll even hang around with this guy Duncan from under the bridge....</p>
<p>And he runs with this rough crowd and they're all into Hawaiian underground shit, you know?</p>
<p>And I made a little list of stuff that would really support that theme.</p>
<p>"Fill bar with sand.</p>
<p>Roast wild pig.</p>
<p>Invite Duncan and crew."</p>
<p>Ooh, this seems like a whole lot of work.</p>
<p>Uh, does anybody really even like surprise parties anyway?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>What the hell's the matter with you?!</p>
<p>How did you get so cynical?</p>
<p>Cynical?</p>
<p>You can't even get excited to give your friend a party!</p>
<p>I mean, giving somebody a birthday party, a surprise party is one of the greatest things you can do for him!</p>
<p>Okay, Frank.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Alright, alright, well, maybe we are being a little cynical.</p>
<p>Clearly, this means a lot to you, so, fine.</p>
<p>We'll jump on board with the party.</p>
<p>What's the plan?</p>
<p>Alright, the plan is you guys execute this list.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I am gonna take Charlie to the spa for a day to distract him.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Why do you get to spend the day at a spa while we do all the legwork?</p>
<p>Because I got these two coupons in the mail.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm pregnant, and you haven't offered me coupons or spa days or roasted pigs or surprises or any-any of those fun things.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, okay, well, in the interest of not being cynical and, you know, doing shit for other people, I'm gonna suggest that we give the two coupons to <em>Dee and she does the spa thing.</em></p>
<p>Surprise. Perfect.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Alright, cool.</p>
<p>I will take this coupon and sneak out the back so Charlie doesn't see me.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>What, what? What?</p>
<p>No, you have to take Charlie with you to the spa.</p>
<p>That's the whole thing.</p>
<p>You have to distract him.</p>
<p>Oh... shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, Frank, you might be right about us getting cynical.</p>
<p>I just, I just jumped straight to default and was gonna throw this second coupon in the trash.</p>
<p>But the Charlie thing, yep, we're doing the Charlie thing.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it. I'm on it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie!</p>
<p>Okay, hey, listen, uh, you've been really stressed, so I thought I would take you for a spa day, just you and me.</p>
<p>A what day?</p>
<p>A spa day.</p>
<p>What is this word "spa"?</p>
<p>I feel like you're starting to say a word, and you're not finishing it.</p>
<p>Are you trying to say "spaghetti"?</p>
<p>Are you taking me for a spaghetti day?</p>
<p>No, Charlie, I wasn't trying to take you for a spaghetti day.</p>
<p>Oh, God, you know what?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. It's okay.</p>
<p>That's alright.</p>
<p>I'm doing something nice here.</p>
<p>I tell you what.</p>
<p>Let's go to a movie.</p>
<p>Want to go to a movie?</p>
<p>Dee, I go to movie or a spaghetti place with you you know and ***?</p>
<p>What if I guarantee you that nobody out there will put you into a bag and bash you against a telephone pole?</p>
<p>Would that comfort you at all?</p>
<p>Nope. That's a guarantee you can't make, Dee, alright?</p>
<p>Alright, I tell you what...</p>
<p>That's why I'm building this little puppy.</p>
<p>Yeah. Don't do...</p>
<p>And no one's getting bashed.</p>
<p>Okay, I tell you what, Charlie.</p>
<p>If you don't come with me to the movie, I'm gonna take this raccoon of yours and I'm gonna bash it into a telephone pole.</p>
<p>No! I can't take any more bashing today, alright?</p>
<p>Okay, let's go, let's go.</p>
<p>This will be fun!</p>
<p>Alright, let's go.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Why don't you check that box of tiki torches, start setting those up?</p>
<p>What this?</p>
<p>Yeah, that box there.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>We didn't put this in here.</p>
<p>Surprise!</p>
<p>What is that? What'd you do?</p>
<p>I got you a present, bro!</p>
<p>I'm trying to be less cynical, and Frank is totally right.</p>
<p>The surprise is the way to go!</p>
<p>So you got me a gift?</p>
<p>Yes! Yeah, while we were picking out the decorations, I slipped out and I got you something I think you're gonna gonna like.</p>
<p>Okay, alright. Ooh!</p>
<p>Ooh! Okay. Uh!</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, a shirt!</p>
<p>I love this shirt!</p>
<p>Oh, that's great, man!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey. No, this isn't the shirt that I picked out.</p>
<p>Yeah. No. Well, no.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>It's the shirt that I... that I picked out.</p>
<p>But that's cool.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, man.</p>
<p>I-I got a little suspicious when you slipped out earlier, and so I followed you into the store, and I saw that you were about to make a really bad choice, and then you did make that choice and you bought that other shirt, and it was a bad shirt.</p>
<p>It was an ugly shirt.</p>
<p>Hideous really.</p>
<p>So I grabbed that shirt out of the bag when you weren't looking and I returned it and bought myself this shirt which isn't hideous.</p>
<p>And so, surprise.</p>
<p>That was a good shirt.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This brings me no joy at all.</p>
<p>I feel nothing.</p>
<p>I feel...</p>
<p>I feel like you just, you stole money from me, and then you bought yourself a shirt.</p>
<p>A shirt with your money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, that is what happened.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>That is a ridiculous price and you know it!</p>
<p>Supposing I bought a pig unseasoned and dressed it myself?</p>
<p>Then what? What then?!</p>
<p>Well, that's not what Jerry Carelli said, asshole!</p>
<p>Ha! Pitting two pig dealers against each other.</p>
<p>Ah, sure.</p>
<p>Frank, are you sure about this luau thing?</p>
<p>I mean, it's a ton of work.</p>
<p>Yeah. Does Charlie even know what a luau is?</p>
<p>I doubt Charlie can even say the word "luau."</p>
<p>I mean, how do you know that's what he wants?</p>
<p>Because I read it in his dream book.</p>
<p>In his what? His dream book?</p>
<p>Yeah. Charlie keeps a book of dreams and aspirations.</p>
<p>They're mostly in pictures and symbols, but he has been obsessing about this luau thing since we met Duncan under the bridge.</p>
<p>Okay, now, my first instinct: When you say things about meeting people under bridges, it's to, it's to berate you for hanging out with people under a bridge and to say to you, "Why do you hang out with these... with these people?</p>
<p>You and Charlie shouldn't be..."</p>
<p>But I'm not gonna say anything because I don't want to be cynical anymore.</p>
<p>I'm not going to say anything.</p>
<p>I'm just...</p>
<p>Maybe the bridge is exciting.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The bridge is awesome.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>It's probably pretty cool.</p>
<p>(Dennis grunting)</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Hold.</p>
<p>Hey, it's the other pig guy.</p>
<p>Ah, so you come crawling back, you cheap sack of shit.</p>
<p>Oh, you can't bring food into the theater.</p>
<p>No, I'm not. I bought it over there with that food.</p>
<p>No, you didn't.</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>Because we don't serve spaghetti... and I just watched you walk in with it.</p>
<p>You call my bluff, sir.</p>
<p>I shall dispose of this ***</p>
<p>A moment, please.</p>
<p>Dee, do me a favor and pop this in your purse real quick.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>No. Why do you have to bring spaghetti...?</p>
<p>You caught me hankering for spaghetti and I want it.</p>
<p>Just eat it, then.</p>
<p>Eat it fast and we'll go.</p>
<p>No, I want to enjoy it and watch the movie.</p>
<p>It's going to make a mess in my purse.</p>
<p>I'm leaving because the spaghetti is the whole deal for me.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. Just... Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Just put it in. Be careful.</p>
<p>You are... this is so stupid.</p>
<p>And there we go!</p>
<p>Got rid of it.</p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Look at this place, Dee.</p>
<p>Look at the size of the place.</p>
<p>What does 3-D even stand for?</p>
<p>Third dimension.</p>
<p>Just... please stop talking.</p>
<p>Third dimen...</p>
<p>What dimension are we in?</p>
<p>Shh! Charlie, I don't know.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Isn't stuff, like, supposed to pop out at us?</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Let's watch and find out, okay?</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>(Dee gasps)</p>
<p>Did you see that?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I saw that.</p>
<p>That came, like, right at you.</p>
<p>Is this safe?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Take the glasses off if you're uncomfortable, okay?</p>
<p>But then everything's, like, blurry.</p>
<p>Then put the glasses on and shut the hell up.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>You shh!</p>
<p>See, then, stuff's not safe.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What happened to my meatball?</p>
<p>Hey, would you shut up?</p>
<p>Oh, no, you know what happened?</p>
<p>When I...</p>
<p>I bet it flew off when I...</p>
<p>Okay, you are a sleuth.</p>
<p>You've gotten to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>That's very exciting.</p>
<p>Now shut up.</p>
<p>Let me just find it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, did you see a meatball...</p>
<p>Charlie, sit down.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Charlie.</p>
<p>I swear to God, if you don't sit down and shut up and watch the movie, I'm going to attack you.</p>
<p>I don't care how pregnant I am, I am going to get out of this seat, I'm going to attack you.</p>
<p>I got it, got it, got it...</p>
<p>Oh, you got it? Okay, good.</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>Got the meatball.</p>
<p>Sit down!</p>
<p>Quiet down!</p>
<p>The movie's boring.</p>
<p>You... You...!</p>
<p>How could you...</p>
<p>You're not watching the movie.</p>
<p>Ugh. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Aah, you're not gonna like this.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Ah, nuts.</p>
<p>Some-some spaghetti kind of like spilled in your purse a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Want your spaghetti, Charlie?</p>
<p>Want your spaghetti?</p>
<p>Here's your spaghetti.</p>
<p>Oh, don't dump it on the ground like that.</p>
<p>Shut up and watch the movie.</p>
<p>I don't want to shut up and watch the movie.</p>
<p>Can't eat spaghetti, can't follow the movie.</p>
<p>Doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>I'm going back to the bar.</p>
<p>Good. Good. Go to the bar.</p>
<p>I'm taking the spaghetti with me.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>(Dennis grunting)</p>
<p>Dude, I just saw another rat.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>There's definitely a ton of rats in here, that's for sure.</p>
<p>I see him! I see him!</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>We gotta distract him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll tell him the keg exploded.</p>
<p>No, that's a stupid idea.</p>
<p>That's a stupid idea.</p>
<p>We're going with the burst pipe.</p>
<p>Uh, I like the keg idea.</p>
<p>Your idea is so stupid...</p>
<p>Let's go with the burst pipe...</p>
<p>♪♪♪</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, Charlie!</p>
<p>Charlie boy!</p>
<p>Hey, where'd you get those glasses, bud?</p>
<p>Oh, these?</p>
<p>They're just, like, third dimension glasses, you know?</p>
<p>Don't really work, though, 'cause I feel like I'm still seeing stuff in whatever dimension we live in.</p>
<p>Right. Well, listen, um, you can't really go in the bar right now, bro.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, because a keg exploded.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Can that happen?</p>
<p>A piece of metal flew off the keg and hit Dennis right in the dick.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah... No, I-I'm fine.</p>
<p>I'm fine. I got lucky.</p>
<p>It mashed right into it.</p>
<p>We all thought he was gonna lose it.</p>
<p>Charlie, it lumped it up and mangled it like a chicken potpie down there.</p>
<p>Dickless Dennis.</p>
<p>That's what we should call him now... Dickless Dennis.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It's totally fine.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughing)</p>
<p>Oh, Dickless Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh, dick... But it doesn't apply because my totally went back to normal, and it's fine now.</p>
<p>I'll show it to you.</p>
<p>I don't want to see it.</p>
<p>Anyway, moving on, how was the spa?</p>
<p>Spa?</p>
<p>Oh, spaghetti?</p>
<p>How's my spaghetti?</p>
<p>Dee threw it on the floor.</p>
<p>No, no, the spa.</p>
<p>The spa that Dee took you to.</p>
<p>Oh, no, she took me to a movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was lame.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand it.</p>
<p>Made no sense.</p>
<p>That cynical bitch.</p>
<p>Hello. I would like to redeem this coupon and go ahead and toss this one in the trash for me.</p>
<p>Busted!</p>
<p>Ah, see!</p>
<p>Oh, busted, Dee.</p>
<p>You're so busted.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>I'm taking Charlie to the spa because he's stressed.</p>
<p>A keg exploded in the bar, blew Dennis's dick off.</p>
<p>No, no...</p>
<p>Oh, it's a mess down there.</p>
<p>No, my...</p>
<p>My dick is fine, Dee.</p>
<p>Let me have those coupons.</p>
<p>No, you said I can have them.</p>
<p>Dee, you were supposed to take Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tried to take Charlie, but he refused to go.</p>
<p>What is your spaghetti policy here?</p>
<p>Are you hearing this?</p>
<p>Are you hearing this?</p>
<p>He doesn't belong in a place like this, you guys.</p>
<p>Alright, come on, we're wasting time.</p>
<p>Go get Duncan and the bridge crew and bring them to the bar.</p>
<p>I'll occupy Charlie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Where's the robes?</p>
<p>I think this is it, right here.</p>
<p>This is sketchy as hell.</p>
<p>(Dennis exhales)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(knocking)</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Hey, um, yeah, we're looking for Duncan.</p>
<p>(door slams shut)</p>
<p>Oh, let's go.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we should take that as a sign, right?</p>
<p>(chain clattering)</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey.</p>
<p>You pregnant.</p>
<p>One more time.</p>
<p>What is happening in here?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Come on, no Alright, uh, Mr.</p>
<p>Duncan, we were wondering if we could talk to you about...</p>
<p>I ain't no Duncan.</p>
<p>It's this nigga right here about to go level three and shit.</p>
<p>That's Duncan.</p>
<p>Oh... you're Duncan.</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Duncan, we were wondering if you could come to a surprise party for Charlie.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>He's Frank's friend.</p>
<p>It's my understanding you guys have all been hanging out under a bridge.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Frank.</p>
<p>I know that bitch.</p>
<p>Okay, hey, listen, Frank mentioned that you might be willing to...</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Level three, son!</p>
<p>Yeah, level three!</p>
<p>This is bizarre, okay?</p>
<p>Charlie should not have anything to do with these people.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They are deranged.</p>
<p>You know what? Frank has too much influence over this whole thing, alright?</p>
<p>I think we gotta stop and think about what Charlie wants.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we need to get our hands on Charlie's dream book and we need to figure out what that kid wants ourselves.</p>
<p>(man and woman moaning)</p>
<p>Mother pus bucket.</p>
<p>You piece of shit, you broke my wall!</p>
<p>We have company here.</p>
<p>(men yelling)</p>
<p>Should we call the police?</p>
<p>Oh, you know what, let's just go, let's just go.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Let's get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>(woman continues moaning)</p>
<p>Charlie, let's go.</p>
<p>Get in here.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, the management needs everybody to get out, because they caught a guy jerking off in here and they're going to send in a crew to wipe down the loads.</p>
<p>Go ahead, go on, let's go.</p>
<p>God, it's terrible.</p>
<p>It's really disgusting.</p>
<p>Get rid of all the strange dongs.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit.</p>
<p>I don't get it, man.</p>
<p>What's so relaxing about sitting around in a hot, wet room?</p>
<p>It's all about opening up your pores, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, take your robe off.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>You got your clothes on.</p>
<p>Get your clothes off.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>I can't get naked in public.</p>
<p>Suit yourself, alright?</p>
<p>I am gonna roast like a pig.</p>
<p>OK, I'm gonna eat the spaghetti.</p>
<p>Oh, guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, this is it.</p>
<p>Dram... Dram bak...</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeah, look at this...</p>
<p>Pictures and symbols.</p>
<p>I don't see anything about our stupid luau, but, uh...</p>
<p>This looks weird.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What do you make of it, guys?</p>
<p>Looks like a drawing of a pair of jeans, a plus sign and a chicken.</p>
<p>Denim... chicken.</p>
<p>Denim chicken.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, my gut is telling me to throw this book in the trash.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>It's absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I think we're all feeling the same thing, but I think we need to fight that instinct.</p>
<p>We have to throw a party for Charlie.</p>
<p>It's so simple.</p>
<p>If we can't do that, what does that say about us?</p>
<p>You're right, you're right.</p>
<p>This isn't about us.</p>
<p>Let's not be cynical.</p>
<p>Let's do what the kid wants.</p>
<p>Yeah. If he wants a worm... hat... Worm hat.</p>
<p>Worm hat.</p>
<p>Okay, how do we get him a worm hat, 'cause I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Maybe there's a drawing, or...</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>That's a bird with teeth.</p>
<p>It sure is.</p>
<p>Okay, look, we don't have a lot of time, so let's just figure out the best we can do.</p>
<p>We can do it, we can do it.</p>
<p>Alright, we'll do these things.</p>
<p>We'll do these things, okay.</p>
<p>Dude, how much longer do we have to stay in here?</p>
<p>Come on, just relax.</p>
<p>Take your clothes off.</p>
<p>I feel trapped in here, Frank.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm trapped like a rat.</p>
<p>Holy shit, I'm trapped like a rat, aren't I?</p>
<p>No, you're not, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm a rat in here.</p>
<p>I'm a rat!</p>
<p>I'm trapped like a...</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>I got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Calm down, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm tired of being in weird places, Frank, 'cause I'm trapped like a rat.</p>
<p>Calm down, Charlie, calm down.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>Okay, alright, alright.</p>
<p>I got to get out of here!</p>
<p>Now calm down.</p>
<p>How do I get this off?</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>Charlie, no, no.</p>
<p>Take it easy, Charlie.</p>
<p>Just bash me, Frank.</p>
<p>No, I'm not going to bash you, Charlie.</p>
<p>Just bash me like a rat.</p>
<p>Bash me like a rat and get it over with.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry guys.</p>
<p>Just let me know when you're done.</p>
<p>I'm the guy who wipes down the loads.</p>
<p>I'm not wearing the stupid thing, and that's it.</p>
<p>It's a lei.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p>What the shit is this?</p>
<p>Where's my luau?</p>
<p>Well, we went around you, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Charlie.</p>
<p>Happy birthday.</p>
<p>Happy birthday?</p>
<p>Oh, is that why you guys were doing all that weird shit with me today?</p>
<p>Yeah. We were trying to distract you so we could plan your party.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's not my birthday, though.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It's not your birthday?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>No, dicks, it's my birthday.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>No, I'm not kidding you.</p>
<p>Wait, wait a second.</p>
<p>Were you trying to get us to plan your surprise party?</p>
<p>Why wouldn't you just plan it yourself?</p>
<p>Well, that's lame.</p>
<p>I mean, this way I get my surprise party and I give you the satisfaction of doing something nice for somebody.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That is not doing something nice.</p>
<p>That is tricking us.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Where's Duncan?</p>
<p>Where's Dunc...?</p>
<p>You should not be hanging out with Duncan.</p>
<p>You should not be associating people like that.</p>
<p>I'm saying, I don't care.</p>
<p>It's coming out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Those weird bridge people that are like...?</p>
<p>Yeah. All that, like, Hawwoowin lauow?</p>
<p>I knew it, I knew he couldn't say it.</p>
<p>Luau, luau.</p>
<p>Luau.</p>
<p>What is it, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, it's the weird...</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>What do we got going on over here, guys?</p>
<p>Okay, well, Charlie, when we thought it was your birthday, we went through your dream book and we tried to recreate some of the stuff we found in there.</p>
<p>Yes, that's... okay.</p>
<p>Um... denim chicken?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p>Denim chicken.</p>
<p>Now I got to reroute the pig delivery.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I'm assuming the teeth are fake, yes?</p>
<p>Yes, well, they're not real human teeth if that's what you're asking.</p>
<p>No, I mean, did you discover a bird with teeth in this fashion?</p>
<p>That does not exist in nature.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that.</p>
<p>But either way, good glue work.</p>
<p>Do any of you assholes want to know how old I am?</p>
<p>Whatever, Frank.</p>
<p>Nobody... Alright so...</p>
<p>So, Charlie, this is my favorite part.</p>
<p>We weren't quite sure what a worm hat was, right?</p>
<p>So we made a few of them.</p>
<p>This is the first one.</p>
<p>It's a hat made of worms, okay?</p>
<p>And then option number two is a hat that you put on and if you do that you look like maybe you're a worm.</p>
<p>Right...And then the third one... and this is the best one, Charlie... is a hat for your worm.</p>
<p>Oh, your teeny tiny little worm gets a teeny tiny little hat. If you want him to be fancy.</p>
<p>So which was is it? Which one were you talking about? Yeah, who's right?</p>
<p>Well, I don't recall every writing worm hat.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was in your dream book. Your...</p>
<p>Oh... </p>
<p>(with German accent): "Wormhat."</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a German guy.</p>
<p>His name is Hans Wormhat.</p>
<p>He appears in my dreams.</p>
<p>He drive a biplane and he shoots it at me and I run through a field.</p>
<p>You know what, you guys blow.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go find Duncan.</p>
<p>Go, go!</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Guys, wow, the denim chicken, the bird with teeth, Wormhat's worm hat.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't know what to say, man.</p>
<p>This is just what I needed today.</p>
<p>Guess what, buddy?</p>
<p>There's one more thing.</p>
<p>Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p>That's a new rat stick, dude.</p>
<p>And you can bash up a whole bunch of rats with one quick strike, so it's more humane.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Well, what do you...?</p>
<p>Oh, you like it?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>(voice breaking): I love it.</p>
<p>I mean...</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say, 'cause no one's ever really, um...</p>
<p>I don't know what to say, guys.</p>
<p>You don't have to say anything, man.</p>
<p>Maybe I could give it a quick whirl around the basement and see if I can kill a couple rats.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>You've earned it.</p>
<p>You should, you should.</p>
<p>Go bash 'em up, buddy.</p>
<p>(Charlie laughing)</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>(all sigh)</p>
<p>What a life.</p>
