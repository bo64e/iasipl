<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us.</p>
<p>Yes, this shouldn't take long.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>You'd like to buy a boat.</p>
<p>Yes, we have recently come into a considerable amount of money.</p>
<p>Now I'm not gonna bore you with details, but let's just say that my friends here set up for a *** adventure... </p>
<p>***.com.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually we're not supposed to talk about...</p>
<p>That's true but...</p>
<p>Yeah, technically we're doing a couple of things in the hush hush from Uncle Sam...</p>
<p>The point is we're flush.</p>
<p>We are 25 hundred dollars flush.</p>
<p>So don't worry about that.</p>
<p>So we'd like to take some of that money and taste a bit of the high life.</p>
<p>We've also talked to our friend here into throwing  his entire life savings into the venture.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>You see, I'm in it for the lifestyle as well as the great investment.</p>
<p>Okay, well, then what is it you guys are looking for?</p>
<p>Let's talk needs, please?</p>
<p>I'd like to talk needs first.</p>
<p>Now I have the need for speed.</p>
<p>It's very important, it's inherent, there's nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>So speed is a must.</p>
<p>Absolutely, but we are also looking to entertain guests upon this boat, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, we're gonna throw some P. Diddy-style parties up on the deck.</p>
<p>Um, can we talk shrimp for a minute?</p>
<p>I'd like the boat to be able to haul in a tremendous amount of shrimp.</p>
<p>Sort of a Forrest Gump-size amount of shrimp.</p>
<p>Um, you should be writing this down, I think.</p>
<p>Why are you not writing this down?</p>
<p>Oh, let me just see if I have this right here.</p>
<p>Please, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>It seems what you guys are looking for is some sort of P. Diddy-style shrimping vessel.</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>You're a really good listener, and I didn't peg you for one when I walked in here 'cause of the pinky ring, but that's great.</p>
<p>You know, I've got just the boat for you.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Well, here she is, The Drowning Sailor.</p>
<p>It, uh, doesn't meet, well, uh, any of your specs.</p>
<p>Look, I'm gonna level with you, pal.</p>
<p>We... we saw this coming a mile away, and we've had our hearts set on this boat thing for days now, which, in our world, is a level of focus in which I personally have never experienced.</p>
<p>But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and I'm gonna say... We'll take it!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What-what-what are you doing?</p>
<p>I was-I was doing a thing.</p>
<p>You were taking a long time, dude.</p>
<p>You're taking way too long.</p>
<p>We wanted to buy a boat.</p>
<p>Let's get the boat.</p>
<p>I was taking a little while because I was doing a little presentation...</p>
<p>Dennis, what if someone walks down the deck and makes an offer before us?</p>
<p>Nobody's gonna make an offer before I finish my thing.</p>
<p>They might have.</p>
<p>We're not the only people in town that want...</p>
<p>I'm confused.</p>
<p>Are you gonna take the boat or not?</p>
<p>Yes, we're taking the boat.</p>
<p>We're buying the boat.</p>
<p>We want to add a little fanfare into the situation.</p>
<p>My friends here, they couldn't wait for that.</p>
<p>Yes, we're-we're taking the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: What a score!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Houseboat, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely...</p>
<p>Well, the houseboat offers all the advantages of a house, but with the excitement of the sea.</p>
<p>Think of all the fish we're gonna catch.</p>
<p>It's not just fish, Frank.</p>
<p>You gotta start thinking about shrimp, okay?</p>
<p>Oh-oh-oh.</p>
<p>We're gonna be hauling in so much shrimp every day, it's gonna pay for itself ten times over.</p>
<p>Picture tiny shrimp crawling all over this boat.</p>
<p>Every inch of it...</p>
<p>Guys...</p>
<p>Can we not focus on the shrimp cause we have so much work to do.</p>
<p>It's a shrimp boat.</p>
<p>I'd like to have at least one conversation about shrimp.</p>
<p>No. No, shrimp is a very small aspect of the whole...</p>
<p>Most important part of the...</p>
<p>No, you know what?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Shrimp or no shrimp, I'm very excited about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I say we take this little lady onto the sea and get loaded.</p>
<p>Well, slow your roll there, Dee.</p>
<p>The lady's not quite ready to go out to the sea yet.</p>
<p>There's a lot of prep work that still has to be done.</p>
<p>So, actually, Frank and Charlie, I want you to start by scraping the barnacles off the bottom of the boat, 'cause that probably hasn't been done in years, while Dee and Mac and I go in to the inside and check out the decor situation, you know?</p>
<p>One word.</p>
<p>Shrimp.</p>
<p>(sliding door squeaking)</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>No, just as I suspected, we got our work cut out for us, guys.</p>
<p>This isn't Diddyesque at all.</p>
<p>No, no, we gotta get rid of all this shit.</p>
<p>Are you guys crazy?</p>
<p>This boat is awesome.</p>
<p>How about a little of this?</p>
<p>(music playing)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>This?</p>
<p>That's my P. Diddy boat dance.</p>
<p>Uh!</p>
<p>You look like one of this inflatable dancing things at the used car lot.</p>
<p>The ones that flail around in the wind.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>I look good.</p>
<p>No, Dee, that's exactly what you look like.</p>
<p>I promise you that's what you look like.</p>
<p>You can't dance for shit!</p>
<p>I can dance, and you don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>I'm gonna bring one of those in so you can see it.</p>
<p>Okay, why don't you bring the guy in, we'll have a dance competition?</p>
<p>I'm gonna be the judge of that contest!</p>
<p>I'm gonna show...!</p>
<p>There's not gonna be a contest!</p>
<p>Stop! Everybody stop! Shut up!</p>
<p>No, nobody's bringing any trashy inflatable man on this boat.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Dee, stop dancing.</p>
<p>(music stops)</p>
<p>You look like an asshole.</p>
<p>We're not there yet.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work to do first.</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, since you didn't invest any money in this venture, you're gonna be the one that's got to do all the hard labor here.</p>
<p>So I need you to get rid of all this shit, and make the boat look nice, okay?</p>
<p>Whoa-whoa-whoa.</p>
<p>Hard work?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Work first, and then you can do your weird inflatable tube-man P. Diddy dance.</p>
<p>Or whatever it is.</p>
<p>You know what I'm looking forward to?</p>
<p>Is catching me some Delaware River catfish.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>They are so tasty!</p>
<p>I used to eat 'em when I was a kid.</p>
<p>You can't buy 'em in the stores no more.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>The goddamned EPA.</p>
<p>They says they're toxic.</p>
<p>(blows raspberry) Toxic my ass.</p>
<p>I mean, they're just endangered.</p>
<p>They're tasty, man.</p>
<p>Frank. this boat is the best investment I ever made, man.</p>
<p>I mean, it's huge!</p>
<p>We're gonna pop over to the boat store real quick and grab some, uh...</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing?</p>
<p>We're loading our gear.</p>
<p>No, no, no. You should not be loading.</p>
<p>No one should be bringing anything onto the boat.</p>
<p>You should be scraping, okay?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, scrape.</p>
<p>Oh, well, we're gonna scrape the boat.</p>
<p>We are gonna scrape the boat.</p>
<p>Are you patronizing me?</p>
<p>Don't patronize me.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>No one's patronizing you, all right?</p>
<p>Here's what we'll do: we'll scrape all these little delicious oysters or whatever off the side of the boat.</p>
<p>We'll put 'em in a pot, we'll boil 'em up for before you get back.</p>
<p>We'll cook 'em for you.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>No, those are barnacles.</p>
<p>Do not eat those.</p>
<p>Do not cook them in a pot and serve them to us.</p>
<p>Okay, all that.</p>
<p>Honestly, don't eat those.</p>
<p>You'll get very, very sick, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now that is a direct order from your captain.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Since when are you the captain?</p>
<p>Well, clearly I'm the captain.</p>
<p>Who else would be the captain.</p>
<p>I feel like I would be the captain.</p>
<p>Dennis?</p>
<p>I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>I'm captain! I call it!</p>
<p>Locked in. Boom.</p>
<p>Scrape. Let's go.</p>
<p>(Charlie groans)</p>
<p>Let's go. Let's go.</p>
<p>I ain't scraping shit.</p>
<p>No, we're not scraping!</p>
<p>No, no scraping.</p>
<p>Here's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>We're gonna fire up the boat, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're gonna take it out on the ocean, we're gonna get some oysters. And shrimp.</p>
<p>And shrimpies!</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Toss me the keys.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Well, it's the keys.</p>
<p>I threw 'em right at ya.</p>
<p>I asked you to toss 'em!</p>
<p>You threw 'em overhand!</p>
<p>That's the way I throw!</p>
<p>Jump in there and get 'em.</p>
<p>I'm not going in there.</p>
<p>I don't sink.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I get in there, I just bob around like a cauliflower.</p>
<p>Don't give me lines, man.</p>
<p>Jump in the ocean and get the damn keys!</p>
<p>No, I'm not going in.</p>
<p>(blubbering)</p>
<p>Charlie, I'm not going in.</p>
<p>It's your boat. You go on in.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>(whistling tune)</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Uh, I got us some turpentine, some wax and some high-gloss boat paint.</p>
<p>This shit is really expensive.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, you're telling me.</p>
<p>I picked us up some new slacks and docksiders so we could have the right look, you know, and fit in and everything.</p>
<p>We're running pretty low on remaining dick towel money though.</p>
<p>Plus, we got to fill that thing up with gas, and... I know, man.</p>
<p>We got to pop by the department store, pick up the mattress.</p>
<p>I want to get a nice one, too.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>The what? The mattress?</p>
<p>What do we need a mattress for?</p>
<p>What do you mean what do we need a mattress for?</p>
<p>Why in the hell do you think we just spent all that money on a boat?</p>
<p>The whole purpose of buying the boat in the first place was to get the ladies nice and tipsy topside, so we can take them to a nice comfortable place below deck and, you know, they can't refuse.</p>
<p>Because of the implication.</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, okay.</p>
<p>You had me going for the first part, but the second half kind of threw me.</p>
<p>Well, dude, dude, think about it.</p>
<p>She's out in the middle of nowhere with some dude she barely knows.</p>
<p>She looks around and what does she see?</p>
<p>Nothing but open ocean.</p>
<p>"Ah, there's nowhere for me to run.</p>
<p>What am I going to do, say no?"</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>That seems really dark.</p>
<p>No, it's not dark.</p>
<p>You're misunderstanding me, bro.</p>
<p>I think I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are.</p>
<p>Because if the girl said no, then the answer obviously is no.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But the thing is, she's not going to say no.</p>
<p>She would never say no, because of the implication.</p>
<p>Now... you said that word "implication" a couple of times.</p>
<p>What... what implication?</p>
<p>The implication that things might go wrong for her if she refuses to sleep with me.</p>
<p>You know, not that things are going to go wrong for her, but she's thinking that they will.</p>
<p>But it sounds like she doesn't want to have sex with you.</p>
<p>Why aren't you understanding this?</p>
<p>I don't... She doesn't know whether she wants to have sex with me.</p>
<p>She doesn't know?</p>
<p>That's not the issue.</p>
<p>Are you going to hurt women?</p>
<p>I'm not going to hurt these women.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Why would I ever hurt these women?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I feel like you're not getting this at all.</p>
<p>I'm not getting it.</p>
<p>Goddamn.</p>
<p>Don't you look at me like that.</p>
<p>You certainly wouldn't be in any danger.</p>
<p>So they are in danger?</p>
<p>No one's in any danger.</p>
<p>How can I make that any more clear to you?</p>
<p>Okay, it's an implication of danger.</p>
<p>You know what, just drop it.</p>
<p>Let's drop it.</p>
<p>Buy your shit and let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie, you got 'em?</p>
<p>No keys. Can't find 'em.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I found a couple cool things.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I got a tooth.</p>
<p>Ooh, look at that.</p>
<p>It's like a horse's tooth or something.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And look at this bullet.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>This is a war relic.</p>
<p>This could be valuable.</p>
<p>What the hell happened down there?</p>
<p>Some kind of horse massacre?</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Could be, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dude, there's so much cool shit down there, I'm gonna keep diving looking for it.</p>
<p>I need a flashlight 'cause it's dark.</p>
<p>Flashlight coming up.</p>
<p>Just toss it to me real quick.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>I throw overhand, Charlie.</p>
<p>(clattering)</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>

<p>What the hell are you doing in here?</p>

<p>Well, this is a shit hole, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe we should gut it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's see...</p>
<p>Ooh, ah, here we go.</p>
<p>Now, let's see.</p>
<p>Start with this beautiful baby here.</p>

<p>Whoa, Christ.</p>
<p>Think about, like, all the movies and the books and all the stories of all the terrible awful, awful things that have happened out in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>You know, that's the stuff that's, like, rattling around in her head, informing her decision as to whether she sleeps with me or not.</p>
<p>That's all I'm saying.</p>
<p>It's not like a big thing, or...</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Look, I need you to understand this, okay?</p>
<p>You're making it seem like I'm some sort of monster or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Hey, wha... what is going on in there?</p>
<p>Like this?</p>
<p>It's more like a rolling sway.</p>
<p>Like this. There you go.</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing in here?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, what the hell did you do to our boat?!</p>
<p>Uh, we were cleaning it.</p>
<p>(music stops)</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, what's that all about?</p>
<p>You're just breaking everything in this boat.</p>
<p>You were supposed to be fixing it up and making it look nice.</p>
<p>Crew meeting! Crew meeting!</p>
<p>Where is Charlie?</p>
<p>He's in the water.</p>
<p>What is he doing in the water?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Aw, dude, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, hey, guys, come here.</p>
<p>You are not going to believe how much cool shit is under the boat.</p>
<p>There's like a whole world of ancient stuff.</p>
<p>There was a horse massacre, right, in the Revolutionary times, and then there's like a pirate ship.</p>
<p>Like, I found all these old pretty little dolls.</p>
<p>No. - Maybe like a brush, like a pirate is brushing his hair...</p>
<p>Killed the horse and then jumped in the ocean?</p>
<p>Goddamn it, I've been cleaning up in there for hours throwing this shit overboard and you're just dragging it all back up.</p>
<p>You've been dumping the trash in the ocean?</p>
<p>Why-why-why are you swimming in the water in the first place?</p>
<p>He dropped the keys in the water.</p>
<p>I did not... All right, first of all, he threw the keys at me overhand.</p>
<p>You should have seen this throw.</p>
<p>We leave you guys alone for 45 minutes and you destroy the interior of the boat, you lose the keys...</p>
<p>I can get those keys.</p>
<p>I just need you guys to buy me some scuba equipment so I can stay down there longer.</p>
<p>Do you realize how much money scuba equipment costs?</p>
<p>No. Rent the cheap stuff.</p>
<p>Just rent some cheap stuff, all right?</p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll clear all this stuff off... we'll start to paint, all right?</p>
<p>By the time you guys come back, I promise you, I promise, the boat will be looking better.</p>
<p>I can't tell.</p>
<p>Is he patronizing me again?</p>
<p>I can't...</p>
<p>I can't even tell anymore.</p>
<p>No, no, what he's saying is really stupid, but it's sincere, okay? It's sincere this time.</p>
<p>I think you're just a little sensitive to it.</p>
<p>Sorry, Charlie.</p>
<p>(mocking tone): I'm sorry, too.</p>
<p>That was patronizing!</p>
<p>You can't patronize your captain.</p>
<p>That's a sea law.</p>
<p>Yo, dude.</p>
<p>You realize how much boating equipment costs?</p>
<p>It's crazy, it's astronomical.</p>
<p>I can't believe how much they charge for this shit.</p>
<p>You know, Dee, Frank and Charlie are driving me crazy.</p>
<p>We're spending all of our dick towel money and they're throwing keys into the water and losing everything...</p>
<p>And you're not even listening to me.</p>
<p>No, I heard you.</p>
<p>You said a bunch of words, right?</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It's like some kind of dock party mixer, dude.</p>
<p>It's a flyer.</p>
<p>Look at these chicks.</p>
<p>And an anchor.</p>
<p>Dude, that's what we need to be doing.</p>
<p>We need to be mixing it up at mixers with other boat people and living the lifestyle.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>And then we'll be back in the high life again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like Stevie Nicks.</p>
<p>That's actually Steve Winwood.</p>
<p>Right. Same dude, right?</p>
<p>It's not the same dude.</p>
<p>Actually, one's not even a dude.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I love that song.</p>
<p>Let's buy that CD.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I love that song, too.</p>
<p>That's why I already own the CD.</p>
<p>I own all of Steve Winwood's shit.</p>
<p>You should know this.</p>
<p>And secondly, we have not been on the same page all day.</p>
<p>We can't be spending money on CDs that I already own.</p>
<p>We're spending too much money as it is.</p>
<p>It's bad enough I let you buy that stupid inflatable guy from the car lot.</p>

<p>Look at you... fighting with a green guy.</p>
<p>Dudes, you're never going to believe what I just found floating off the end of the boat.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm scraping those little delicious oysters off the bottom, right?</p>
<p>Why is this turned off?</p>
<p>You're back.</p>
<p>You don't even... Well, well, I got to say, guys, I'm very impressed.</p>
<p>The boat's really starting to come along.</p>
<p>I didn't think you guys had it in you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's a couple more brushes here and a little paint.</p>
<p>Get to work, we'll do the trim and then we'll be done.</p>
<p>Us?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We're not going to be doing any of that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You're not going to be doing any of that?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>We're not going to be doing any of the work.</p>
<p>That's-that's what you guys are doing.</p>
<p>That was the whole deal.</p>
<p>No, we got a party to get ready for.</p>
<p>Yeah, so... We're going to do all the work while you guys go to a party?</p>
<p>We got to socialize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I could socialize.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Not looking like you're looking.</p>
<p>You're covered in paint and dirt and grime and all kinds of shit, so...</p>
<p>You're skin looks like leather and you got blisters all over you.</p>
<p>You guys look absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Well, we're out of here.</p>
<p>So, Charlie, there's your, uh, there's your scuba gear.</p>
<p>Find the keys.</p>
<p>Just find 'em.</p>
<p>Oh, guys... keep up the good work.</p>
<p>See, now they flipped it around.</p>
<p>They're patronizing us.</p>
<p>Absolutely patronizing us, Frank.</p>
<p>That's right, they're patronizing...</p>
<p>But don't take it to heart, buddy, 'cause I got something that's going to cheer you up.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Guess who found the keys.</p>
<p>The keys!</p>
<p>You found the keys!</p>
<p>Dude, they were just floating under the boat.</p>
<p>They got a little floaty thing on them.</p>
<p>This is amazing, by the way... these floaty things.</p>
<p>We should patent this.</p>
<p>Okay, I think this is it.</p>
<p>Now this is much more our speed.</p>
<p>These are the kind of people we should be hanging out with.</p>
<p>Man, now this is a boat.</p>
<p>(country music playing)</p>
<p>Ahoy, ahoy.</p>
<p>Hi, hi.</p>
<p>A couple of fellow yachters.</p>
<p>Saw your flyer at the boat store...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Do we have the wrong yacht?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, come on in and grab a drink.</p>
<p>We're just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Let's just...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, this isn't the crowd I was expecting.</p>
<p>These guys are more barnacle covered and sunburned than Dee and Frank.</p>
<p>Let's not rush to judgment, okay?</p>
<p>These are real men of the sea.</p>
<p>Maybe this whole thing isn't about meeting girls.</p>
<p>Maybe it's about having an adventure, you know, an open ocean adventure.</p>
<p>Take a look at this guy.</p>
<p>How'd he lose that hand?</p>
<p>I bet you it was some kind of crazy adventure, right?</p>
<p>Let's find out.</p>
<p>Hey, bro, how'd you lose that hand?</p>
<p>Diabetes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Um, that's not, uh, much of an adventure, is it?</p>
<p>Kind of tragic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, we'll let you get back to...</p>
<p>We're just going to go over to the bar and grab a drink.</p>
<p>I'd offer to pour you a drink, but you probably can't drink though with the... diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Look, you know what, I was wrong, dude.</p>
<p>This is a bummer.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a major bummer.</p>
<p>Let's get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, guys, thanks for everything.</p>
<p>I think we're just going to take off, though.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, don't do that.</p>
<p>We're just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>We're going to set sail soon, and we're going to have a couple of tasty treats out there.</p>
<p>It's going to get nuts out there, fellas, right?</p>
<p>(men agreeing)</p>
<p>We're going to be out on open ocean, right?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Anything can happen out there.</p>
<p>No laws, right, boys?</p>
<p>Just us and our tasty treats.</p>
<p>That was an implication, right?</p>
<p>That was definitely the implication.</p>
<p>Tasty treats?</p>
<p>Are we the tasty treats?</p>
<p>We're the tasty treats in the scenario.</p>
<p>Yes, we're the tasty treats.</p>
<p>They're going to take us out into the open ocean... they're going to have their way with us, Mac.</p>
<p>We got to get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Is this how you wanted those poor women to feel?</p>
<p>No. You know what, I don't enjoy having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>I feel like you're lumping me in with them.</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.</p>
<p>(hooting)</p>
<p>The ladies have arrived.</p>
<p>♪ I'll be back in the high life again All the doors I closed one time ♪<br />
♪ Will open up again I'll be back in the high life again... ♪</p>
<p>Oh, Frank, you are absolutely right.</p>
<p>This is boat music.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the kind of music you ought to listen to.</p>
<p>I am learning some amazing moves from this guy.</p>
<p>(Frank laughing)</p>
<p>Yeah, you're doing great.</p>
<p>You got the moves.</p>
<p>Anybody want any more catfish?</p>
<p>Yo, dude, definitely give me another one of those.</p>
<p>They're delicious.</p>
<p>And you can taste that sort of endangered tang.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Oh, hold on.</p>
<p>I'm getting a call.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, Charlie, did you guys ever find those keys?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, I did actually.</p>
<p>I did. Can you believe that.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>I need you to grab Frank and Dee and get the hell out of there because we're going to be bringing back a couple of tasty treats, if you know what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Hey, man, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I'll get right on that.</p>
<p>That's how you patronize someone right there.</p>
<p>What, what, what, what, what, what?</p>
<p>Dennis being a dick.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, man.</p>
<p>Hey, this scuba equipment's broken.</p>
<p>It's useless.</p>
<p>The hell with it.</p>
<p>Let's get back to shrimping.</p>
<p>I'm gonna toss this shit.</p>
<p>It's crap anyway.</p>
<p>(electrical crackling)</p>
<p>Ooh, that's not good.</p>
<p>Uh, hey, um, what do you do if the boat is on fire?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>The boat is on fire.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, fire's getting bigger.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Fire's getting bigger.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Fire's getting big.</p>
<p>Bail!</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Find some water.</p>
<p>Find some water?!</p>
<p>Find some water.</p>
<p>What do you mean find some water?</p>
<p>There's water everywhere.</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Help us.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to get you ladies out into the sea.</p>
<p>It's so much more romantic in the middle of nowhere where we can be completely alone, and you can make rash decisions based on fear.</p>
<p>Right, Dennis?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>(coughing)</p>
<p>I thought we told you guys to beat it.</p>
<p>Out of my way.</p>
<p>No more Diddy boat.</p>
<p>Damn catfish nipping at my heels all the w...</p>
<p>Endangered my ass.</p>
<p>There's a billion of them out there.</p>
<p>Ugh. What the hell happened?</p>
<p>That was a hell of a swim.</p>
<p>Charlie, where's the boat?</p>
<p>What happened to the boat?</p>
<p>It's right there.</p>
<p>This was a terrible investment.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
