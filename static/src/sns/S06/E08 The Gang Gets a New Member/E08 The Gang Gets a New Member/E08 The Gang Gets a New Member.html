<p><strong>Frank</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>♪ Butt, butt, butt ♪</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I could watch him do that for hours.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: ♪ Open up the time capsule. ♪</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>What is the time capsule butt-butt?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: We're about to open this time capsule that we buried ten years ago.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah. (grunts)</p>
<p>What'd you put in there?</p>
<p>Oh, man, we just put a bunch of stuff in here that we thought would be valuable one day, like, uh, let's see, we got a Gregg Jeffries baseball card.</p>
<p>Future All-Star, future All-Star.</p>
<p>It wasn't valuable then.</p>
<p>Uh, we got a Korn CD.</p>
<p>Uh, we got a copy of Cider House Rules on laser disc.</p>
<p>Don't know why we thought that would be valuable.</p>
<p>That's a collector's item.</p>
<p>That's gonna be very... Be very careful with that.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you guys, this is a letter to my future self.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Yeah. "Dear future Dee, How's Hollywood?</p>
<p>Congrats on all of your success.</p>
<p>Stay grounded.</p>
<p>Enclosed is a check for one million dollars.</p>
<p>Be sure to give it to Dr.</p>
<p>Larry Myers as a thank you for all of his inspiration."</p>
<p>Is this stupid?</p>
<p>This is just stupid.</p>
<p>Who's Dr. Larry Myers?</p>
<p>Nobody. Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Just my high school drama teacher.</p>
<p>This is just... it's dumb.</p>
<p>Like, why would we put such stupid stuff in here, and also we bur-buried it, and then we opened it ten years later?</p>
<p>What, are you supposed to just, oh, bury it, open right up, and not give yourself any time to fulfill any kind of dreams or...</p>
<p>The whole thing's dumb.</p>
<p>Like, Cider House Rules?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hormones.</p>
<p>She's all worked out.</p>
<p>It's the fattening.</p>
<p>What else is in there?</p>
<p>Uh, oh!</p>
<p>Old pictures! Old pictures!</p>
<p>Pictures!</p>
<p>Holy shit, look at that!</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>The gang.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>Who's this jag-off?</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Oh, that's Schmidty!</p>
<p>Schmidty!</p>
<p>He was the fourth member of our crew.</p>
<p>There was another member of the gang?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, dude.</p>
<p>I miss him, dude.</p>
<p>Why did we ditch him in the first place?</p>
<p>I can't remember.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Eh, he wasn't a good fit.</p>
<p>Remember? You know?</p>
<p>Kind of got on our nerves.</p>
<p>He didn't get on my nerves.</p>
<p>No, he never got on my nerves.</p>
<p>I actually really loved that guy.</p>
<p>You know what, I remember now.</p>
<p>Charlie soured on him, and then he, like, gave us an ultimatum.</p>
<p>You remember?</p>
<p>And then we all turned on th guy pretty quickly...</p>
<p>I mean, we all agreed he was out of the... You pushed him out of a moving car and yelled "You're out of the gang!"</p>
<p>Now, in hindsight, that does seem a little rash.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a bit of a snap decision.</p>
<p>Why don't you call this Schmidty guy up and see what he's up to now?</p>
<p>You know, I do feel like we owe the guy an apology.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what, I'd love to see Schmidty.</p>
<p>I would, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's a bad snap decision, you know?</p>
<p>Like, there's a reason he didn't work out.</p>
<p>We got a good thing going on now without him.</p>
<p>We don't need a new member of the gang.</p>
<p>Don't get Schmidty.</p>
<p>Don't get Schmidty.</p>
<p>I'm really *** to meet this guy.</p>
<p>Oh, he was the coolest.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schmidt, it's it's Dennis.</p>
<p>And Mac. You remember us, right?</p>
<p>We're looking for Schmidty. He around?</p>
<p>He's dead.</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, that is too bad.</p>
<p>We're sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>Hiyah!</p>
<p>What's up bitches?</p>
<p>That's Schmidty?</p>
<p>Hey, we thought that you were dead.</p>
<p>He made me say it.</p>
<p>I made you say it. listen to you, mom.</p>
<p>You seen that shit?</p>
<p>He jumped down a whole flight of stairs.</p>
<p>I didn't see you down there, Chuckles.</p>
<p>How you been, little man?</p>
<p>Not that little, you know?</p>
<p>Regular size.</p>
<p>Maybe he, but...</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Put on a few LB's since I saw you last, huh?</p>
<p>No. Same weight.</p>
<p>Same weight I always been.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, he put on a lot of weight.</p>
<p>No, you tacked on weight.</p>
<p>I tacked on mass, muscle mass.</p>
<p>Who's this old son of a bitch?</p>
<p>I'm Frank.</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>I'm Schmidty.</p>
<p>Nice to... put her there.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Don't kiss him.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, so what brings you dicks here, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, well, Schmidty, um, honestly, we came around here because we, um...</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>...want to say we're sorry, Schmidty.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we... Can you take this, Mac?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, I got this.</p>
<p>Hey, man, we just want to say we're sorry for icing you out in the past, and we'd like your forgiveness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get on your knees and ask.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Get down on your knees and ask.</p>
<p>Show some humility, for Christ's sake.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, man.</p>
<p>Whatever it takes, Schmidty.</p>
<p>Wow, you're really doing it.</p>
<p>I'm kidding.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Oh, oh, he's joking!</p>
<p>Oh, man!</p>
<p>Come on, guys, have some dignity, some respect for yourselves.</p>
<p>You forgive us?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Classy, Schmidty.</p>
<p>Very classy.</p>
<p>(school bell ringing)</p>
<p>Dr. Myers?</p>
<p><strong>Myers</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds.</p>
<p>I was in the school musical.</p>
<p>Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Yes, of course!</p>
<p>Deandra Reynolds!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Sit, darling, sit.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Listen, I came to talk to you about high school.</p>
<p>I... Oh, uh... (clears throat)</p>
<p>I was drinking a lot back then, so if I did anything inappropriate...</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite.</p>
<p>You were, like, the most inspiring teacher I had.</p>
<p>In fact, I-I wrote you this check ten years ago.</p>
<p>In hopes that I can one day give it to you, as a thank you.</p>
<p>May you rot in hell, you retched beast!</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Um, I'm confused...</p>
<p>Frankenstein.</p>
<p>That's what the villagers screamed at you, just before you threw yourself at the funeral pier.</p>
<p>Aah.</p>
<p>You were such a hideous delight in that show.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>So you're saying "don't give up", I shouldn't give up on my dream.</p>
<p>No my dear, you must give up. You must.</p>
<p>It's far too late for you.</p>
<p>But it's not too late to teach.</p>
<p>Come speak to the kids, inspire them.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to share your unique experiences.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>The question is: Will you seize it?</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Five...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>...four, three...</p>
<p>No, I just never wanted to be teaching. two, one...</p>
<p>No offense.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Okay, yes.</p>
<p>And there you have it!</p>
<p>A teacher is born.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Man, this is unbelievable, huh?</p>
<p>Working at a bar, running a bar?</p>
<p>This has got to be, like, the greatest job ever, right?</p>
<p>It is, man, this is what we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, lot of dicking around, huh?</p>
<p>Hey, um, you're still, uh, living with your mom, huh?</p>
<p>That sounds kind of lame.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, it's the MS that's really lame.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Oh, your mom has...?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>She's doing all right, though.</p>
<p>I moved in with her to take care of her and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It's good to really get to know her before, you know, uh, she moves on.</p>
<p>Oh... Kind of a downer, that story, though.</p>
<p>Kind of a downer.</p>
<p>What about you, man?</p>
<p>What's your living situation like these days?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>What are you up to?</p>
<p>Uh, it's pretty sweet.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I'm his living situation.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, we share a bed.</p>
<p>Well, not every night.</p>
<p>That's hilarious.</p>
<p>You know, Charlie and I used to be roomies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you remember that?</p>
<p>Hey, you remember how you used to try to get me to play all those-those lame games, you know, those weird things you'd want to do at night?</p>
<p>Like, uh, Night Crawlers.</p>
<p>I play Night Crawlers all the time.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Frank enjoys this game very much.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but to make Night Crawlers a little bit better you should use blankets, right?</p>
<p>You take a piece of dirt.</p>
<p>Exactly, you can use it as a force field, or as a roaming base.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's kind of a good idea cause, you know, it's an imagination based game.</p>
<p>It's still imagination based.</p>
<p>Oh, I have an idea.</p>
<p>Dennis, remember you and Mac were laughing when I did the butt dance?</p>
<p>They love that when I do it.</p>
<p>Guys, watch me, watch me, will you?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>

<p>Beautiful, man.</p>
<p>Schmitdy, know what you got?</p>
<p>You know what you got that Charlie doesn't really quite have?</p>
<p>You have that "it" factor.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>It's charisma.</p>
<p>It's, like, you got it.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys!</p>
<p>Uh, can I talk to you in the back office for a second real quick?</p>
<p>I can't believe this dude.</p>
<p>He has not changed in years, man.</p>
<p>Look, you guys need to make a decision right now, okay?</p>
<p>It is either him, or it is me.</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was going to say him, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, him, him.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, it's always been him.</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't see that before.</p>
<p>I'm out of the gang?</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>Hi, there.</p>
<p>My name is Dee Reynolds, and not only am I a professional actress and comedienne, uh, but I also used to go to school here.</p>
<p>What have you acted in?</p>
<p>A lot of... a lot.</p>
<p>I've acted in a lot of things.</p>
<p>You-you may not have seen all of them or any of them.</p>
<p>You know, it's not time for questions.</p>
<p>I'll let you know when it's time for questions, though, ok?</p>
<p>And the phone goes away.</p>
<p>And the phone goes into your pocket or into your backpack, but not out, in your fingers, because I'm talking.</p>
<p>No, I'm a'ight.</p>
<p>Yeah, said the turkey.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>(laughing): Oh, no.</p>
<p>Who's she?</p>
<p>Who's she?</p>
<p>She's somebody that'll zing you back, right?</p>
<p>I'll zing you.</p>
<p>I'll zap you, I'll zing you, so just know that about me.</p>
<p>(students coughing)</p>
<p>You know, I know that, uh, you guys are 18 and you're seniors, and so...</p>
<p>Okay, what is it that they're doing?</p>
<p>What is this that they're doing?</p>
<p>Oh, they're doing their coughing thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hear that.</p>
<p>All right, kids, settle down.</p>
<p>You can, uh, read, pull out your phones, whatever.</p>
<p>They do love their phones.</p>
<p>What...? That's it?</p>
<p>You're just going to sit in the corner and hem away at your sock all day?</p>
<p>No, where... where is the teacher that I knew?</p>
<p>Where is that inspirational man?</p>
<p>My enthusiasm in those days was fueled entirely by the alcohol.</p>
<p>(Charlie whistles)</p>
<p>Dee, hey!</p>
<p>Come here, come here.</p>
<p>Charlie, what are you... what are you doing?</p>
<p>Got kicked out of the gang.</p>
<p>What are you up to?</p>
<p>You want to hang out?</p>
<p>No, Charlie.</p>
<p>I don't want to hang out.</p>
<p>I-I have a job.</p>
<p>I'm a teacher now, so I got to get back to inspiring some students.</p>
<p>Oh, that's pretty sweet.</p>
<p>You want to toss some inspiration my way, you know, 'cause the guys think Schmidty's all that and, like, I'm no good?</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie, how about this?</p>
<p>You are really good at cleaning shit out of toilets and-and taking trash and throwing it into dumpsters, so why don't you get a new job somewhere else doing those kinds of things and make friends there, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, so are you saying get a job here as a janitor, and then you and I can be best friends?</p>
<p>That is absolutely not what I was saying.</p>
<p>I'm going to talk to the principal, see if I can get that job, and then we'll work on the friendship thing.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>No, don't do that.</p>
<p>Charlie, don't do that.</p>
<p>Oh, Goddamn it, don't do that.</p>
<p>That... this is my thing.</p>
<p>What, what, what, what, what?</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Hey, all right!</p>
<p>There's the man.</p>
<p>What's up, buddy?</p>
<p>This place is pretty nice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's going on? You guys are gonna try and bang me afterwards or something?</p>
<p>Very nice turn you made.</p>
<p>Um, we only come here for special occasions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good, good, what's the occasion?</p>
<p>Well we brought you to this luncheon, Schmidty, because we want to make this official.</p>
<p>Mac, do you have the ring?</p>
<p>Ok, great, um...</p>
<p>Schmidty, we, uh...</p>
<p>We missed a lot of good, good years.</p>
<p>A lot of special time...</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>...with you. And...</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>You know what, I don't think I can do this.</p>
<p>It's alright, I'll take this.</p>
<p>Why is he being a big damn puss?</p>
<p>Um, Schmidty...</p>
<p>He's emotional.</p>
<p>We want you back... if you'll have this.</p>
<p>What the hell is this shit?</p>
<p>It's a sterling silver clover ring.</p>
<p>When we put all four of them together, makes a four-leaf clover, solidifying our bond for all time.</p>
<p>You're kidding, though, right?</p>
<p>No, we've never been more serious in our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever, I don't care.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>He said yes!</p>
<p>That's a yes!</p>
<p>We bagged him.</p>
<p>We certainly did.</p>
<p>Oh, food's here!</p>
<p>Food is here.</p>
<p>Oh, no, wait, though.</p>
<p>I didn't order yet.</p>
<p>Oh, that's okay.</p>
<p>I took care of the food already.</p>
<p>Yes, Dennis orders for us.</p>
<p>That is a humongous shrimp.</p>
<p>Well, it's 'cause it's not a shrimp, Frank; it's a prawn.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don't like prawns, so I eat around them.</p>
<p>Well, I'll take your prawns if you want to take my salad.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, that's what I'll do.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can do that.</p>
<p>Just put your prawns on the salad.</p>
<p>Why don't you just order what you want?</p>
<p>Uh, well, Dennis kind of has the best palate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have the most refined palate, Schmidty.</p>
<p>That's just how we do things now.</p>
<p>You've been away for a while.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>No, no, that's not what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Hey, come here really quick.</p>
<p>Um, can I get, uh... you have linguine?</p>
<p>Yeah, can I get linguine instead?</p>
<p>And, uh, what do you guys want?</p>
<p>Order whatever you want.</p>
<p>Linguine's too heavy for lunch.</p>
<p>No, no, what do you want?</p>
<p>I want fries.</p>
<p>Fries for this guy.</p>
<p>I can have fries?</p>
<p>Oh, you don't like your salad all of a sudden, Mac?</p>
<p>I... Dennis, I hate salad.</p>
<p>You hate salad?</p>
<p>Where is this coming from?</p>
<p>I hate this restaurant.</p>
<p>Yeah, this restaurant blows.</p>
<p>I'll have a ginger ale.</p>
<p>All right, there you go.</p>
<p>Come on, man, get into it.</p>
<p>I'm saying that now.</p>
<p>Can I say that now?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Hyah!</p>
<p>Absolutely, take it.</p>
<p>It's yours.</p>
<p>By all means.</p>
<p>What'd you get, a ginger ale?</p>
<p>I'm a little confused.</p>
<p>Are you telling me that this photo of Bruce Jenner is your résumé?</p>
<p>Well, when I showed up this morning, I didn't have a formal résumé on me, so I was sort of hoping the photograph of Mr. Jenner could... could represent the standard of excellence I'm hoping to bring to this position.</p>
<p>I see, and you're looking for a job as a substitute teacher?</p>
<p>Substitute janitor, all right?</p>
<p>Look, I'll clean this building so good, you're not going to know what to do with yourself.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I'm not a proud man.</p>
<p>You know, I'll do the jobs that the other guys don't want to do.</p>
<p>I'll degrade myself.</p>
<p>I'll make a genuine ass out of myself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, look, I'll swallow that eraser whole just to prove it to you.</p>
<p>Uh, no, no.</p>
<p>Please, please, no.</p>
<p>I'll swallow it whole.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You don't have to do that, but I-I have to say, I don't think I've ever encountered someone who's so passionate about joining our custodial staff.</p>
<p>The passion I have for the work that I do is extraordinary.</p>
<p>It probably goes beyond janitor.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>And I'm serious. I'm gonna eat that eraser whole.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, it's not... it's not necessary.</p>
<p>You don't need to t the eraser to prove your point.</p>
<p>Uh, you have the job.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>I love your attitude.</p>
<p>It's fantastic.</p>
<p>Sir, I am not going to let you down.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm going to start cleaning immediately.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Uh, but first, can I eat the eraser?</p>
<p>You're saying you want to eat the eraser?</p>
<p>Well, I'm asking you if it's edible because it certainly smells of grapes.</p>
<p>I don't think it's edible.</p>
<p>Can I just test it?</p>
<p>I'd rather you didn't.</p>
<p>I kinda want... I might need it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You win this one.</p>
<p>I'll pick up one of my own.</p>
<p>I'll eat that one.</p>
<p>That way everybody wins.</p>
<p>All right, well, welcome aboard.</p>
<p>All right, all right, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Ridiculous. It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, where the hell is he?</p>
<p>What did we say?</p>
<p>We said 3:00.</p>
<p>So we said 3:00, and it's, like...</p>
<p>(makes whipping sound)</p>
<p>Hyah!</p>
<p>What's crappenin', fellas?</p>
<p>Hey, Schmidty, running kinda late there, huh?</p>
<p>Am I?</p>
<p>I didn't think it mattered.</p>
<p>How could it not matter?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the final phase of your initiation back into the gang, so it kinda matters a matters a lot.</p>
<p>It actually does.</p>
<p>Whoa. Um, where's your ring?</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You didn't want me to really wear that thing, did ya?</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We're sort of sticklers for that kind of thing, too.</p>
<p>So pop that on.</p>
<p>I will. Okay.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Time and ring. Good. Got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh! Hey, look at this!</p>
<p>Nice setup fellas.</p>
<p>Candles? Where did you steal these from, huh?</p>
<p>(chuckles) Uh-oh!</p>
<p>When the hell'd you take that?</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, Schmidty.</p>
<p>We got to ya.</p>
<p>This is weird as hell.</p>
<p>You guys see that, right?</p>
<p>What's weird about this?</p>
<p>This is a men's ceremony, okay?</p>
<p>They have ceremonies for all sorts of men's clubs.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Mafia, the Freemasons, the White House.</p>
<p>The White House, they do it.</p>
<p>This is cool, okay?</p>
<p>Trust me, what we're doing is very cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Mack, why don't we get started?</p>
<p>You'll get it.</p>
<p>He'll understand as the ceremony progresses.</p>
<p>All right, Schmidty, please have a seat in the ceremonial seat.</p>
<p>I'll do the candles.</p>
<p>Uh, Frank, please do the candles.</p>
<p>Dennis, the song.</p>
<p>All right, the song.</p>
<p>(monks chanting to disco beat)</p>
<p>Uh, (laughs) look at that!</p>
<p>All right, take it, take it take it seriously.</p>
<p>I am. I'm locked in.</p>
<p>Okay, I will now begin the ceremony by administering a sweet roundhouse kick to the bell.</p>
<p>To the bell?</p>
<p>(inhales deeply)</p>
<p>(exhales sharply)</p>
<p>Uh-oh, whiff!</p>
<p>I just missed that.</p>
<p>I just missed that.</p>
<p>(exhales breath)</p>
<p>Dude, you're not even close.</p>
<p>No, Schmidty, this is all part of the ceremony.</p>
<p>You gotta stretch before this thing, huh?</p>
<p>Enjoy it.</p>
<p>One last crack, come on.</p>
<p>(Dennis groans)</p>
<p>Oh, man, this is pathetic.</p>
<p>Here, dude, look, it goes something like this.</p>
<p>Hyah! (bell rings)</p>
<p>I'm excited. I am.</p>
<p>I mean, the first part of the ceremony was a little lame, but ending it with a hot air balloon ride, that kicks ass.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, all those things.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Frank, now!</p>
<p>Push, Frank, push!</p>
<p>Go, go, go!</p>
<p>I got him. I got him.</p>
<p>Come on. Stop.</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>Come on, Frank, Frank, push him out!</p>
<p>What are you doing, trying to push me out of a moving car again?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, pull over.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this?</p>
<p>I'll just pull over.</p>
<p>Good job, Frank.</p>
<p>Tub of lard over here.</p>
<p>Give me back the ring, all right?</p>
<p>'Cause you don't deserve it!</p>
<p>Take the ring.</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>You're out of the gang, Schmidty!</p>
<p>You're out of the gang, Schmidty!</p>
<p>Get out! You're out! You're out!</p>
<p>Okay, got it. I heard ya.</p>
<p>Nice seeing you guys again.</p>
<p>Very nice meeting you.</p>
<p>Get out of the car!</p>
<p>I heard you.</p>
<p>I'm getting out, okay?</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, peel out.</p>
<p>I was gonna peel out and...</p>
<p>Don't take the steam out.</p>
<p>Tell people we pushed you!</p>
<p>All right, class, feel free to text or watch movies, whatever it is you do.</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Not today, Doc.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Dee?</p>
<p>I am inspiring you.</p>
<p>Rise and shine, dickwad.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a great teacher, but he is wasted on you.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>We're gonna be rehearsing a little musical today called Frankenstein.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>You're stupid, What?</p>
<p>You heard me.</p>
<p>You get out of here, you stupid idiot.</p>
<p>It's fine with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>And anybody else who doesn't want to be here today, you can get out now, too.</p>
<p>Hey, you want to go to the mall?</p>
<p>No, no, wait. No, no, stop.</p>
<p>Now come on, you guys!</p>
<p>That's... Not everybody.</p>
<p>Sit back down.</p>
<p>That's just something people say.</p>
<p>You guys are gonna love this.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get started.</p>
<p>Have you seen Dr. Frankenstein's creation that they all speak of?</p>
<p>Nay, I've heard tales told of his hideousness.</p>
<p>A monster most foul.</p>
<p>(plays glissando on piano)</p>
<p>(jaunty melody playing)</p>
<p>♪ My face composed of rotten flesh, roar, roar!</p>
<p>♪ A hideous beast with deadly clutch, roar, roar!</p>
<p>♪ Another's heart beats in my chest I'll never know a woman's touch... Roar! ♪</p>
<p>And then I retreat into the mist and Dr. Myers, you are Dr. Frankenstein so get up here and get acting!</p>
<p>With pleasure, Dee!</p>
<p>Just let me set the loop, and here I come!</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>Oh, whoops. That's not...</p>
<p>I am shattered to pieces!</p>
<p>Are you acting right now?</p>
<p>No, I'm not acting, you bitch!</p>
<p>I think I've broke my hip.</p>
<p>Why is this damn stage so slippery?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Charlie boy!</p>
<p>This floor is slippery, man.</p>
<p>Old school slippery 'cause I waxed it real good with this awesome power waxer that the school provided me.</p>
<p>I did this whole place in, like, two hours.</p>
<p>Oh, nice. Whoa, that's impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dee inspired me.</p>
<p>She said, "You're an awesome janitor, Charlie.</p>
<p>"You can make this whole school slippery."</p>
<p>I said, "Sure, I'll give it my best shot."</p>
<p>Then she's, like, "Let's be best friends."</p>
<p>And I was, like, "Sure, I'll give that my best shot, too."</p>
<p>So we're best friends now.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that's quite a conversation you had with her, isn't it?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What do you guys want?</p>
<p>Oh, well, we, uh, we came to ya because we wanted to tell you that we're sorry for picking Schmidty over you, and we feel like we made a big mistake, and we want you back, buddy.</p>
<p>(voice breaking): And, uh, we pushed him out of a moving car for you.</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>All right, I'll handle it.</p>
<p>Charlie, we have an announcement to make: it's your lucky day.</p>
<p>We want you back.</p>
<p><strong>Mac/Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Gotta say this is pretty classy, guys, but I wish you gave me one of these a long time time ago 'cause I'm a janitor now.</p>
<p>(power waxer whirring)</p>
