<p>No, we're not helping you.</p>

<p>Get into the spirit.</p>
<p>Let's put some decorations up.</p>
<p>Whoa. What in the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah. You like that?</p>
<p>That's an industrial-sized snow blower... we got from some dude on the Internet from the Poconos.</p>
<p>You know how it never snows on Christmas.</p>
<p>We got a backup plan this year.</p>
<p>We're gonna have a white Christmas out in front of the bar.</p>
<p>We're gonna make the snow ourselves.</p>
<p>If you guys love Christmas so much, why do you always wait... until the last possible minute to put up the Christmas decorations?</p>
<p>It is the day before Christmas.</p>
<p>That's our tradition.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what we do.</p>
<p>We drink a lot of eggnog, we pass out.</p>
<p>And then we don't put anything up, so we do it all last minute.</p>
<p>Yeah. Then we wake up Christmas morning and throw rocks at trains.</p>
<p>Why would grown men throw rocks at trains?</p>
<p>Why wouldn't we throw rocks at trains?</p>
<p>It's awesome.</p>

<p>They hate Christmas because I always got the best gifts...</p>
<p>And Frank always gave them shitty presents.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You think we don't like Christmas 'cause Frank got us shitty presents?</p>
<p>Is that really what you think?</p>
<p>No, Frank didn't buy shitty presents.</p>
<p>Frank bought the most awesome presents in the entire world.</p>
<p>He would find out whatever Christmas presents we wanted that year... and he would buy 'em for himself instead of buying 'em for us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That must have been why he wanted me to walkie you guys when you got to the bar.</p>
<p>'Cause he was trying to do something about making your Christmas better.</p>

<p>What is your problem, Frank?</p>
<p>Why do you do this to us every year?</p>
<p>I do it to you every year, Deandra... because you and your brother... never learn the lesson that I try to impart at Christmastime.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>And that is... you have to earn what you get.</p>
<p>This principle made me a multimillionaire.</p>
<p>No. No, stealing millions of dollars from your ex-business partner... is what made you a millionaire, Frank.</p>

<p>Oh, Dennis, he's gonna ruin the lining.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not even gonna begin to compare a $250,000 Italian sports car... to a handbag, but I get your point.</p>
<p>This has got to stop. However, the good news is I think there's a big opportunity in this.</p>
<p>What kind of opportunity?</p>
<p>Frank seems to think his old business partner's dead.</p>
<p>He's not dead?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>And that gives me a very interesting idea.</p>
<p>So, you wanna talk to me about Frank Reynolds.</p>
<p>Yes, we do. See, Mr. Hamilton, we heard about how Frank dicked you all up and down... and we thought we'd give you a chance to get some payback.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We thought you might wanna help us because, you see, Frank thinks you're dead.</p>
<p>Well, I have forgiven Frank.</p>
<p>Uh, what?</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>You see, some years ago I had a near-death experience... and I- I saw the light... and I saw the truth... of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>[ Teeth Click]</p>
<p>Oh. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>So, I have forgiven everyone who ever did me any harm.</p>
<p>Okay, well, uh, that's cool, because you could probably still help us.</p>
<p>Frank has not found the Lord yet.</p>
<p>No. Frank's gotten nowhere near the Lord.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so, in the spirit of the Lord and Christmas-</p>
<p>And God.</p>
<p>And, uh, all that, we wanna do a Christmas Carol type thing... where we show him the error of his ways... through his past, his present and his future.</p>
<p>See, Mr. Hamilton, we feel like if Frank can just understand... what a dick he's been to people in his past... and how he's just gonna probably end up old and alone like yourself... then maybe he'll be able to make up for some of his past mistakes.</p>
<p>When can I talk to Frank about his salvation?</p>
<p>At the end. You can do it at the very, very end.</p>
<p>The very end.</p>
<p>The very, very end. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>In fact, I think that you were just stealing from that home.</p>
