<p>(snoring)</p>
<p>(snoring continues)</p>
<p>(jingling)</p>
<p><strong>Maureen</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>Come back to bed and snuggle with me.</p>
<p>Oh... I wish I could, but I got to go to work.</p>
<p>But there's cab fare on the nightstand.</p>
<p>That's the third morning in a row you've done that.</p>
<p>We're married.</p>
<p>I'm already home, silly.</p>
<p>Right. You're here.</p>
<p>We're married, and that's cool.</p>
<p>I'm psyched, dude.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>So you're... Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you could use the cab fare though to get to work.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't work.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, okay.</p>
<p>I just thought maybe you weren't going to work recently because we were going through a little bit of a honeymoon phase.</p>
<p>But you're saying that you don't have a job.</p>
<p>No job.</p>
<p>No job at all? Wow.</p>
<p>All yours.</p>
<p>All mine.</p>
<p>All mine all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Okay. Except on my work days.</p>
<p>I do have to go to work, you know, so...</p>
<p>That's cool, though.</p>
<p>You can just hang out here, I guess, and sort of get used to the lay of the land or whatever...</p>
<p>Although, don't-don't go snooping around too much.</p>
<p>'Cause this has all happened really fast and I really haven't had time to do a pass yet.</p>
<p>Don't-don't look in those drawers.</p>
<p>What's in those drawers?</p>
<p>My sex tapes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, I got to go to work.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>(chuckles) I love you, too, Maureen.</p>
<p>(Dennis growling)</p>
<p>(Maureen growling)</p>
<p>(loud growling)</p>
<p>(both chuckle)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Okay, look, dude, all I'm saying is that you started off our domestic partnership on some very shaky, very bullshitty ground, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: And I'm saying, Charlie, you should get over it, move on.</p>
<p>You signed the prenup, case closed.</p>
<p>You told me it was the phone bill, man.</p>
<p>Of course I signed it.</p>
<p>Why would you think that you needed to sign a phone bill.</p>
<p>I can't keep track of our financial comings and goings.</p>
<p>When he hands me something to sign and it's about money and papers, I sign it.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Hey-oh.</p>
<p>Look who got a brand-new car.</p>
<p>I'm still a little bit confused as to why in the hell you two got married in the first place.</p>
<p>Charlie, gets health insurance and I get diddly-squat.</p>
<p>He's gonna get some perks.</p>
<p>He doesn't trust me.</p>
<p>Hey, why in the hell are you bathing yourself in the sink?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Because I don't have a home anymore.</p>
<p>So this is where I take a shower.</p>
<p>This is where I live, Dennis.</p>
<p>(text message alert)</p>
<p>Texting me again.</p>
<p>This is pathetic.</p>
<p>Back me up on this, Dennis.</p>
<p>You got a prenup with Maureen, right?</p>
<p>Uh, no, I did not.</p>
<p>Should I have?</p>
<p>(test alert buzzing)</p>
<p>Should you have?</p>
<p>You are screwed.</p>
<p>Typical.</p>
<p>This is so typical.</p>
<p>My God, Dee, you clearly have something you want to say.</p>
<p>So let's just get it over with.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, it's no big deal.</p>
<p>It's just Bill Ponderosa is like obsessed with me now or something.</p>
<p>I don't know, he's texting me all the time.</p>
<p>He calls me, like, nonstop.</p>
<p>He bought me a new car.</p>
<p>Dee, are you seriously bragging about sleeping with a married man?</p>
<p>Yeah, one second you're on your high horse about how great marriage is, and now you're destroying one?</p>
<p>Well, I'm not the one who's married.</p>
<p>I didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>You let him buy you a car.</p>
<p>Well, Frank, I'm not going to go passing on free cars.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, all this talk about marriage and Dee being such a whore has got me thinking... I never got a bachelor party.</p>
<p>We should go to the strip club.</p>
<p>Right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, immediately.</p>
<p>And since you would have been my best man, you should probably throw it for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm still pretty pissed about you not throwing me a bachelor party.</p>
<p>So this way I figure we'll be even.</p>
<p>I'm ready for this.</p>
<p>Being married to Charlie's got me all confused.</p>
<p>I got to get my hetero on.</p>
<p>♪ Want to get dirty, dirty ♪<br />

<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Motorcycle?</p>
<p>That's pretty...</p>
<p>Yeah, not like that, though.</p>
<p>It's pretty good, but you got to use...</p>
<p>(imitates engine revving)</p>
<p>...a little bit more shoulder.</p>
<p>I like the way he's doing it, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause I'm like, I'm bending the bike.</p>
<p>But that's not really how you drive a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you're not really driving a motorcycle.</p>
<p>It's my thing, okay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, if you're not going to take it seriously, then don't... Then don't do it.</p>
<p>I feel like I was doing it pretty good.</p>
<p>I feel like you're taking it too seriously.</p>
<p>Let's not fight.</p>
<p>It's a bachelor party.</p>
<p>Oh, I got a text.</p>
<p>I got a text from the woman.</p>
<p>"Miss you."</p>
<p>I'll just write, "Miss you, too.</p>
<p>Miss you, too."</p>
<p>Now do I write the word "too" or should I write the number two?</p>
<p>What's the best way to do that when we're texting back and forth?</p>
<p>Who cares, dude?</p>
<p>I'll do the word, I'll do the word.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Frank, what's with the purse?</p>
<p>It's my money bag.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make it rain, baby.</p>
<p>Whoa, hold on.</p>
<p>Make it rain?</p>
<p>What is that... You gonna chuck money everywhere?</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>Will you lighten up?</p>
<p>I'd like to make it rain.</p>
<p>Can I make it rain, Mac?</p>
<p>Why are you asking me?</p>
<p>Well, dude, 'cause I can't fund my own bachelor party.</p>
<p>That's just tacky.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What is the recommended amount of money for one to make it rain?</p>
<p>I'd say at least a thousand.</p>
<p>How much would it cost for this gentleman and I to get a nice couple's dance?</p>
<p>Sorry. You have to be a couple for that.</p>
<p>We are a couple.</p>
<p>Charlie, documents.</p>
<p>All right, this is what it was all for.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Look at this... We're married.</p>
<p>Oh, you guys are cute.</p>
<p>You're still going to have to pay full price.</p>
<p>Screw this.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go make it rain.</p>

<p>I don't need your little allowance.</p>
<p>Hey, we'll see.</p>
<p>(text message alert)</p>
<p>"Miss you more."</p>
<p>That's classic Maureen right there.</p>
<p>She's always got to one-up me "Miss you most."</p>
<p>Most... Can't get more than most, right?</p>
<p>So that should... that should be the end of it, right?</p>
<p>So, I hope so.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>You just cannot get enough, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Sorry for just showing up, you know, but you weren't responding to my texts.</p>
<p>Oh, I totally get it.</p>
<p>Once you pop, you can't stop, am I right?</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>Actually, I came clean to my wife.</p>
<p>And she kicked me out of the house.</p>
<p>Ew. Ouch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bet you wish you could take that one back.</p>
<p>So I was thinking, maybe I could stay here tonight.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You are somewhat responsible for this.</p>
<p>No. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Can't you stay in a hotel or something.</p>
<p>Isn't that...?</p>
<p>I would, but she froze my assets.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>shit's getting pretty real for you, huh?</p>
<p>But nonetheless, uh, I really, like I said, I don't want you in my space.</p>
<p>So there's got to be a lot of other places that you could stay that aren't, you know, here.</p>
<p>Dee, I gave you a car.</p>
<p>You're gonna jam the car in my face, huh?</p>

<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Hey... Hey...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>It is 2:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>I was sleeping, Dennis.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Well, you're up now, baby girl, so let's do some shots.</p>
<p>No, I don't drink.</p>
<p>You know that.</p>
<p>I think it makes people look ugly.</p>
<p>I...</p>
<p>Maybe I should go to my room.</p>
<p>That is not your room anymore.</p>
<p>It is my craft studio, so kindly stay out of there.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Don't freak out, dude.</p>
<p>It's all good, dude.</p>
<p>She turned it into her craft studio where she makes terrible sweatshirts out of cats or... puts cats in sweatshirts, and then...</p>
<p>I'm, like, "Dude, what the hell did you do?"</p>
<p>Dennis, do not talk to me that way.</p>
<p>I am your wife.</p>
<p>Please show me some respect in front of your friends.</p>
<p>Uh, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm not entirely certain that Maureen Ponderosa.</p>
<p>That doesn't even...</p>
<p>I don't know what that... What?</p>
<p>Divorce!</p>
<p>What? What did you just say?</p>
<p>I will divorce you, Maureen.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>Okay, you're drunk.</p>
<p>Why don't we just go to bed...?</p>
<p>I'm not drunk.</p>
<p>I'm more sober than I've ever been in my entire life.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm a little bit drink.</p>
<p>I'm totally drunk, but my mind is sober.</p>
<p>And my mind's telling me the following: I don't love you, Maureen.</p>
<p>I don't love you.</p>
<p>I never loved you.</p>
<p>You're annoying and you're strange.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>Don't say anything 'cause every time you open your mouth, I'm, like, "Ugh!"</p>
<p>It's like her breath...</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>It's like always so bad.</p>
<p>It's like a dead tooth.</p>
<p>It's the dead tooth.</p>
<p>I'm saying it now. I'll say it.</p>
<p>You have a dead tooth.</p>
<p>You realize that, right?</p>
<p>And I hate it, and it's annoying!</p>
<p>I want you and your boy toy out of my apartment now!</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>I'm the boy toy!</p>
<p>You're my boy toy.</p>
<p>You know, I'm not gonna leave our apartment.</p>
<p>Or should I say "my apartment,"</p>
<p>'cause it's my apartment.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>How about if you guys don't leave, I call the cops and I tell 'em you beat me?</p>
<p>What in the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I didn't touch you.</p>
<p>What...? What are you doing?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I recognize that. What is that?</p>
<p><em>Oh, shit, that's from... that's from Fear, dude.</em></p>
<p>Oh, that's Marky Mark.</p>
<p>That's Marky Mark.</p>
<p>That's what Marky Mark does.</p>
<p>He does that, and then, um...</p>
<p>Oh, shit, and then the cops come, and then he...</p>
<p>Oh, and the police think that <em>William Petersen, the guy from CSI...</p>
<p> Go. She means business.</p>
<p>She means business.</p>
<p>shit! Oh, shit! Ah!</em></p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You are really making yourself at home here, huh?</p>
<p>Sorry. Want to have sex?</p>
<p>What? No, no!</p>
<p>God, no!</p>
<p>Please close your legs up.</p>
<p>That's... Listen, I don't want to get into your personal life, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It's not really any of my business, but this is really bumming me out, okay?</p>
<p>So here's what I'd like to do.</p>
<p>I'd like to talk game plan with you, okay?</p>
<p>And, um, number one, and most importantly, uh, the car.</p>
<p>Now hear me out.</p>
<p>It was kinda a gift, so it'd be pretty rude of you to try and...</p>
<p>I don't give a shit about the car, okay?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>My life is in ruins.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I'm gonna lose my kids.</p>
<p>Okay, great, so we're in agreement.</p>
<p>I keep the car.</p>
<p>That's wonderful.</p>
<p>Now secondly, this is gonna be kind of hard to hear, but, um... Get out!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>You gotta go back to your wife, okay?</p>
<p>And get out of my place.</p>
<p>Okay, well, then I'm gonna need the car to get over there.</p>
<p>Okay, well, the car's off the table, okay?</p>
<p>We just discussed the car, and we came to an agreement that...</p>
<p>Stop bringing up the car, okay?</p>
<p>So I'll get dressed and I'll drive you over there, and I'll drop you off.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, get up.</p>
<p>No, oh, God, I don't, I don't...</p>
<p>Okay, I'm gonna go in here.</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Yeah, you now, I mean, I wouldn't have imagined the whole thing going down quite the way it did.</p>
<p>It was a little uncomfortable, but I'm glad, you know, we got our little heart-to-heart, or whatever you want to call it, out of the way.</p>
<p>I feel like now we can set aside our differences and settle this whole divorce pretty amicably, you know?</p>
<p>You think it's gonna be that easy, dude?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, marriage and divorce these days, it's like a, it's more of a formality than anything else, you know?</p>
<p>It's just sort of something that you do, right?</p>
<p>Don't start with me, Charlie!</p>
<p>You bring nothing to the table!</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I bring nothing to the table!</p>
<p>This is my money!</p>
<p>You bring nothing!</p>
<p>Frank, okay?</p>
<p>"How did my laundry get so clean?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, who washed all the dishes today?"</p>
<p>Nobody washes the dishes!</p>
<p>We eat the food directly off the coffee table, and you know it!</p>
<p>I cannot stand being married to you!</p>
<p>Oh, you can't stand it?</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull the plug.</p>
<p>You gonna flush our marriage down the toilet?</p>
<p>Right down the toilet!</p>
<p>Flush it, big boy!</p>
<p>Yes, there he goes!</p>
<p>Flush it down the toilet 'cause I don't care!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull the plug, but first I'm gonna draw up some documents.</p>
<p>All right, this is gonna be an ugly-ass divorce, and we're gonna get a mediator.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it.</p>
<p>We'll get that idiot lawyer that always helps us out.</p>
<p>He does good by us.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's excellent.</p>
<p>But he slapped a restraining order on us, so we can't use him.</p>
<p>Also you need a lawyer, too, so we should talk about it.</p>
<p>I need a lawyer?</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>How are you not grasping this situation?</p>
<p>Oh, for the divorce.</p>
<p>The divorce, yeah.</p>
<p>You're getting a divorce?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, sot's going around.</p>
<p>Okay, I think I know someone who'll take both our cases.</p>
<p>Is it you?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>'Cause if it's you, I'm not interested.</p>
<p>All right, well, I have a family member who's a lawyer.</p>
<p>I bet he'd do it.</p>
<p>It's coming up here.</p>
<p>This... yeah, this is it right here.</p>
<p>The Ponderosas' ponderosa.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Could you wait a minute?</p>
<p>I just want to make sure it's okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, whatever it's gonna take to wrap this up, really.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>(breathes heavily)</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>(dial tone, touch tones beeping)</p>
<p>(ringtone plays)</p>
<p>Maureen?</p>
<p>No, it's Dee.</p>
<p>How are things going on your end?</p>
<p>Oh, not bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, not bad.</p>
<p>I'm getting a divorce.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Yeah, I know how that goes.</p>
<p>I got a messy situation going on on my end, too.</p>
<p>Had to let my guy go.</p>
<p>Had to cut him loose.</p>
<p>I tell you what, though, I do love the car.</p>
<p>Hands-free Blue...</p>
<p>I can do all kinds of stuff with both hands.</p>
<p>(Bill, kids laughing)</p>
<p>Dennis? Did we get cut off?</p>
<p>Okay, hop in there.</p>
<p>No! Wha-wha-wha-wha-what is this?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Here he comes!</p>
<p>Okay, go, go! Go, go!</p>
<p>What? Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(tires squeal)</p>
<p>I'm so glad you called, Charlie.</p>
<p>Your uncle never hears from you anymore.</p>
<p>Well, you're kind of the only actual lawyer I know, you know, that doesn't have a restraining order against me.</p>
<p>So I sort of had to call you, so...</p>
<p>I miss you too, bud.</p>
<p>Uh... With the touching, with the touching... None of that.</p>
<p>You're put off by my hands.</p>
<p>I know they're very small.</p>
<p>It's been very hard on me.</p>
<p>It is not... There's nothing wrong with your hands, okay?</p>
<p>Can we just focus on the law?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>All right, as far as shared assets, I'm not seeing much.</p>
<p>I'm keeping the hot plate.</p>
<p>Over my dead body.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, easy, boys.</p>
<p>Don't let the dog off the leash, okay?</p>
<p>Remember, the bigger man walks away first.</p>
<p>You can have the hot plate.</p>
<p>Hot dog!</p>
<p>Now we're cooking with gas.</p>
<p>Moving along to art holdings.</p>
<p>All I'm seeing is a series of drawings of elephants.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Charlie did the elephant drawings.</p>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
<p>You should keep 'em.</p>
<p>I did those for you, man.</p>
<p>I like 'em.</p>
<p>Well, you should like 'em.</p>
<p>I put a lot of work into 'em.</p>
<p>And thank you for saying you like 'em.</p>
<p>I've seen 'em and I like 'em, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're good.</p>
<p>I'll keep the drawings, okay?</p>
<p>If I didn't know any better, I'd say there's a lot of love in this room here.</p>
<p>Look, Jack, we just want to get back to where we were.</p>
<p>That's... Sounds like what you guys want is an annulment.</p>
<p>It would essentially void your partnership.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, that sounds perfect.</p>
<p>Marriage blows.</p>
<p>Preaching to the choir, fellas.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>All right, I just need both your signatures on here.</p>
<p>All right, that's easy enough.</p>
<p>Easy-peasy.</p>
<p>One... Two.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Your union has hereby been dissolved.</p>
<p>Why did we have to do all the touching and the hand-holding if it was just...?</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>Hey, Mac.</p>
<p>Do you mind snapping a photo for the Web site?</p>
<p>But keep my hands out of the shot.</p>
<p>I just kidnapped Bill Ponderosa's kids.</p>
<p>All right, are the kids confined in any way, maybe in a crawl space or a backyard bunker?</p>
<p>No, they're out in the car.</p>
<p>Have you touched them yet?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>What...? Who is this man?</p>
<p>(vehicle approaching, tires squealing)</p>
<p>No, you don't need to...</p>
<p>What is she, some cheap tramp... huh?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Bill, oh, my God, you are such an asshole.</p>
<p>I followed you, okay?</p>
<p>Angel, I...</p>
<p>I knew you were seeing someone else.</p>
<p>Honey, that... Hi.</p>
<p>Hi, there, I'm Dee.</p>
<p>Uh, I understand that.</p>
<p>Listen, I wanted to say I'm really sorry about the kids.</p>
<p>I tell you what, I did not mean to kidnap them.</p>
<p>That was all... that was all this guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're not my kids.</p>
<p>Aren't you his wife?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm his mistress.</p>
<p>Well, what the hell, man?</p>
<p>I'm taking my car back.</p>
<p>Nuh-uh. That's my car.</p>
<p>Actually, I loaned it to both of you ladies...</p>
<p>(vehicle approaching, tires squealing)</p>
<p><strong>Jane</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>I gonna kill you!</p>
<p>What? How many mistresses do you have?</p>
<p>Mistress? I'm his wife.</p>
<p>Kids, let's go.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on, kids, let's go home.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Not you, Bill.</p>
<p>Now I want this to be over with right now.</p>
<p>So how much does he owe you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>How much does he owe you, whore?</p>
<p>How much does he owe you for the sex?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I'm not a prostitute.</p>
<p>I think that's... That's clear.</p>
<p>Oh, well, congratulations.</p>
<p>You're the only woman he didn't have to pay to sleep with.</p>
<p>You must be very proud of yourself.</p>
<p>(tires squealing)</p>
<p>Wait, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>(tires squealing)</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>The, uh, the gravity of my situation just set in, so... Let's go get you a divorce, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys have any questions?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a question.</p>
<p>What's in the fanny pack?</p>
<p>Oh, check this out, Mac and Dennis.</p>
<p>Just a little victory dance.</p>
<p>Thought maybe we could hang out later.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, I'm sorry, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Well, when I heard you were getting divorced, I-I felt compelled to involve myself.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, how would you have heard that I was getting a listening to you drunkenly explain all that at 3:00 a.m.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it so much, that I tracked down Maureen here and I offered her my services... pro bono, of course.</p>
<p>Hold on, fellas.</p>
<p>I'm Jack Kelly.</p>
<p>I'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>Hello, Jack Kelly.</p>
<p>The pleasure is all mine.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p>The pleasure's... Still...</p>
<p>Why don't we just get started.</p>
<p>Why don't we just get started.</p>
<p>Aw...</p>
<p>Boy, the old place, huh?</p>
<p>Some good memories here.</p>
<p>All of us.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, um... So I was like...</p>
<p>I'm gonna go, I think...</p>
<p>No, no, no, stick around, dude.</p>
<p>Stick around.</p>
<p>Please don't go.</p>
<p>I don't...</p>
<p>I don't want to, though.</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>No, you should stay...</p>
<p>I use shea butter.</p>
<p>Assorted lanolin products.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm serious, you could be a hand model.</p>
<p>You've got the goods.</p>
<p>That was quick, guys.</p>
<p>Open and shut case, Dennis.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did you get the apartment back?</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>And you also acquired Ms.</p>
<p>Ponderosa's debt.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>What? You're in debt?</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>But you are... About 90K.</p>
<p>This guy seems to think you don't have a case and I'm inclined to agree with him.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, when I found out that Ms.</p>
<p>Ponderosa here had been cast out of her marital home, I only thought it was fair that you assumed her debt in addition to the alimony payments, of course.</p>
<p>Wait a second... So I got to pay alimony payments?</p>
<p>Uncle Jack, what the hell?</p>
<p>I froze up.</p>
<p>He's great.</p>
<p><em>Oh, congratulations, Miss Ponderosa.</p>
<p>Congratulations to you!</p>
<p>See you around, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mac.</p>
<p>Hey, Mac, would you mind taking a shot of the three of us for the Web site.</p>
<p>Come on, Dennis.</p>
<p>And would it be okay if you put your hands on top of mine?</p>
<p>Like they're my hands?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Like that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That looks like my hands.</p>
<p>For the Web site.</p>
<p>We're lawyers.</em></p>
