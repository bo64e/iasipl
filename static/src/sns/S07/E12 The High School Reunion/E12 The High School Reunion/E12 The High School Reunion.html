<p>Oh, man, this reunion is going to be awesome, dude.</p>
<p>I am going to fire into that school, and it is gonna propel me back into the mid-'90s when Dennis Reynolds was a golden god.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, I'm so excited to show these douche bags my new back.</p>
<p>No brace, fools! Baby got back!</p>
<p>♪ Oh-oh, baby got back. ♪</p>
<p>Dee, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Baby, got back.</p>
<p>You know that one.</p>

<p>♪ Baby got... ♪</p>
<p>Sir Mix-a-Lot was not talking about women whose backs have recovered from horrific spinal disorder.</p>
<p>He was talking about gorgeous black women and their big beautiful black butts.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Black butts are good.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>They're good, right?</p>
<p>Guess what. Baby got back, and I can't wait to shove it into these fools' faces, so let's get going.</p>
<p>Whatever. I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Let's just do what we always did before every school-sponsored event and let's...smash 'em up?</p>
<p>Let's smash 'em up!</p>
<p>Oh... Smash 'em up!</p>
<p>Hey, right?</p>
<p>I got these.</p>
<p>I get an atomic wedgie.</p>
<p>It's not gonna happen, dude.</p>
<p>We're adults now.</p>
<p>I'm not taking any risks here, all right?</p>
<p>And if it does happen, I'm gonna get high, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, I'm gonna huff stuff.</p>
<p>No, Charlie, you don't have to do things like that anymore.</p>
<p>You don't need to huff shit or eat weird things to get people to like you.</p>
<p>Nah, I think he does.</p>
<p>You guys were pretty much nothing in high school.</p>
<p>If he wasn't the class clown and you didn't sell drug, you'd definitely be nothing; nobodies.</p>
<p>Well, if shit happens, I'm going directly to Plan B.</p>
<p>We're not gonna have to do Plan B, okay?</p>
<p>You know, I'm gonna come right out and say that I'm not doing Plan B regardless of what happens with you guys.</p>
<p>I'm only here for Plan B.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Faculty or alumni?</p>
<p>Neither one.</p>
<p>Well, you can't go in.</p>
<p>No, but we're friends.</p>
<p>We're buddies.</p>
<p>We hang out together.</p>
<p>We do everything together.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I'm gonna go inside because, Frank, I can't have you ruining this for me.</p>
<p>But what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>I don't know!</p>
<p>Hang out in the parking lot and drink beer till we're done.</p>
<p>We smashed all the beers.</p>
<p>Oh, no, actually, I have a few more.</p>
<p>You guys want one?</p>
<p>You can't bring those inside.</p>
<p>Well, then guess what.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Smash 'em up!</p>
<p>(all laugh)</p>
<p>All right, turkey.</p>
<p>See ya, Frank.</p>
<p>See ya, jerk jerky.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, baby, this is great.</p>
<p>This brings me back.</p>
<p>I'm anxious, I'm excited, I can't wait to see the waitress.</p>
<p>Charlie, give it a rest.</p>
<p>I know, but we've been clicking lately.</p>
<p>This is gonna be a good night for us.</p>
<p>Like, remember how she was the coolest girl in school?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, she was definitely the prettiest girl in school.</p>
<p>She was not. She was not, no.</p>
<p>Maybe the most forgettable girl in school.</p>
<p>Yeah, which, by the way, is the worst thing you could be in high school.</p>
<p>Totally insignificant.</p>
<p>Either way, good feelings are gonna get sparked up.</p>
<p>I'm gonna see her, she's gonna see me.</p>
<p>You guys, you guys, you guys.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Brad Fisher. Brad Fisher.</p>
<p>He is not gonna be happy to see me after that present I gave him.</p>
<p>Uh, what present?</p>
<p>Oh, the box of hornets.</p>
<p>Ooh, that acne really came back, didn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it sure did.</p>
<p>The guy looks like shit.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right, I tell you what.</p>
<p>Why don't you guys sneak past him, and Mac and I will pick up the name tags.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We'll meet you inside.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, go, go, go.</p>
<p>All right, come on.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, it's Brad Fisher, all right!</p>
<p>How you doing, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>Brad</strong>: Not great.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, well, the acne definitely came back in full force.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's a shame, but I have products that will clear that acne up, man.</p>
<p>It's not acne, actually.</p>
<p>No, no, it's hornet scars.</p>
<p>Ooh! Ouch. Yikes.</p>
<p>I don't think I have any products that'll, that'll take care of hornet scars.</p>
<p>That's more of a...</p>
<p>Plastic surgery situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, plastic surgery would do it, though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But lasers... Lasers would do it.</p>
<p>They'd blast those monsters...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You guys seen Charlie around?</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, we don't, we don't associate with him anymore.</p>
<p>All right, I'm gonna take off.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Messy.</p>
<p>Ooh-hoo-hoo.</p>
<p>Let's stay out of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's stay out of that.</p>
<p>Let's just grab our name tags, huh?</p>
<p>I don't see 'em over here.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, we got Charlie, we got Dee, I got myself right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, uh, I'm not seeing yours.</p>
<p>Yeah, I grabbed mine already.</p>
<p>It's in my pocket.</p>
<p>Oh, did you grab it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, well, pop it on.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm probably not gonna wear mine.</p>
<p>I mean, who wears a name tag, right?</p>
<p>That's not cool.</p>
<p>I'm gonna wear mine.</p>
<p>I'm seeing everybody else wearing their name tags, so just pop that on, buddy.</p>
<p>Nobody calls me this anymore.</p>
<p>And I feel like it's gonna confuse people.</p>
<p>It's not, because everybody called you that in high school, so pop it on because it's definitely a rule and they're not gonna let you inside without it.</p>
<p>It's been so long.</p>
<p>It's probably not even my name legally anymore.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to pop it on.</p>
<p>(sighs) Okay.</p>
<p>(heart pounding)</p>
<p>Good. Well, okay, Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>Don't call me that.</p>
<p>Well, it's your name.</p>
<p>So, Ronald, I'm gonna take a little lap around, get people abuzz about my presence at the reunion.</p>
<p>And I'll meet up with you guys later, okay?</p>

<p>No one, no one calls me... ♪<br />

<p>Is he looking?</p>
<p>Who? That guy?</p>
<p>Yes, is he looking at my back rig now?</p>
<p>Do you see the waitress anywhere?</p>
<p>Come on. Shut up.</p>
<p>He's not looking at your back, Dee.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Why are you so obsessed with this guy?</p>
<p>It's Adriano Calvaniste, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's the guy who coined the name "Aluminum monster."</p>
<p>Really? That's him?!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>I want to meet him.</p>
<p>You have met him, Charlie.</p>
<p>He called you Dirtgrub and he made you eat spiders.</p>
<p>Oh, that guy!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, he was, like, so cool.</p>
<p>He was, like, way above me.</p>
<p>Yeah, him and his cronies all thought that they were way above you and everybody else, but I've got a plan to get revenge.</p>
<p>I'm gonna sew myself into their inner circle.</p>
<p>Cool. How you gonna do that?</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna lure 'em in with my good looks, and then as far as I remember, all you really got to do to get in with that crowd is be really cruel to people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna gain their trust and when the moment's right, I'm gonna strike.</p>
<p>Oh, cool, all right.</p>
<p>I'm doing it for us, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Is it, is it him?</p>
<p>He's coming over.</p>
<p>All right, do you see a spider I can eat?</p>
<p>I can eat a spider.</p>
<p>No, stop. Charlie, keep your mouth shut, keep your...</p>
<p><strong>Adriano</strong>: Hey, um, excuse me, but aren't you the aluminum monster?</p>
<p>Yes. I mean, no.</p>
<p>People don't call me that anymore, but yeah.</p>
<p>Nor should they.</p>
<p>I mean, wow, you've, uh, you've really transformed.</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Hey, Dirtgrub.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>That's so cool.</p>
<p>You're so cool, Adriano.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, um, why don't you smell this?</p>
<p>Well, it's probably poisonous, right?</p>
<p>Probably, but, you know, smell it anyway.</p>
<p>Should-should I smell it?</p>
<p>Smell it.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie!</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>Oh, he wanted me to smell a pen, and I was going to smell the pen, because it's Adriano...</p>
<p>You don't have to do that anymore.</p>
<p>Hey, Ronald McDonald, right?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>For your information, nobody calls me that.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>What did we call you?</p>
<p>Ronnie the Rat.</p>
<p>Ronnie the Rat, yeah, I remember, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Why did we call him that anyway?</p>
<p>'Cause he was a nark and a tattletale, and he became the main drug dealer when he told on the other main drug dealer.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, yeah, I remember.</p>
<p>Well, looks like the rat got a little too much cheese, huh?</p>
<p>Fat.</p>
<p>That's not funny.</p>
<p>I put on mass.</p>
<p>We eat a lot of cheese.</p>
<p>We eat a lot of cheese.</p>
<p>To put on mass.</p>
<p>Didn't you also give everybody ringworm?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That was a rumor.</p>
<p>I only gave ringworm to Charlie.</p>
<p>I got it from my dog Poppins, and then Charlie and I were wrestling every day because we were trying out for the wrestling team, and then, you know, we just sort of passed it back and forth.</p>
<p>We passed it back and forth...</p>
<p>Although then we did try out for the wrestling team, and then I do think a couple of the guys got it on the team, so yeah, you're right, you're right.</p>
<p>Wow, yeah, yeah, no, that is really gross.</p>
<p>I mean, that is...</p>
<p>Yeah, that's about as low as it gets.</p>
<p>They probably still have it, 'cause they're so gay together.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee, why don't you come back to our table-- you know, have a drink?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>That sounds cool.</p>
<p>See you later, Dirtgrub and Ronnie the Rat.</p>
<p>Hope you suck each other's rotten peckers until you get mouth cancer.</p>
<p>Mouth cancer.</p>
<p>Can I come to the table?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>For some reason, homophobia, it's just, it's awesome to these guys. I'm sewing myself in.</p>
<p>I'm doing this for us, okay?</p>
<p>What the hell is she talking about?</p>
<p>She's going to strike when the moment's right.</p>
<p>She's doing it for us, dude.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you thank her?</p>
<p>Of course I thanked her, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oh, what's up, boys?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>All right, I got your name tags.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, did you get on Mac about his?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's got... It's not that...</p>
<p>It's not funny.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>Adriano came over, blasted him about it.</p>
<p>Oh he did?</p>
<p>Oh, good, oh good.</p>
<p>So Adriano's probably going to tell everybody about it.</p>
<p>That's going to get around the whole reunion.</p>
<p>It'll get going round and round and round.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Probably getting old already.</p>
<p>So listen, guys, this is where we part ways, all right?</p>
<p>So do do not talk to me for the rest of the night, and know that I won't be talking to you, because you lower my stock.</p>
<p>You guys get it.</p>
<p>I'm going to go post up one of these tables around here, let my loyal subjects come and kiss my ring.</p>

<p>Remember the time he crashed my car into the tree?</p>
<p>He went crazy and the tire went down...</p>
<p>We had such a good time.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank, first off, Nicki Potnick is a girl, okay?</p>
<p>And secondly, she's not 65 years old.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk to you.</p>
<p>I don't want to be around you.</p>
<p>Go find Mac and Charlie.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>

<p>Can we not talk about alimony payments right now?</p>
<p>We're at our reunion.</p>
<p>Didn't think you'd run into your ex-wife, huh?</p>
<p>No, I didn't think about it, Maureen, because I don't think about you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
<p>Oh, it wafted over here.</p>
<p>The dead tooth-- it spurted in my nose, it stinks.</p>
<p>What is that supposed to be?</p>
<p>That's where your monthly payments are going.</p>
<p>That's a diamond tooth, Dennis.</p>
<p>A dead tooth, Maureen.</p>
<p>With a diamond in it.</p>
<p>Put a diamond on anything that's dead, and it's still dead, Maureen. It's rotting.</p>
<p>Get it out of your face.</p>
<p>Look, I don't want to talk about these things, all right?</p>
<p>I don't want to talk to old men who are pretending to be women, and-and ex-wives, all right?</p>

<p>But he made fake ones, and he gets to drink and we don't.</p>
<p>That's not fair!</p>
<p>Bro, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>If those are fake, you can't get any of these beers.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>(Mac laughs)</p>
<p>You got in trouble.</p>
<p>You got in trouble!</p>
<p>Wow. Ronnie the Rat strikes again, huh?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, douchebag.</p>
<p>You're the worst, Dirtgrub.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn't have anything to do...</p>
<p>Don't sell me out.</p>
<p>See what you did, man?</p>
<p>We're supposed to be on the same team, Charlie.</p>
<p>Aw... see, high school sucks!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I'm going to go to the bathroom, I'm going to find stuff to huff, I'm going to get high.</p>
<p>If I'm the Dirtgrub, I'm going to be the Dirtgrub.</p>
<p>(Mac sighs in exasperation)</p>
<p>We're going to go into Plan B.</p>
<p>Because I brought Dee's old back brace, and I got it in the car.</p>
<p>So, we can implement... Not now, Frank!</p>
<p>A little rehearsal or something.</p>
<p>No, Charlie, dude, you don't have to do this.</p>
<p>We can find another way.</p>
<p>Yes, I do!</p>
<p>I'm just the Dirtgrub, okay?</p>
<p>Everyone wants the Dirtgrub, I'll give 'em the Dirtgrub.</p>
<p>I'll get high, I'll get sad.</p>
<p>People can laugh at me.</p>
<p>I hate high school, man.</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie, don't put the bleach and the ammonia together!</p>
<p>It's going to knock the shit out of you.</p>
<p>Don't tell me how to mix my own inhalants!</p>
<p>I know how to do inhalants.</p>
<p>Charlie, it's going to knock you unconscious.</p>
<p>Okay, I know how to do my own inhalants, okay?</p>
<p>I don't need that from... God.</p>
<p>Whoops-a-daisy.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, let's just wait till he wakes up, and then we'll... Oh, wow.</p>
<p>What do we got here?</p>
<p>Ronnie the Rat and, uh...</p>
<p>Hey, look, everyone, Nicki Potnick made it to the reunion.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Looks like you had a rough couple of years, there, Nicki.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I'm a guy now.</p>
<p>Mm. Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing, perving out on Dirtgrub over there?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>That's what these gay guys do, they just... knock each other out with poppers, and then find some kinda rabies-infested rodent to tickle each other's taints with.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>No. No, that's not what we're doing, all right?</p>
<p>We are grown adults.</p>
<p>We are respected businessmen now.</p>
<p>You did kind of rat me out there, Ronnie, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I guess it's time to pay the piper, Rat.</p>
<p>And, uh... old man I don't know.</p>
<p>Whoa! No, no!</p>
<p>What the hell are...?!</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>I've been waiting a long time for this.</p>
<p>You know me!</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>I'm a grown, goddamn man!</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>You should stay away from those people.</p>
<p>I mean, they-they will ruin your life like they tried to ruin mine.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You guys just missed something so awesome that we did.</p>
<p>Heed my warning.</p>
<p>Hey, how you guys doing?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm here.</p>
<p>Can you believe I came to this thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was posted up over there, I guess you guys probably didn't see me.</p>
<p>No, we saw you.</p>
<p>Oh, did you?</p>
<p>Oh, okay, well... no reason to be intimidated.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>I'm a human being, after all.</p>
<p>You know, just a... just a man.</p>
<p>Actually, we're good.</p>
<p>Uh, no, Tim. We're not good.</p>
<p>And you're definitely not good, because you haven't had the chance to hang out with me yet.</p>
<p>Um... my wallet's missing.</p>
<p>Oh my God, my necklace is missing.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>My gold chain's gone.</p>
<p>Have you seen my necklace?</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>And with all the security.</p>
<p>The fact you even need it...</p>
<p>Wait a second, Mara.</p>
<p>What is that around your neck?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, that's, uh... probably just a ar that...</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>(people exclaiming)</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>I've sinned!</p>
<p>My God, you are covered in ringworm.</p>
<p>It's her fault.</p>
<p>She told me she loved me.</p>
<p>We were supposed to be together forever.</p>
<p>Calm down, Cricks.</p>
<p>What's he talking about?</p>
<p>Dee, were you two together?</p>
<p>No! Me, with him?</p>
<p>I... what are you, crazy? No!</p>
<p>Yeah, I told him I loved him once, but that was like four years ago.</p>
<p>You two probably have ringworm together, don't you?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, of course I don't have ringworm!</p>
<p>No no no, stay away from me!</p>
<p>To think I was going to let you jack me off...</p>
<p>Wait wait... you were?</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Get this asshole out of here.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>Come on, move, come on.</p>
<p>Hey, you know I don't have ringworm, right?</p>
<p>You guys.</p>
<p>No, we don't have ringworm.</p>
<p>I don't have ringworm.</p>
<p>No, no, we're cool!</p>
<p>Yeah, we're like the... Oh, really?</p>
<p>Oh, son of a bitch.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
