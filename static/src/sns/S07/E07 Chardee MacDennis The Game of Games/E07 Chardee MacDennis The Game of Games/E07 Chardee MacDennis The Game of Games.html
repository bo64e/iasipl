<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: So what do you guys wanna do today?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>We could sing a song.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: We just ate.</p>
<p>We're drinking.</p>
<p>Hey, you know what?</p>
<p>Mac's coming over here pretty soon...</p>
<p>Mac's always got something...</p>
<p>He'll have a plan...</p>
<p>He always has something.</p>
<p>And he'll get us into something good.</p>
<p>He comes in with something.</p>
<p>He comes in hot.</p>
<p>That'll be perfect.</p>
<p>'Cause I feel like we're having a hard time getting into something good today.</p>
<p>There he is! There he is!</p>
<p>Good timing!</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Mac in the house.</p>
<p>Mac in the house.</p>
<p>Mac in the house.</p>
<p>(all shouting happily)</p>
<p>Got some news?</p>
<p>Got some news for me?</p>
<p>Lay it on us.</p>
<p>What's the news?</p>
<p>What's your news?</p>
<p>No, what's your news?</p>
<p>Give us the news.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't have any news.</p>
<p>I thought you guys had news.</p>
<p>You always come in hot with news.</p>
<p>Yeah, what's the plan?</p>
<p>Oh. I got nothin'.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Huh? Oh.</p>
<p>That's disappointing.</p>
<p>You usually fire in here with something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I've actually been kinda bored today.</p>
<p>We're bored over here.</p>
<p>You guys bored, too?</p>
<p>We are bored out of our goddamn minds.</p>
<p>You got no plan?</p>
<p>Didn't run into a thing or...?</p>
<p>Oh... wait... guys...</p>
<p>I know what we can do.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Let's play "Chardee MacDennis."</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>No, no... No!</p>
<p>'Cause we're not playing!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: What's "Chardee MacDennis"?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>"Chardee MacDennis" is an awesome board game that we came up with, many years ago, on a day much like today.</p>
<p>That sounds like fun.</p>
<p>(chanting "Chardee! Chardee!")</p>
<p>No, we're not playing it!</p>
<p>We're not playing it!</p>
<p>Don't start chanting it, 'cause we're not playing that stupid game!</p>
<p>We are not playing that game!</p>
<p>Why? What's the big deal?</p>
<p>It's only a game.</p>
<p>It's not just a game!</p>
<p>It's a war.</p>
<p>"Chardee MacDennis: The Game of Games."</p>
<p>Now what we did is we took our favorite aspects of a bunch of different board games and we mashed 'em all together.</p>
<p>We did the same thing with the name, 'cause we couldn't agree upon one.</p>
<p>Now, the point of the game is actually quite simple: It's a race to the finish from Level One to Level Three.</p>
<p>This is the board, and we start at Level One, which is "Mind."</p>
<p>That consists of "Trivia,"</p>
<p>"Puzzles" and "Artistry."</p>
<p>It is also the level at which the alcohol being consumed is wine.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>You get to drink during the game?</p>
<p>Uh, drinking is the game, Frank.</p>
<p>It's the whole point of it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to play any game in which I'm not getting annihilated.</p>
<p>Moving on to Level Two, which is "Body": "Physical Challenge,"</p>
<p>"Pain" and "Endurance."</p>
<p>That's the beer level.</p>
<p>Yes, and Level Three is "Spirit": "Emotional Battery" and "Public Humiliation."</p>
<p>Boom-- hard alcohol level.</p>
<p>What the hell you doing, Deandra?</p>
<p>Oh, this is very important, Frank.</p>
<p>We gotta nail the board down to the bar, because, at a certain point during the game, Mac can get very pissed off, 'cause he's not doing very well.</p>
<p>He's gonna try and flip the board over.</p>
<p>He's right; it's for the best.</p>
<p>I will forget, later, that it's nailed down.</p>
<p>He will.</p>
<p>Okay, here's the big one: There's a 15-minute time limit to the game.</p>
<p>15 minutes doesn't seem like a long time for a game.</p>
<p>Well, there's a fair amount of a clock stoppages.</p>
<p>Yeah, each team gets three time-outs; there's a half-time; post-level breaks; a two-minute warning and a significant amount of injury stoppages.</p>
<p>Hence the first-aid kit.</p>
<p>Now, pay very close attention to this first part: Each team must collect a certain number of cards, at each level, in order to progress to the next level.</p>
<p>And the first team to complete all three levels wins the game.</p>
<p>And the winner-- ooh-- the winner gets a sweet prize.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>What's the prize?</p>
<p>The winner gets to smash the other team's game pieces.</p>
<p>That's the prize?</p>
<p>You get to smash the team's game pieces?</p>
<p>Oh, it's incredibly gratifying.</p>
<p>Oh, it's awesome, Frank.</p>
<p>Now these are our game pieces.</p>
<p>Nice, right?</p>
<p>And... (clears throat) these.... are Mac and Charlie's pieces.</p>
<p>Look at the condition that they're in.</p>
<p>Pretty pathetic, as you can see from the state that these pieces are in, Mac and Charlie have never, ever, in the history of Chardee MacDennis, won the game.</p>
<p>You never won?</p>
<p>Never won once?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's almost statistically impossible to play that many games and never win, but...</p>
<p>It's truly an anomaly.</p>
<p>We haven't won yet, all right?</p>
<p>But maybe this is our time, all right?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it is gonna happen.</p>
<p>Watch out! Watch out!</p>
<p>Yeah... I'm gonna slit throats.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Ack! I love this game!</p>
<p>I want in!</p>
<p>Okay, I want to be Mac and Charlie's partner.</p>
<p>That seems fair to me.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I'll say why: Because, you see, Frank's mind is still fairly strong, but his body's very, very weak, so I think it's a wash.</p>
<p>And his spirit's garbage, so I'm okay with it, too.</p>
<p>Hang on a second, dude.</p>
<p>You can't just jump on our team.</p>
<p>Let us talk about this.</p>
<p>All right, first of all, we got a team photo, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we're gonna have to decide, you know, do we get a new team photo with or without you...</p>
<p>Plus, we have a whole new strategy to come up with, you know...</p>
<p>Our strategy has never worked.</p>
<p>And I hate the team photo.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>Just join our team.</p>
<p>You're on the team.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>(all shouting)</p>
<p>Don't touch me.</p>
<p>Don't touch me.</p>
<p>Yes, and the Golden Geese are very much looking forward to another annihilation.</p>
<p>Yes, we are. Now... in the spirit of tradition, I propose that we begin the ritual of sportsmanship.</p>
<p>(faux British accent): Good luck to you, sir.</p>
<p>(British accent): And you, sir.</p>
<p>I do hope you have a good game, miss.</p>
<p>And you, sir.</p>
<p>Why the hell are youse talkin' like that?</p>
<p>Well, this is an important part of the process, Frank.</p>
<p>Gives the illusion of respect for your opponent.</p>
<p>Things are about to get real dark, real quick, Frank.</p>
<p>It's nice to start off on a positive note.</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me: Once the game begins, you are not allowed to ask any questions.</p>
<p>Yes! In fact, if you do, don't say a question, look it up in the book of rules, okay?</p>
<p>(laughing): Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Oh, I think I understand.</p>
<p>No, you haven't begun to understand, Frank, but that's okay.</p>
<p>You'll get it as we go along.</p>
<p>Like every other board game.</p>
<p>Dee, how much time?</p>
<p>Uh, ten seconds.</p>
<p>Ah! Perfect!</p>
<p>Okay, gentlemen... Suck my dick.</p>
<p>(all screaming, blabbering)</p>
<p>What the shit are you doing?</p>
<p>(all stop screaming)</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Frank.</p>
<p>You asked a question!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Frank, Mac, Charlie-- drink for five seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah, drink, drink, drink!</p>
<p>This is how we get psyched up before each level.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's our Maori war dance.</p>
<p>That's how we demonstrate intimidation.</p>
<p>Shows off our physical prowess!</p>
<p>All right, Dee, put two more minutes on the clock.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Gentlemen... Level One begins.</p>
<p>(bell dings)</p>
<p>Okay, first card is trivia.</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, answer this question correctly, we get the card.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If not, they get a chance to steal.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right, what is the greatest band in the world?</p>
<p>Chumbawamba.</p>
<p>Correct!</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Whoa! That's not trivia!</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>We made up all these questions, Frank, so there's gonna be a lot of opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, really, it's more of a memory game than anything else.</p>
<p>But drink.</p>
<p>Drink, bitch. Let's go.</p>
<p>All right, whatever.</p>
<p>Our turn. Our turn.</p>
<p>Here we go. Ready, Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles... Trivia!</p>
<p>Trivia!</p>
<p>I can do trivia, baby.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, and you definitely wrote this one.</p>
<p>Nice. Lay it on me!</p>
<p>Lay it on me!</p>
<p>Question: "Dennis is asshole. Why Charlie hate"?</p>
<p>I don't think I wrote that.</p>
<p>You definitely wrote this one, Charlie.</p>
<p>Who else would have written this?</p>
<p>I'm not remembering that.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I don't think I wrote that one.</p>
<p>Of course you did.</p>
<p>How many other illiterates are in the...?</p>
<p>Just throw out a guess.</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Pass, pass.</p>
<p>No, he didn't pass, he didn't pass.</p>
<p>Just throw out a guess.</p>
<p>Any guess, come on.</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie.</p>
<p>I can't think of one.</p>
<p>All right, chance to steal.</p>
<p>Because Dennis is a bastard man.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>I definitely wrote that.</p>
<p>That was it, right?</p>
<p>Two card, two cards, two cards.</p>
<p>I was mad at you about something, I wrote that.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The next card is Artistry.</p>
<p>And it's all play, so pay attention, guys.</p>
<p>All play, all play.</p>
<p>We can get it back.</p>
<p>"The artist from your team must draw the clue from the card on your teammate's back.</p>
<p>The teammate must guess the clue based solely on feel."</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>I'm going to pass the card over to the drawer.</p>
<p>I draw, I draw.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't want to have to read it.</p>
<p>Oh, this is hard.</p>
<p>All right, ready... and...</p>
<p>You guys ready?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...begin.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Hey, go.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, bird?</p>
<p>I'm not getting it, dude.</p>
<p>That's because it's impossible to draw.</p>
<p>I don't know how to dr...</p>
<p>Jesus, Dee, your back is so boney and crooked and all over the place, I can't get a flat surface.</p>
<p>Anger.</p>
<p>Let me have it.</p>
<p>Let Frank go.</p>
<p>Let me try it.</p>
<p>Oh, if only the answer was ribs.</p>
<p>Go, Frank, give me...</p>
<p>Kicking, kicking.</p>
<p>He got it.</p>
<p>He got it!</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Kicking, kicking.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgot about your stupid strange connection with each other.</p>
<p>We get the card, we get the the card.</p>
<p>Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.</p>
<p>No puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles.</p>
<p>Chance.</p>
<p>Chance.</p>
<p>This is a great one, Frank.</p>
<p>We stole this straight from Monopoly.</p>
<p>It could be good, it could be bad.</p>
<p>That's the chance.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Oh, it's like the best one.</p>
<p>"Take the money from everyone's pockets."</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Foo-foo, fork over, foo-foo.</p>
<p>That's the best card there is.</p>
<p>Frank, I don't know what you're so excited for.</p>
<p>Give me your money.</p>
<p>What, I'm on your team.</p>
<p>Frank, the card says "Take the money from everyone's pockets."</p>
<p>Everyone. You are everyone.</p>
<p>Charlie gave up his 50...</p>
<p>I got $500 in my pocket.</p>
<p>I'm not putting my money on the table.</p>
<p>You got to do it, dude.</p>
<p>Give it to me.</p>
<p>That's the game.</p>
<p>That's a part of the game, Frank.</p>
<p>Let me see that card.</p>
<p>No, if you're going to play the game...</p>
<p>Let me see that card.</p>
<p>If you're going to play the game...</p>
<p>Let me see the card!</p>
<p>That's not a part of the game.</p>
<p>Why don't you show him the card.</p>
<p>Let him see the card.</p>
<p>"Swallow this card whole."</p>
<p>Cheating! Cheating!</p>
<p>Cheating.</p>
<p>You've been caught cheating.</p>
<p>Time's up.</p>
<p>You've been caught cheating.</p>
<p>We're on the same team, dude.</p>
<p>Look, Frank, cheating is tolerated, it's accepted, it's like a big part of the game, but if you get caught cheating, they advance to the next level.</p>
<p>You ruined my scheme.</p>
<p>Well, you know, in his defense, you were trying to steal his money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was not the time to cheat, dude.</p>
<p>Enjoy that.</p>
<p>Only one card down.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it's too late now.</p>
<p>What's done is done.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>(both clucking like chickens)</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>To the Game of Games.</p>
<p>Yes, Frank, good, you're getting it.</p>
<p>Very civil.</p>
<p>Can questions now I ask that clock stop-ed?</p>
<p>Okay, just 'cause you jumble up the words doesn't make it not a question.</p>
<p>But the answer is yes.</p>
<p>When the clock is stopped, all rules are off and civility reigns.</p>
<p>They advance, do we?</p>
<p>Ah, yes, I'll explain it to you, Frank.</p>
<p>It can get a little confusing.</p>
<p>They are now in Level Two.</p>
<p>Which means they need only two cards to advance to Level Three.</p>
<p>We are still in Level One.</p>
<p>It's a goddamn mind boggler.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've never really understood it, but the point is, if Mac's telling you what to do, listen.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now at Level Two, there is no more cursing.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Big-time Level Two rule.</p>
<p>All right, where we at here?</p>
<p>Where we at?</p>
<p>Oh, gentlemen, it's time.</p>
<p>Oh, is it?</p>
<p>Kick it!</p>
<p>(all yelling, blabbering)</p>
<p>You flinch, you lose.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Didn't wince, all right.</p>
<p>Nothing. Not even a...</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Aw, come on.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The problem is his hands are like...</p>
<p>So tiny.</p>
<p>If Dee had gotten this, we could have just...</p>
<p>Obliterated those giant paws.</p>
<p>All right, I got him.</p>
<p>I'm going to put it right in the center of his hand.</p>
<p>Do it, do it.</p>
<p>Cheese and crepes!</p>
<p>All right, hit him, hit him!</p>
<p>Dadgumit!</p>
<p>Let me have a go at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, here.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Wait for it.</p>
<p>Wait for it.</p>
<p>Cheese and crepes.</p>
<p>Son of a gun.</p>
<p>Cheese and crepes!</p>
<p>Dee, we'll be taking this card.</p>
<p>Cheese and crow.</p>
<p>All right, it's our turn.</p>
<p>Let's go get the cards.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>No, puzzles, no, puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles... Chance.</p>
<p>All right, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, could be good, could be bad.</p>
<p>"Go to jail.</p>
<p>Do not pass Go.</p>
<p>Do not collect $200."</p>
<p>Sam of a bush.</p>
<p>Okay, we take our pieces, we put them in jail.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Frank, see, you don't get it.</p>
<p>There's no jail on the board.</p>
<p>So you go in there.</p>
<p>You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>No, jail's a dog kennel.</p>
<p>You can get out, but you're not going to like how.</p>
<p>You got to eat a cake.</p>
<p>That's sounds good.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>You have to eat the ingredients of a cake.</p>
<p>Aw, shit.</p>
<p>One, by one... Oh! No!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Stop the clock!</p>
<p>Dude!</p>
<p>Aw, I hate this game.</p>
<p>I hate this game.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right, we drink for five seconds.</p>
<p>No, you're not getting it.</p>
<p>In Level Two, the other team counts.</p>
<p>Four... five.</p>
<p>(gagging and coughing)</p>
<p>Awful.</p>
<p>No more cursing.</p>
<p>No more cursing.</p>
<p>Get in jail.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>You might want to brush up on some of these rules while you're in there too, pal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Let him read the rule book.</p>
<p>All right, our turn.</p>
<p>Ooh, I'll play.</p>
<p>"Physical challenge--</p>
<p>The Grape Gobble."</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Grape Gobble's my thing, man.</p>
<p>Charlie's favorite board game-- Hungry Hungry Hippos.</p>
<p>Ready, set, go.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Go, Charlie, go, Charlie.</p>
<p>Put my cage on the bar so I can see.</p>
<p>Shut up, dog.</p>
<p>Gobble, gobble, come on.</p>
<p>Come on, Dee, go, go, go.</p>
<p>And time.</p>
<p>ho! ho!</p>
<p>That's time.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>It's only five.</p>
<p>I only got five.</p>
<p>Oh, sheets!</p>
<p>Bed sheets!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>You definitely got more than five!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>I ate, like, 12!</p>
<p>Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>You're not supposed to eat them.</p>
<p>Th-The rule is you're supp...</p>
<p>You're not supposed to eat them.</p>
<p>There's no way we can tell how many you...</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>We win the level.</p>
<p>We have Big Bubble.</p>
<p>We get the card!</p>
<p>Level three!</p>
<p>Level three now!</p>
<p>Wait, they're still inside me!</p>
<p>I can get them out!</p>
<p>Doesn't matter!</p>
<p>(Charlie retching)</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee and Dennis squawking)</p>
<p>Golden Geese!</p>
<p>Golden Geese!</p>
<p>(squawking): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>(Charlie coughs)</p>
<p>We move on to Level Three!</p>
<p>I hate this game!</p>
<p>I hate this game!</p>
<p>Oh, now this part.</p>
<p>Okay. Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Know this game.</p>
<p>Board flipping, cheating.</p>
<p>(all groan)</p>
<p>I'm so sick from that cake stuff.</p>
<p>Well, you shouldn't have even eaten it, man, 'cause the game's gonna be over in, like, a second.</p>
<p>They're gonna kill us.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I got a plan.</p>
<p>When I was in the cage, I had the books.</p>
<p>Save it, Frank.</p>
<p>There's no way we can beat them, okay?</p>
<p>They are tailor-made for level three.</p>
<p>Last time we played, Dee got "Emotional Battery," we berated that bitch for, like, two straight hours.</p>
<p>I mean, really personal stuff.</p>
<p>Way over the line.</p>
<p>The kind of stuff that cuts you to the core, you know.</p>
<p>She held it together without a single tear.</p>
<p>Dude, when her two minutes were up, she cried for a month straight.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was really sad.</p>
<p>Every day, crying all day long.</p>
<p>She talked about taking too many pills.</p>
<p>I think she tried to kill herself.</p>
<p>She did, she did.</p>
<p>I saw it, but I didn't tell you about it.</p>
<p>(slurring): Are you bitches ready for round three?</p>
<p>(slurring): 'Cause you're going down, clowns.</p>
<p>(rock music playing)</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee and Dennis screeching)</p>
<p>(slurring): Dennis, I want to tell you something.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I hope I get "Emotional Battery" this time, from them, because this is why-- you guys, you always emotional batter me.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna, I'm fine with it.</p>
<p>And I don't care about it.</p>
<p>I'm getting good at it now.</p>
<p>So that's something that I hope for this game.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me help you with that.</p>
<p>Oh, Frank.</p>
<p>Frank, come on!</p>
<p>Okay, so I broke another rule.</p>
<p>Oh, you did?</p>
<p>You broke a rule?</p>
<p>Don't rat us out if it's a rule!</p>
<p>Probably not a rule.</p>
<p>Let's keep playing.</p>
<p>It probably is a rule.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a rule.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>Rule 463: When a player spills his or her drink, his or her team has to chug the opponent's drinks.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You are a terrible, terrible teammate.</p>
<p>I don't want to chug hard alcohol on top of all this wine.</p>
<p>It's like... No, that's okay, you don't have to do it.</p>
<p>You don't have to, because you guys are in Level One.</p>
<p>You can't even drink hard alcohol, anyway.</p>
<p>You're trying to trick us.</p>
<p>They're trying to trick us 'cause then we'll not drink it and it'll be a rule that we had to drink it.</p>
<p>No, no, it's fine.</p>
<p>No tricking us.</p>
<p>Hey, we're playing the game.</p>
<p>We're playing the game.</p>
<p>It's Chardee MacDennis.</p>
<p>This tastes like water.</p>
<p>This is water.</p>
<p>Aha! I knew it!</p>
<p>Well... I knew it was water.</p>
<p>When he threw his beer in my face, I could taste it.</p>
<p>(slow-motion): Shut up, dog!</p>
<p>Cheaters!</p>
<p>Yeah... Cheaters.</p>
<p>You've been cheating!</p>
<p>We caught you cheating!</p>
<p>Eff you in the A!</p>
<p>Eff you in the A!</p>
<p>(Charlie yelling)</p>
<p>Congratulations, all right?</p>
<p>Fudge on crackers, all right?</p>
<p>Mr. Falconing sons of birds!</p>
<p>Mother fathers, you've caught us cheating for the first time in, like, 18 games.</p>
<p>If the team ahead gets caught cheating, then the team behind jumps to their level, which means...</p>
<p>Level Three!</p>
<p>Level Three!</p>
<p>Level Three!</p>
<p>(Mac and Charlie squawking)</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We've never been to Level Three before!</p>
<p>I'm going to Level Three!</p>
<p>I'll see you in Level Three!</p>
<p>Yep, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p>♪ The team going to Level Three We are the team going to Level Three... ♪</p>
<p>(alarm clock rings)</p>
<p>That was the buzzer.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>The timer's never gone off before.</p>
<p>Well, so what does that mean?</p>
<p>Wait, look that up, because you guys always win before the timer goes off, so...</p>
<p>It means we have to draw the black card.</p>
<p>I don't remember a black card.</p>
<p>There's a black card?</p>
<p>I don't remember.</p>
<p>I don't remember a black card at all.</p>
<p>Black-- guys, this could be some dark shit right here.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>This is gonna be a battle to the death.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Ooh, that's scary.</p>
<p>All right, read it.</p>
<p>Open it, open it, open it, open it!</p>
<p>Brace yourself.</p>
<p>Get ready.</p>
<p>Here I go.</p>
<p>Huh? What... I don't know.</p>
<p>Why... I don't know.</p>
<p>"In the event of a tie, a winner must be chosen.</p>
<p>There can be only one.</p>
<p>And so it comes to this: Flip... a... coin."</p>
<p>Flip a goddamn coin?</p>
<p>That's what we came up with?</p>
<p>Flip a coin.</p>
<p>That's lame as shit.</p>
<p>Oh, now I remember.</p>
<p>When we were writing the rules, at one point, we just got really bored, and we phoned it in.</p>
<p>That is so lame!</p>
<p>No, it's awesome.</p>
<p>Think about this, Mac.</p>
<p>They can't out-cheat us, they can't outsmart us.</p>
<p>This isn't about, like, physical endurance or anything like that.</p>
<p>This is just up to the gods right now, Mac!</p>
<p>And there's a 50-50 chance we're winning this whole thing, right now.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Tails never fails.</p>
<p>Tails never fails!</p>
<p>Tails never fails.</p>
<p>Frank, we're taking tails!</p>
<p>All right, all right, just flip the coin.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Flip that coin.</p>
<p>Flip that coin!</p>
<p>(chanting): Flip that coin!</p>
<p>Flip that coin!</p>
<p>(slow-motion): Flip that coin!</p>
<p>Flip that coin!</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee and Dennis grunting)</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Ah, that felt good.</p>
<p>Losers.</p>
