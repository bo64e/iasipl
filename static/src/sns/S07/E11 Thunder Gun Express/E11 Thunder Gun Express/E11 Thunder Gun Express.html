<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Dennis, do you have the tickets?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yes, affirmative.</p>
<p>I got the tickets on-line, and I got the last ones.</p>
<p>Charlie, got booze?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p>I think that's enough booze to last the whole movie, right?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>We're good, we're good.</p>
<p>Dee, time?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Uh, we have just about a half hour.</p>
<p>Precisely, you bitch!</p>
<p>I need to know precisely.</p>
<p>28 minutes! I'm sorry.</p>
<p>28 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, the city is like a zoo.</p>
<p>I mean, traffic jam like you wouldn't believe.</p>
<p>Obama's got the whole thing congested.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it, Mac.</p>
<p>I told you there was gonna be traffic, dude.</p>
<p>I forgot about Obama!</p>
<p>We still have time.</p>
<p>We still have time.</p>
<p>No, but, dude, traffic's gonna jam us up, man.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we can make it, okay?</p>
<p>Time for what?</p>
<p>Time for what?</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>We gonna go see <em>Thundergun Express,</em> man.</p>
<p>You know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>What the shit is a Thundergun?</p>
<p>Are you crazy, dude?</p>
<p>It's, like, the greatest movie ever made.</p>
<p>It's about this warrior from a post-apocalyptic underground society who has to travel back in time to save his lover from an evil robot army.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Whoo... "No hesitation."</p>
<p>"No surrender.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: No man left behind!"</p>
<p>It's only the biggest movie in America.</p>
<p>Whoa, that sounds the tits.</p>
<p>How? How?</p>
<p>No. You do not have a ticket.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn't buy me a ticket?</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What am I? Your daddy?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't just buy tickets for people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you what?</p>
<p>I'll take Deandra's ticket.</p>
<p>You don't like action movies.</p>
<p>I don't know, Frank.</p>
<p>This is just as much a love story as anything else.</p>
<p>Plus, I hear the guy hangs dong, and I'm very interested in seeing that.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he hangs dong.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What the hell am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, get out of the way, 'cause we gotta go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The clock's ticking.</p>
<p>Let's, let's go.</p>
<p><em>Thundergun!</em></p>
<p>This blows, dude!</p>
<p>Drive faster.</p>
<p>Drive faster?</p>
<p>Where would you like for me to go?</p>
<p>I'm surrounded by cars, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's all these goddamn immigrants come in to see Obama.</p>
<p>And none of them have any insurance.</p>
<p>That's why they drive so slow.</p>
<p>Why are you even here?</p>
<p>The movie is sold out.</p>
<p>I'm gonna scalp a ticket.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>I didn't bring my wallet.</p>
<p>You guys gotta spot me some dough.</p>
<p>(laughs) I ain't giving you shit.</p>
<p>Oh, I'll sneak in.</p>
<p>I sneak in all the time.</p>
<p>I just hope we get there in time to all sit together.</p>
<p>I don't like to split up.</p>
<p>Nah, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>If we get split up, we'll just yell over everybody to each other until they get annoyed with us and switch.</p>
<p>You call in a bomb threat, that would delay the picture.</p>
<p>That would be very <em>Thundergun.</p>
<p>We're gonna have to do something drastic if Dennis doesn't figure out a way to drive faster.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on, man.</p>
<p>Where would you like for me to drive?</p>
<p>He misses all of his angles.</p>
<p>Well, you can slide in front of that Prius.</p>
<p>Go in front of that Prius.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so then I'll be stuck in front of the Prius instead of right next to the Prius.</p>
<p>It's a bigger problem than that guys.</p>
<p>He's slow at everything.</p>
<p>You should see how long it takes him to bang chicks.</p>
<p>Mac, that's because you always try and barge in so you can see the chicks naked.</p>
<p>And then I have to start the process all over again.</p>
<p>But you waste so much time talking to them when you should be plowing them.</p>
<p>No, you don't get it, dude.</p>
<p>You don't get what I'm...</p>
<p>Look, I'm forging a connection with these women that will yield for them the most awakening and unforgettable sexual experience of their lives.</p>
<p>Whatever!</p>
<p>I don't care about any of this!</p>
<p>We're gonna miss the movie!</p>
<p>Yeah, come on.</p>
<p>Hey, Thundergun it up on the curb.</p>
<p>Yes, go on the curb!</p>
<p>Thundergun it all the way down.</p>
<p>Thundergun's not a verb.</p>
<p>Stop using it as a verb.</p>
<p>There's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>It's the man's name.</p>
<p>Just calm down. We'll get there.</p>
<p>Well, I tell you one thing.</p>
<p>I could walk faster than we're moving.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing?</p>
<p>Oh, wait!</p>
<p>Get back here, you sons of bitches!</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>Thundergun leaves no man behind!</p>
<p>We'll come back for you!</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>(horn honking)</p>
<p>(horns honking)</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>All the streets are blocked.</p>
<p>Hey, let's ask this cop.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Officer.</p>
<p>Uh, we need to get through.</p>
<p>I can't help you.</p>
<p>The street's closed down all the way to Spring.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is an emergency.</p>
<p>It's not my problem.</p>
<p>You gotta go around.</p>
<p>(grunts) All right, we gotta find a new point of entry.</p>
<p>Attack the target from a different angle.</p>
<p>Whoa! Hold on.</p>
<p>What are you talking about attacking?!</p>
<p>No, no, no, we're not terrorists or anything.</p>
<p>We're just... We're trying to get to a movie, Thundergun Express.</p>
<p>Oh, Thundergun Express,</em> huh?</p>
<p>You better get going.</p>
<p>You don't want to miss one second of that movie.</p>
<p>Is it that good?</p>
<p>It's the best goddamn movie I ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>(all groan)</p>
<p>Dude, hangs dong.</p>
<p>I told them that!</p>
<p>I told them!</p>
<p>I don't want to miss that!</p>
<p>All right, maybe we take a cab.</p>
<p>What about that?</p>
<p>A cab? Dee, don't be a fool!</p>
<p>We'll never get a cab out here.</p>
<p>Plus, we'll just sit in traffic like everybody else.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll be stuck like Dennis.</p>
<p>(trolley bell dings)</p>
<p>The trolley!</p>
<p>The trolley.</p>
<p>We can make it, Frank!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No surrender, baby!</p>
<p>Come on! Come on, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm coming.</p>
<p>Come on. You can make it.</p>
<p>I'm coming.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no!</p>
<p>I'm not gonna make it.</p>
<p>No, hop off!</p>
<p>Hop... Don't leave me here!</p>
<p>We'll come back for you!</p>
<p>You bastards!</p>
<p>(horns honking)</p>
<p>"You take too long.</p>
<p>You take too long, Dennis."</p>
<p>Screw you, Mac.</p>
<p>I don't take that long.</p>
<p>I'll show you who takes too long.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>We got Amanda, we got Brenda.</p>
<p>Ah, Alison.</p>
<p>Let's find out if Alison thought that I, that I took too long.</p>
<p><strong>Alison</strong>: Too bad the museum is closed on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I guess we can hang out here and get to know each other instead.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>(clicking)</p>
<p>What's with all the locks?</p>
<p>I want you to feel safe.</p>
<p>(tape fast forwarding)</p>
<p>So your father took off when you were pretty young, huh?</p>
<p>That must have been difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could probably speed things up a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean...</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>Careful now. There you go.</p>
<p>Watch your step, ladies.</p>
<p>Very good. Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, guy, can you... can you take me up the river?</p>
<p>I gotta get a mile up the river.</p>
<p>Tour is $15.</p>
<p>I left my wallet at home.</p>
<p>I only got a, I got a quarter to my name.</p>
<p>Look, I can't help you, pal.</p>
<p>All right, folks.</p>
<p>Everybody, take your seats.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>We'll get this tour underway, okay?</p>
<p>Hang in there.</p>
<p>I swear, I'll take care of you when I get up there.</p>
<p>Sorry, dude.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm your new captain, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm gonna take you up the river, okay?</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>What happened to Captain Tom?</p>
<p>Uh, Captain Tom turned out to be a goddamn junkie!</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>(passengers gasp)</p>
<p>You, uh, you're going too fast.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Too fast.</p>
<p>It's the, it's the fast tour.</p>
<p>It's the quick one.</p>
<p>Quick tour.</p>
<p>(men speaking native language)</p>
<p>Why aren't you telling us what anything is?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>What is that building over there?</p>
<p>Uh, that's a big building.</p>
<p>It's a brick building, red brick building.</p>
<p>I don't know that the hell it is.</p>
<p>It's a old building.</p>
<p>(clamoring in native language)</p>
<p>Can you please use microphone?</p>
<p>Very difficult for people to hear in back, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, the microphone.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. (spits)</p>
<p>You hear that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Well, we're on the Schuylkill River, and, uh, it's home to many, uh, weird fish-like creatures.</p>
<p>And also the depository of, uh, all of the unsolved crimes and murders in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>(group murmuring with interest)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That trolley kicked ass.</p>
<p>We're just like a couple blocks from the theater, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thundergun himself would have been proud of that move.</p>
<p>Of course, he'd be proud.</p>
<p>We didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>We didn't surrender.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We did leave a couple men behind, though.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But we didn't hesitate to leave those men behind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Plus, I hung dong on the trolley.</p>
<p>You guys missed that.</p>
<p>No, I didn't miss it.</p>
<p>I saw it.</p>
<p>I just chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>I saw it.</p>
<p>Looked like a button in a fur coat.</p>
<p>Either way, it was totally Thundergun.</p>
<p>If Thundergun's dong looks like that, we should all get our money back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm walking out of the movie.</p>
<p>It was more of a ding than a dong really, Mac.</p>
<p>I got a lot of good ones and thumbs up and...</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Another closure.</p>
<p>All right, think, think.</p>
<p>What would Thundergun do right now?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, hear me out.</p>
<p>Let's fire down that sewer.</p>
<p>Frank and I do it all the time.</p>
<p>I know my way around.</p>
<p>We'll be over there in a jiff.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Sewer, huh?</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>We've come this far, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Our clothes will get soaking wet.</p>
<p>It's going to ruin the whole movie.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>I know what it is.</p>
<p>He's scared he's going to be too fat to fit down that gutter.</p>
<p>That is what it is.</p>
<p>No, it isn't.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Look, sewers are disgusting, that's why.</p>
<p>Your big fat body is what's disgusting.</p>
<p>And you're embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>We are not going in the sewer, and that is final.</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>Oh, oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, come on.</p>
<p>Don't... goddamn it.</p>
<p>I'm coming through, guys.</p>
<p>Here I come.</p>
<p>Here I come.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>It turns out I-I am...</p>
<p>I am too muscular, and I-I can't fit through.</p>
<p>Look like you're stuck, huh?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>So my-my-my muscles stop me from gaining access.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mac.</p>
<p>Why don't you guys come out, and then...</p>
<p>I'll tell you what?</p>
<p>We'll come back for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's what I told Dennis and Frank, and I was lying.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>So are we...!</p>
<p>You sons of bitches!</p>
<p>Oh, you sons of bitches!</p>
<p>You sons of bitches!</p>
<p>Out of the way, you fat dickhead.</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>Think. Think.</p>
<p>Think. Think.</p>
<p>No surrender.</p>
<p>No surrender.</p>
<p>Shitty bike.</p>
<p>(car horns honking)</p>
<p>(rewinds tape)</p>
<p>(on tape): You seem cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'd be more comfortable under the covers.</p>
<p>Now, we're talking.</p>
<p>Okay, Alison.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, guys.</p>
<p>What are you do...</p>
<p>Mac, can we help you?</p>
<p>Goddamn, Mac.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, I thought I heard you call my name.</p>
<p>I did not call your name.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be right outside if you need anything.</p>
<p>We're not gonna need anything, okay?</p>
<p>If fact, go ahead and leave the keys in here.</p>
<p>Now I have to re-demonstrate my values, so that's gonna increase the time.</p>
<p>(locks clicking on tape)</p>
<p>I think I need to be getting home.</p>
<p>My mom is going to start to worry.</p>
<p>Wait. Your mom?</p>
<p>How old are you?</p>
<p>Sixteen.</p>
<p>Sixteen?!</p>
<p>No get... what are you... get... Whoa, shit.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>Why do I still have this tape?</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>(car horns honking)</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Well, now, this is an interesting development.</p>
<p>(mouthing)</p>
<p>I gotta say, Charlie, this sewer is pretty gross, but it's not nearly as gross as I thought it was gonna be.</p>
<p>No, it's no bad now.</p>
<p>But like any minute, you know, a wall of water could just come gushing through here.</p>
<p>So we should keep moving.</p>
<p>Wait, wall of water?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, it's not just water.</p>
<p>It's like dog shit and street sludge.</p>
<p>You know, they divert it to different channels throughout the day.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You know, it's sewage.</p>
<p>It's sewage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what, Dee?</p>
<p>Dee?</p>
<p>Can we get naked really quick?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I do?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, see the thing is, like, if a, if a wall of water comes through, it's actually pretty sweet to be naked 'cause then you can hold your clothes up.</p>
<p>You know, and then that piss and shit just kind of flows over you.</p>
<p>It's more refreshing than you think.</p>
<p>And then you have dry clothes afterwards.</p>
<p>And it's a lot better than having the sewage on your clothes.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>And I'm a little relieved, but it's still not good enough for, so I'm going to keep my clothes on.</p>
<p>Oh, look at Queen Dee, who's too good to get naked with her buddy all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't... why are you making it about that?</p>
<p>I just... I didn't want...</p>
<p>You know what? t?</p>
<p>This is a preposterous conversation we're having.</p>
<p>This is a functional conversation.</p>
<p>This is a preposterous conversation.</p>
<p>This is not a sexual thing.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let's just go.</p>
<p>Let's just go.</p>
<p>There's no walls of water.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>My shoe's stuck.</p>
<p>Well, pull it out.</p>
<p>If I could pull it out, would it be stuck?</p>
<p>Take your shoe off.</p>
<p>I'm not going to take my shoe off and walk around barefoot in this disgusting sewer.</p>
<p>Oh, the queen again, everyone.</p>
<p>The queen speaks.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Charlie, we don't have time for this.</p>
<p>I have an idea, though.</p>
<p>Why don't you take your shoes off and give them to me?</p>
<p>No, you'll stretch mine out.</p>
<p>No, come on, Charlie, you were fine taking all your clothes off and walking around in this gross place.</p>
<p>Dee, you'll stretch them out.</p>
<p>All right, Charlie, stop screwing around, okay?</p>
<p>We're going to miss the movie.</p>
<p>No, we're...</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'll come back for you.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>I'll come back for you.</p>
<p>Don't... don't you do that.</p>
<p>Don't you...</p>
<p>Charlie, get back here right now!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Aw, man!</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>(rumbling)</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Is that the wall of water?</p>
<p>No, Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie, I hear the wall of water!</p>
<p>Come back for me!</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>So they'll send a tow truck and everything?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>Tow truck is on its way.</p>
<p>I see you were born 1985.</p>
<p><em>Si.</p>
<p>Yeah, so everything checks out there.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, it's so cool that you own a chain of auto body repair shops.</p>
<p>I wish I new how to fix cars.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, auto body repair has always been a bit of a passion of mine.</p>
<p>I also invented Facebook with the Winklevoss twins.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg didn't do shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, he really screwed us on that one.</p>
<p>I got some hush money, so it's all good.</p>
<p>It's all good.</p>
<p>But, uh, I don't want to waste anymore time here, so...</p>
<p>No man left behind!</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Mac.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>I came back for you like I said I would, like Thundergun does.</p>
<p>Who's the brown girl?</p>
<p>Uh, Elena.</p>
<p>We got into a little bit of a fender bender.</p>
<p>She was on her way to see Thundergun,</em> too.</p>
<p>What are the odds of that, huh?</p>
<p>I seen it twice already.</p>
<p>Oh, it's amazing.</p>
<p>What's with the helmet, bro?</p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, <em>bonito.</p>
<p>Dude, the helmet is sweet as shit.</p>
<p>It's very Thundergun.</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>I'm going to wear it during the movie.</p>
<p>(car horn honking)</p>
<p>Looks like traffic is clearing up, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Punch it.</p>
<p>And Charlie and I, we go down the sewer.</p>
<p>And first thing we do is to preserve our clothes, we take... take our clothes off.</p>
<p>We get totally naked because you don't want to get wet.</p>
<p>We ball our clothes up.</p>
<p>We stick them up some place high.</p>
<p>There's this waitress who Charlie's in love with.</p>
<p>And, uh, I banged her.</p>
<p>Charlie got really upset when I banged the waitress.</p>
<p>Uh, but it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>She was a nice piece of ass.</p>
<p>We don't know who you're talking about.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>He's my buddy.</p>
<p>We sleep together.</p>
<p>We hang out together.</p>
<p>Once I pooped in the bed.</p>
<p>I blamed it on him.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>One time the guys got hooked on crack.</p>
<p>It was really crazy.</p>
<p>Well, they found a baby in a Dumpster.</p>
<p>They wanted to make some money with the baby, but nobody would buy the baby because it was white.</p>
<p>So they had to turn it brown.</p>
<p>We were fighting over the sword.</p>
<p>And just about when we were about to hit each other with the sword, Social Services came in, thought we were killing the baby.</p>
<p>I-I don't understand this tour.</p>
<p>Charlie wrote this musical.</p>
<p>Oh, man, it was really funny.</p>
<p>I played a troll on the musical.</p>
<p>A troll?</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And it's called <em>The Nightman Cometh.</p>
<p>I could sing you my song, if you like.</p>
<p>(speaking native language)</p>
<p>You gotta... you gotta pay the troll toll to get into this boy's hole.</p>
<p>Yeah, and, uh...</p>
<p>But you gotta pay to get in.</p>
<p>I was saying, "soul."</p>
<p>He thought I was saying, "boy's hole."</p>
<p>One of the things I like doing most is banging whores.</p>
<p>I, uh, I go out and bang a lot of whores.</p>
<p>Listen, here's the thing.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to jump off here.</p>
<p>So you guys enjoy the rest of the tour on your own, okay?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to get back to our tour bus?</p>
<p>That's your problem.</p>
<p>Welcome to Philly.</p>

<p>Coming soon to a theater near you.</p>
<p>All right, okay, there's a nice way to do that.</p>
<p>There's a nice way to do that.</p>
<p>From the director...</p>
<p>Ooh! Aah!</p>
<p>That's tart.</p>
<p>This seat taken right here?</p>
<p>Charlie, you made it.</p>
<p>What's up, Mac?!</p>
<p>I got a seat right in the middle, bro.</p>
<p>Aw, dude, that's an awesome helmet, man.</p>
<p>Thanks, dude.</p>
<p>Yo, where's Dee?</p>
<p>Uh, she couldn't make it, bro.</p>
<p>Wasn't Thundergun enough.</p>
<p>How about Dennis?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, he's here.</p>
<p>He's Thundergunning some Mexican chick in the back.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>He's moving a lot faster than usual, huh?</p>
<p>I think he's getting a hand job.</p>
<p>Oh, I am.</p>
<p>Hand job.</p>
<p>Hey, can you guys, uh, maybe be quiet?</p>
<p>Well, why don't you switch seats with us if it's bothering you so much.</p>
<p>Just switch seats, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Just switch seats.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Squeeze in, squeeze in.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee, you made it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you bet your ass I made it.</p>
<p>Charlie, my clothes are dry.</p>
<p>You held them over your head?</p>
<p>Took them all off.</p>
<p>Held them over my head.</p>
<p>I told you that water was coming.</p>
<p>No problem. Yeah.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Miss?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But your stench is unbearable.</p>
<p>It's bad, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That's shit in my hair, that's why.</p>
<p>What if you switch seats, and then I can be closer to those guys and you can...</p>
<p>Babe, let's get outta here.</p>
<p>We won't smell as much, and then you won't hear all the talking and...</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>This is a much better seat.</p>
<p>So the water wall came, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, came with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Dennis is getting a hand job in the back.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, congratulations.</p>
<p>Well, we're all here.</p>
<p>Except Frank.</p>
<p>I wonder where Frank is?</p>
<p>Okay, you got one phone call, make it quick.</p>
<p>Thank you, ma'am.</em></p>
<p>911. What is your emergency?</p>
<p>I'd like to report a bomb threat.</p>
<p>He's not qualified...</p>
<p>Would you shut up?</p>
<p>The movie's about to start.</p>
<p>Can you shut up?</p>
<p>Well, switch with us if you're getting so upset.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, why don't you go up there and then...</p>
<p>We're having a conversation.</p>
<p>Bad attitude.</p>
<p>Talk about shutting up.</p>
<p>[i]Dennis, you're going to like the seat.</p>
<p>At a certain point, it's your fault, you know what I mean, for not moving.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>This is Elena, everybody.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>(fanfare playing)</p>
<p>This is going to be bad ass!</p>
<p>(audience murmuring)</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Folks, please don't panic, but we've received a bomb threat.</p>
<p>We ask that you remain calm and exit the theater in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Bomb threat?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Bomb threat?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Frank.</p>
<p>He Thundergunned all of us.</p>
<p>He Thundergunned the shit out of us.</p>
