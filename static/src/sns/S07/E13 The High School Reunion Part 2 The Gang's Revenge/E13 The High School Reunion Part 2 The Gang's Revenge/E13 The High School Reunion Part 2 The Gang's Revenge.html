<p><strong>All</strong>: Reunion! Reunion!</p>
<p>Reunion! Oh!</p>
<p>Smash 'em up!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: This is great.</p>
<p>This brings me back.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>I'm, like, anxious, I'm excited.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: It's Adriano Calvanese, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's the guy who coined the name Aluminum Monster, but I've got a plan to get revenge.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Murphy</strong>: Yo, Dennis!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>That's Tim Murphy, the asshole that slept with my prom date.</p>
<p>Uh, this is my wife, Christie.</p>
<p>Dennis and I used to be really good friends.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Adriano made fake tickets!</p>
<p>Those tickets are fake!</p>
<p>Ronnie Rat strikes again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p>Ah! Goddamn... I don't have ringworm.</p>
<p>No, no, we're cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're like, the... Yeah. Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, really? Aah!</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Well, this is great, Dee.</p>
<p>This is just great.</p>
<p>Used to be king of the mountaintop.</p>
<p>Now I'm sitting alone at a table at my high school reunion with my sister, the Aluminum Monster.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, I was on the mountaintop, too, okay, Dennis?</p>
<p>(scoffs)</p>
<p>I got to find a way back there.</p>
<p>Got to get a plan.</p>
<p>Hold on!</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Ingrid! Ingrid Nelson.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Ingrid</strong>: Hi, Dennis and Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, carrying around a clipboard, huh?</p>
<p>Dork.</p>
<p>Fatty Magoo!</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Everybody, Fatty Magoo.</p>
<p>Honk!</p>
<p>What? Don't... What are you doing?</p>
<p>She's not fat anymore.</p>
<p>That doesn't really play.</p>
<p>It's not... Oh, really?</p>
<p>'Cause I'll see it on the sides, and I'll see it in the thighs.</p>
<p>Still fat to me, still fat to you, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo...</p>
<p>So, is this why you called me over here?</p>
<p>Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo!</p>
<p>All right, it was super fun to see you guys.</p>
<p>Right? Everybody, Magoo!</p>
<p>Did anybody...?</p>
<p>Did you guys...?</p>
<p>Did you see her?</p>
<p>Drop it.</p>
<p>Oh, God, she just wasn't that fat anymore, was she? Yeah.</p>
<p>No, she looks... That felt very forced.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause she's so pretty these days.</p>
<p>Doesn't...?</p>
<p>She looked fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, she looked really good.</p>
<p>Only kind of works when you're sitting at a table with the cool kids.</p>
<p>That seemed pathetic and mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was.</p>
<p>It did. It did. Wasn't it?</p>
<p>It was. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I got to find a way back into that group.</p>
<p>Dee, I think you need to stop focusing on how to get back <em>in with them, and start focusing on how to get revenge</em> on them.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're exactly right.</p>
<p>I need revenge <em>on</em> them.</p>
<p>And that's what I want, too.</p>
<p>Okay, well, what's our plan?</p>
<p>What's our plan?</p>
<p>Ooh, I want revenge.</p>
<p>All right, so here's-here's how we're gonna do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm gonna bang Tim Murphy's black wife.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>That'll do it.</p>
<p>That's gonna humiliate him.</p>
<p>That will humiliate him, yes!</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You know what I'll do?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>I will bang Tim Murphy to get back at Adriano.</p>
<p>Oh, that's a good plan.</p>
<p>What?! Yes!</p>
<p>The problem is, I don't think Tim Murphy would ever sleep with you.</p>
<p>Wait a sec. Hold up.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>What are you do...?</p>
<p>What's my part of the plan, then?</p>
<p>Hmm... Oh, grab this.</p>
<p>We only get two drink tickets.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Why am I hanging here?</p>
<p>The cool kids got us.</p>
<p>It was a massacre.</p>
<p>Ah, shit!</p>
<p>All right, you guys.</p>
<p>I'm ready to be your friend again.</p>
<p>No, Dee, get out of here.</p>
<p>Get away from us.</p>
<p>Get away from us.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Look, you guys, I'm on your team, okay?</p>
<p>I always <em>was</em> on your team.</p>
<p>I had a strike plan, but then Cricket went and blew up my spot.</p>
<p>You goddamn bitch!</p>
<p>Okay, look, that's not the important thing, all right?</p>
<p>bitch!</p>
<p>The important part is that I'm here now, and I'm on your team, and I want revenge, and I need you guys to help me come up with a plan.</p>
<p>She's right.</p>
<p>We need revenge, and I know how we're gonna get it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Charlie, we got to get the freight train back together.</p>
<p>Freight train?</p>
<p>That's a great idea.</p>
<p>That's like a plan.</p>
<p>Nope. No, that's not a great idea.</p>
<p>That's a terrible idea.</p>
<p>What the hell is a freight train?</p>
<p>It's a stupid group of imbeciles who called themselves a gang.</p>
<p>It was basically just Charlie, Mac, and Dooley.</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>God rest his soul.</p>
<p>And they were basically just lackeys of this guy named Psycho Pete, who genuinely was mentally ill.</p>
<p>Our conductor's insane.</p>
<p>Our cargo is pain.</p>
<p>Freight train!</p>
<p>Freight train!</p>
<p>Freight train!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Let's get a hold of this Psycho Pete and kick some ass.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Let's do it! Freight train!</p>
<p>Yeah, get us down.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>No, I don't like that plan, so... Huh?</p>
<p>Come on, get us down, Dee.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're gonna kick some ass.</p>
<p>Deandra, come back here.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Goddamn... (grunting)</p>
<p>All right, let's just see if they have Psycho Pete's name tag and if they were expecting him.</p>
<p>'Cause, if we get our psycho back, we get the freight train back.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What's his last name?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>No, me, neither.</p>
<p>Guess we weren't really that close.</p>
<p>It would have been cool to be closer to him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was such a dark, mysterious guy, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about this Peter Schmidt-- is that the guy?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, no, that's Schmitty.</p>
<p>Yeah, ah, shit, is he coming?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Schmitty would never come to something like this.</p>
<p>Not his scene.</p>
<p>If anything, he'll swoop in at the very end, grab the drunkest girl he can, take her home, bang her.</p>
<p>Ha, Schmitty's so cool.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Not that cool, though. Not as cool...</p>
<p>Way cooler than you, Dirtgrub.</p>
<p>Not as cool as Adriano.</p>
<p>Stop defending Adriano, okay?</p>
<p>Will you stop with the Schmitty stuff?</p>
<p>You know, snipping with each other-- it's, like... Oh!</p>
<p>Oh! Magoo!</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hey! I saw you trying to get by us.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You can't get away from us, Fatty, Fatty Magoo, Fatty Magoo.</p>
<p>No, I'm not fat anymore.</p>
<p>That's not even accurate.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Well, you used to be fat.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I'm not now.</p>
<p>I had a thyroid problem.</p>
<p>What's your excuse?</p>
<p>I've tacked on mass.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I've tacked on lots of mass, yes.</p>
<p>All right, all right, now, do you remember Psycho Pete?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>
<p>Any word on if he's coming tonight, or...?</p>
<p>Well, I hope not.</p>
<p>He's the reason we have extra security.</p>
<p>He threatened to burn down the building.</p>
<p>Ha. That's...</p>
<p>He was probably just joking.</p>
<p>That's his sense of humor.</p>
<p>He has a very dark sense of humor.</p>
<p>You know, you got to lighten up around Pete.</p>
<p>Was he joking when he cut his family into little pieces and ate them for Christmas dinner?</p>
<p>That doesn't sound like a joke.</p>
<p>Did that really happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds much more serious.</p>
<p>That's-That's grizzly.</p>
<p>Grizzly?</p>
<p>Psycho.</p>
<p>Psycho is how it sounds.</p>
<p>Psycho-- that's what it is.</p>
<p>Psycho.</p>
<p>That's how he got out of prison.</p>
<p>Oh, the insanity plea.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that makes sense.</p>
<p>I would have gone with that if I was his attorney.</p>
<p>Uh, although, really I specialize in bird law, so I don't want to mess around...</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>So, it was really nice to, uh... Okay.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>So I guess the freight train is gone, is that it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Yes, I guess we're of to... It's over.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, okay, hi!</p>
<p>Oh, good to see you guys again.</p>
<p>Change of plans, okay?</p>
<p>I can't think of my own thing to do, so I want to join the freight train or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Get lost, bitch.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Now, guys, the freight train never let a loser down in need.</p>
<p>If Dee wants in on the freight train, we have to let her in on the freight train.</p>
<p>Dee just has to do one thing.</p>
<p>She's got to go through the freight train initiation.</p>
<p>We got to know that Dee's one of us.</p>
<p>So, Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Are you willing to go through the freight train initiation?</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no!</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn!</p>
<p>Oh, no, no!</p>
<p>I am a grown woman!</p>
<p>I am a grown woman! Aah!</p>
<p>(pop ballad playing)</p>
<p>(groans): I mean, cuff links?</p>
<p>Tim, at a high school reunion?</p>
<p>It's not the Oscars.</p>
<p>I mean... Oh. (laughs)</p>
<p>Geez!</p>
<p>Yeah, and he can be a little <em>too</em> nice sometimes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Can get a bit boring.</p>
<p>Oh, trust me, Christie, he's boring as shit.</p>
<p>I know that, all right?</p>
<p>I'd rather get blasted in the balls by a battering ram than have to have a conversation with the guy.</p>
<p>You're crazy!</p>
<p>(laughing): Am I crazy? Am I?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He deceives people, Christie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's what he d... Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>He steps on his friends to climb to the top of the mountaintop, where his good friend used to reign supreme, that's what he does.</p>
<p>I mean, quite frankly, Christie, (laughs) I think you can do a lot better than him.</p>
<p>No, he's good to me.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, but does he appreciate you?</p>
<p>I mean, Christie, does he appreciate... all of that?</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Baby's got back, Christie.</p>
<p>Baby's got back.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>Am I right, though?</p>
<p>Am I right?</p>
<p>Listen, listen, listen.</p>
<p>I want to be inside you.</p>
<p>I want to do shit to you that is gonna make you realize what a worthless, boring piece of shit your husband really is.</p>
<p>Wait a second, I'm confused.</p>
<p>Why would you want to have sex with <em>me?</p>
<p>Why the hell wouldn't I want to have sex with you?</p>
<p>I mean, bam, boom, boom.</p>
<p>Because you're gay.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I'm not gay.</p>
<p>Dude, you're wearing makeup.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm wearing a little bit of makeup.</p>
<p>Who-who doesn't... And a girdle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanted to seem thin for the occasion.</p>
<p>That's not weird.</p>
<p>You've also been gossiping with me for the last 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I was speeding through the steps.</p>
<p>I have a system that...</p>
<p>I was demonstrating value on the dance floor, and then I engaged you physically when I put my hands on your hips.</p>
<p>Now, I'm nurturing your dependence by letting you talk shit about your boring, worthless, piece-of-shit husband.</p>
<p>Then I was gonna take you to an empty broom closet and I was gonna bang the shit out of you.</p>
<p>And then I was gonna neglect you emotionally.</p>
<p>That's what I do, Christie.</p>
<p>And it was working.</p>
<p>I was manipulating your feeble little brain into doing what I want-- what I</em> want!</p>
<p>And then now it's what you want.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Oh, ew! Yeah, aw, oh, yeah, okay, well, your husband is a liar, how about that, Christie?</p>
<p>Yeah, stay with a liar!</p>
<p>And a deceiver.</p>
<p>You... Tim does not deserve to be the king of the mountaintop.</p>
<p><em>I</em> am the king of the mountaintop!</p>
<p>(music stops)</p>
<p><em>I</em> reign supreme over everyone in this school.</p>
<p>I am the golden god of this place.</p>
<p>I reign supreme.</p>
<p>I!</p>
<p>I!</p>

<p>(chatter, music resume)</p>
<p>Dee, I'm sorry we threw your back out, but you're lucky that's the worst thing that happened.</p>
<p>And it's a lucky thing I brought the back brace.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, lucky! So lucky!</p>
<p>I'm feeling very, very lucky to have my asshole ripped in half like tissue paper by my father and his very good friends.</p>
<p>A-A-And also, I'm feeling incredibly lucky to be making another appearance as the Aluminum Monster after so many years.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank <em>you.</p>
<p>And I don't think you're gonna get to bang Adriano now, either.</p>
<p>Oh, you don't think so, Charlie?</p>
<p>You don't think so?</p>
<p>Guys, this whole thing has been a wash, all right?</p>
<p>Let's just get out of here, because there's no way that we're gonna get revenge on those guys without Psycho Pete.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've been humiliated enough.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>You bastard!</p>
<p>You bastard!</p>
<p>Whoa! Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>(Dennis yells)</p>
<p>Dennis, you're coming out hot.</p>
<p>(panting): I am the king of the minions, not Tim Murphy!</p>
<p>Not that jerk-off idiot!</p>
<p>He... jerk-off!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, man?</p>
<p>She rejected me.</p>
<p>Me, Frank, me!</p>
<p>The coolest guy in the history of this goddamn school!</p>
<p>Oh, they're all gonna pay.</p>
<p>They're all gonna pay the ultimate price!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee gasps)</p>
<p>Dude, what's all that stuff you're grabbing?</p>
<p>Tools!</p>
<p>Tools!</p>
<p>Uh, duct tape, zip ties and gloves!</p>
<p>I have to have my tools!</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>Well, why do you have a bunch of, like, weird tools in a hidden compartment in your car?</p>
<p>It's fetish, it's fetish shit!</p>
<p>I-I-I-I like to bind...</p>
<p>I like to be bound.</p>
<p>Uh, that's not important!</p>
<p>There has to be questions!</p>
<p>I'm not taking questions!</p>
<p>The golden god is not taking questions!</p>
<p>I am the golden god!</p>
<p>And I'm taking action.</p>
<p>I got to go. I...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second, Dennis, wait a second.</p>
<p>(Dennis groans)</p>
<p>I think we can help you, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, we can help each other.</p>
<p>We both want the same thing.</p>
<p>Revenge.</p>
<p>(Dennis panting)</p>
<p>You're gonna be our new Psycho Pete, pal.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>The freight train's back in service!</p>
<p>Let's get nuts in that school.</p>
<p>Let's get crazy, all right?</p>
<p>Come on, let's get some revenge here.</p>
<p>Train's coming.</p>
<p>Watch out for that train.</p>
<p>Watch out for that train.</p>
<p>The train's coming!</p>
<p>Make way!</p>
<p>Freight train coming through!</p>
<p>All aboard!</p>
<p>Choo-choo!</p>
<p>No, we don't do the toot-toots...</p>
<p>We're a train.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't we toot-toot?</p>
<p>It's just not what we do, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, bitches!</p>
<p>Get ready for the steam engine!</p>
<p>And get it!</p>
<p>I'm gonna destroy you all.</p>
<p>But I want Murphy first.</p>
<p>So let's go, Murphy, you and me, once and for all. Come on!</p>
<p>What you gonna do now, pussies?</p>
<p>We got our psycho back.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>Talking about the freight train, cowboy!</p>
<p>Look, everybody, the Aluminum Monster's back.</p>
<p>It's a good look.</p>
<p>Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, it's really good, it's really...</p>
<p>Just send Murphy out, so our psycho can bash him.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys, let's get out of here-- this is weird.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Where you going? You afraid?</p>
<p>(all mock crying)</p>
<p>No. We're not afraid; we're in our 30s.</p>
<p>We don't fight people anymore.</p>
<p>It's kind of pathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah? Well, too bad, 'cause the fury's already coming, bitch.</p>
<p>So too late.</p>
<p>Oh-ho-ho, you just couldn't stand it, could you?</p>
<p>You couldn't stand Dennis Reynolds... reigning on high!</p>
<p>King of all the school!</p>
<p>Master of everybody!</p>
<p>You couldn't stand it, so you had to turn everybody against me.</p>
<p>Dude, listen to yourself.</p>
<p>Nobody turned anybody against you.</p>
<p>You were never that cool to begin with.</p>
<p>Seriously, man, you would just come around saying weird shit about being a golden god or some other insane crap.</p>
<p>And referring to all of us as your minions.</p>
<p>You always acted</em> like you were better than everybody else, but then you'd just go and you'd hang out with Ronnie the Rat or Dirtgrub under the bleachers or behind a Dumpster or something.</p>
<p>It was... it was really weird.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if I wasn't the coolest guy in school, then why did you have to try and tear me down by sleeping with my prom date?</p>
<p>(chuckles): I didn't sleep with your prom date.</p>
<p>Yes, you did!</p>
<p>No, I didn't.</p>
<p>Ronnie the Rat did.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Ronald McDonald slept with your prom date.</p>
<p>Did he tell you that I slept with her?</p>
<p>I never would have slept with that chick.</p>
<p>She was <em>gross.</p>
<p>She was gross.</p>
<p>(quietly): She was</em> gross.</p>
<p>She was gross, I remember that, yeah.</p>
<p>She was really gross.</p>
<p>You slept with my prom date?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How could you do that to me?</p>
<p>It was very easy.</p>
<p>Uh, she was a whore.</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill you.</p>
<p>No, don't.</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill you!</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill you, you fat piece of shit!</p>
<p>This is mass!</p>
<p>This is mass!</p>
<p>Don't make it about my weight!</p>
<p>You guys are good. So... Take care!</p>
<p>I know she was a whore, but she was <em>my</em> whore!</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>Calm down!</p>
<p>This is pathetic.</p>
<p>This is awful.</p>
<p>We've all been humiliated.</p>
<p>Our asses are destroyed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And Dennis turned out to be a loser.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let's just go back to the bar, right?</p>
<p>The bar's where we belong.</p>
<p>The bar's where we fit in.</p>
<p>We can hide from the world at the bar.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I agree with Charlie.</p>
<p>I never want to step foot in this high school ever again.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>We can't go out like that.</p>
<p>Look, if life pushes you down, you got to push back.</p>
<p>If you're dealt a bunch of lemons, you got to take those lemons and stuff them down somebody's throat until they see yellow.</p>
<p>And if some punk-ass kid humiliates you, you got to do the only thing that's left to do.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Yes, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, that was a great speech, man.</p>
<p>That's the most coherent thing that's ever come out of your mouth.</p>
<p>That was awesome, dude.</p>
<p>You usually just ramble on and on and on.</p>
<p>That was like a basketball coach.</p>
<p>All right, so what is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What's the one thing left to do?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, the thing of it is, is that, uh, there's the lemon stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you got Mac, who's a rat.</p>
<p>And Dee's body brace.</p>
<p>And, uh, and that's the thing of it, and...</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>No, you were gonna tell us what to do.</p>
<p>That doesn't... we didn't ask if something was good or if it wasn't good.</p>
<p>I lost my train of thought.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the bar.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Were you gonna suggest that we should do plan B?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Plan B!</p>
<p>That's what I was going to say!</p>
<p>That's... we're not doing plan B.</p>
<p>Listen, man, hey, listen.</p>
<p>We worked so hard on it.</p>
<p>Come on, we're not doing plan B, it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, plan B might be the only option we have left.</p>
<p>Ah, come on.</p>
<p>Come on, Dennis.</p>
<p>Jesus, come on, plan B is...</p>
<p>(chanting): Plan B, plan B... Shh, not too loud.</p>
<p>No, it's... All right, all right.</p>
<p>Will you stop whispering plan B like it's some super covert CIA operation?</p>
<p>Plan B is a dance routine.</p>
<p>It's a goddamned dance routine.</p>
<p>And it's gonna rock.</p>
<p>Beep beep.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Beep beep bop.</p>
<p>We're gonna need this dance floor...</p>
<p>Clear the dance floor.</p>
<p>Clear the dance floor.</p>
<p>Let's go, let's go.</p>
<p>Bring it on, bitches!</p>
<p>Go on!</p>
<p>All right, listen up, jerks!</p>
<p>Listen to us, listen to us.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of negative energy going on at this school, okay?</p>
<p>So I want to talk to you guys a little bit about dancing.</p>
<p>Now, back in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s, people used to dance all the time.</p>
<p>That's the way we solved our problems back then.</p>
<p>That's how they solved their problems-- through dance.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, we stopped dancing.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Grunge came in, we dressed in plaid and oversized jeans.</p>
<p>Then, later on, kids wore trench coats and shot each other in school, and that's not cool.</p>
<p>But guess what.</p>
<p>Guess what's going on in the high school now.</p>
<p>Kids are dancing again.</p>
<p>Organized choreographed dance.</p>
<p>They're doing organized choreographed dances to solve their problems.</p>
<p>They also give each other blow jobs.</p>
<p>They got these things called rainbow parties.</p>
<p>No, Charlie.</p>
<p>All right, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>No, but they have these rain...</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's not the point of the...</p>
<p>The point is, we're gonna show you a dance!</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Lights.</p>
<p>(music playing)</p>
<p>(crowd cheering)</p>
<p>(whistling)</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>(cheering and applause)</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>(beeping)</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Ah...!</p>
<p>(groaning): Ah...!</p>
<p>Ah...!</p>
<p>Five, six, seven, eight.</p>
<p>(music stops)</p>
<p>(Frank vomiting)</p>
<p>It's fine, it's fine.</p>
<p>Well, that was weird.</p>
<p>Hey, everyone!</p>
<p>After party back at my house, all right?</p>
<p>Everyone's invited.</p>
<p>Except them.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>What... (Frank coughing)</p>
<p>That sucked.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>It was a perfect dance.</p>
<p>They just didn't respond to it.</p>
<p>I don't understand how that didn't blow people's minds, though.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, we did a great job, okay?</p>
<p>Listen, don't, don't get down on yourselves, all right?</p>
<p>Those people are stupid.</p>
<p>They're idiots, they're savages.</p>
<p>They just didn't get it.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>(slurring): Hey!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>Wow, great dance, assholes.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Just like you low-life shits, I didn't get invited to the after party either, but whatever.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna have sex with somebody to feel better about myself.</p>
<p>I'm gonna bang the next person who talks to me.</p>
<p>So who's it gonna be?</p>
<p>Hi-yah!</p>
<p>How you doing, fellas?</p>
<p>Hey, Schmitty, excuse me.</p>
<p>How you doing, having fun?</p>
<p>Hey, did I miss the festivities?</p>
<p>Excuse... What are we doing here?</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Schmidt, no, no!</p>
<p>Hey, how are you?</p>
<p>Oh, do you want to have sex with me?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>See you, guys.</p>
<p>Monster.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>Where do you want to go?</p>
<p>You got a car?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>We'll use mine, come on.</p>
<p>Schmitty.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the bar, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Schmitty just... Schmitty.</p>
<p>Swooped in and grabbed the most disgusting girl here.</p>
