<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I know, but I can't believe I never even noticed this place before. I walk by it all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: How could you notice it?</p>
<p>There's no sign outside.</p>
<p>Yeah, what's up with that?</p>
<p>You think it like blew down in a storm or something?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: No, no storm.</p>
<p>I think the owners did it on purpose 'cause they think it's cool.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>They blew on their sign until it came off 'cause they thought it was cool?</p>
<p>I mean, who does that?</p>
<p>No, no, nobody blew anything.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee, how did you find out about this place?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Somebody sent me a link to their Facebook page.</p>
<p>Facebook-- that's why everybody's here.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Is this water?</p>
<p>No, it's gin.</p>
<p>Aw!</p>
<p>Gin?! I hate gin!</p>
<p>Get me a beer!</p>
<p>Get me a beer!</p>
<p>Get me a beer!</p>
<p>Beer!</p>
<p>It's a gin bar.</p>
<p>All they have is gin.</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You mean to tell me there's this many people in this joint-- all they serve is gin?</p>
<p>The only reason that people are here, is because Facebook tells them to come here.</p>
<p>This is the kind of shit we need at Paddy's.</p>
<p>Paddy's got no Web presence.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right.</p>
<p>The whole world is connected now.</p>
<p>It's all connected by Bill Gates and that rain man, Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>He and his Jews have connected the whole world, and now they're toppling regimes.</p>
<p>And Egypt and Japan and the Jews are all peaceful together...</p>
<p>Facebook is connecting everyone these days.</p>
<p>Even people in the Middle East.</p>
<p>That's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Hell, and look people are showing up to a bar that doesn't even have a sign, and serves only one old-timey disgusting drink that nobody likes.</p>
<p>Goddamn I hate gin.</p>
<p>Dee, you bitch.</p>
<p>That's the thing.</p>
<p>This place has got a good business model.</p>
<p>We have to emulate it.</p>
<p>That's absolutely right.</p>
<p>We have to get rid of all the beer in Paddy's.</p>
<p>We have to blow the sign off of the building-- you know, maybe I'll do the blowing, that's fine.</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie, stop, stop, stop, stop.</p>
<p>Do you think a human being can blow a sign off of a building?</p>
<p>I didn't until Mac said it.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>A man cannot blow a sign off of a building.</p>
<p>In Charlie's defense, you could loosen the screws, get up there and blow...</p>
<p>We are talking about the Internet.</p>
<p>(all talking at once)</p>
<p>You are derailing the conversation.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Ugh. Ew.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Okay, don't worry about it, okay.</p>
<p>Guys, we got to get on this.</p>
<p>He's absolutely right.</p>
<p>No distractions.</p>
<p>Paddy's needs to get connected.</p>
<p>Look at the Gin Bar's Facebook page.</p>
<p>They have like 50,000 friends.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Links to Twitter viral videos.</p>
<p>Their Web presence is a amazing.</p>
<p>We could do a viral video for Paddy's.</p>
<p>Well, we can't afford not to.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>We'll do a really cool video of how we serve gin in spaghetti cans or something like that.</p>
<p>And we take the sign down.</p>
<p>Frank, you're getting hung up on the wrong things.</p>
<p>The old booze and the no sign have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what kind of a douchebag walks into a bar just because it doesn't have a sign outside of it?</p>
<p>That's stupid, Frank.</p>
<p>Use your head.</p>
<p>But that's the most important thing-- exclusivity.</p>
<p>Weird drinks, no sign, that's cool.</p>
<p>Maybe so, but I like Paddy's sign, so it stays up.</p>
<p>I got the sign down.</p>
<p>And there's no way a man could have blown that off of our bar.</p>
<p>There's just no way.</p>
<p>You're totally wrong about that, Mac.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I never once said that!</p>
<p>You did not?</p>
<p>Okay, forget it, forget it.</p>
<p>Charlie, we're doing a viral video thing now, okay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Can I stop all this for one second?</p>
<p>I don't mean to derail us, 'cause this is very, very important stuff, but, um, I'm getting a little hung up on something.</p>
<p>The guy that shushed us last night-- is that bugging anybody else?</p>
<p>I've been thinking about that, too.</p>
<p>Have you been thinking about that?</p>
<p>I really have.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You were in the middle of telling Charlie to keep quiet.</p>
<p>I was telling him to be quiet, I was telling him to be quiet.</p>
<p>I tell everybody to be quiet.</p>
<p>I don't shush them like they're animals.</p>
<p>I use my words.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm going to go get the video camera.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Guys, you're normally very excited about making videos, all right?</p>
<p>Guys, let's just focus.</p>
<p>We have bigger fish to fry.</p>
<p>Yeah, let it go.</p>
<p>I can't let it go.</p>
<p>I can't let it go either.</p>
<p>I won't let it go.</p>
<p>I'm irritated by it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to let it go.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, but the viral video thing is very important.</p>
<p>We'll get to that.</p>
<p>And we'll pop a shush on the guy and we'll be right back.</p>
<p>Let's... Yeah.</p>
<p>You can just find the guy on Facebook.</p>
<p>That's where you find people these days.</p>
<p>You aren't going to find the guy on Facebook.</p>
<p>There's three billion people on there.</p>
<p>Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Yeah, you don't even know the guy's name.</p>
<p>We don't know his name.</p>
<p>Go on Facebook, magically find a guy.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughing)</p>
<p>Facebook.</p>
<p>Found him.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was friends with the Gin Bar.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's him.</p>
<p>That's him.</p>
<p>Facebook is amazing.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We are all connected.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We are all connected.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're connected.</p>
<p>So let's get back to business.</p>
<p>Uh, viral video.</p>
<p>Yeah, but now that I'm seeing his face...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I got to be honest...</p>
<p>It was very annoying last night that.</p>
<p>It pissed me off, all right?</p>
<p>Maybe we can just, you know, send him a friend request and then...</p>
<p>Yeah, see if he responds.</p>
<p>And then we'll get back to what we were doing.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, distracted.</p>
<p>Did he respond?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>How long does it usually take?</p>
<p>You know, it depends on if he's online or not.</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What if you hit it faster?</p>
<p>I mean, here's the problem with, like, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>You know, everyone says, oh, it's changing the world, but not in a good way, you know.</p>
<p>We're not connected with each other anymore.</p>
<p>Tweeting-- that's not having a conversation.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And then these people who do that shit, they hear you having a real conversation with your real buddies, your real pals, and they get all jealous and pissed off and they want to shush you.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And you know what else is bugging me about this guy?</p>
<p>I cannot get past the fact that we're perfect strangers.</p>
<p>He doesn't know me.</p>
<p>I mean, for all this guy knows, I'm a psychopath with a trunk full of chainsaws, right?</p>
<p>He shushs me 'cause he doesn't like the volume of my conversation?</p>
<p>Next thing he knows he's chopped to bits in a basement somewhere, you know?</p>
<p>Was that worth it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I could be a man with a fist full of hammers... Right.</p>
<p>...and a trunk full of duct tape and zip ties.</p>
<p>You know, this guy doesn't know me.</p>
<p>Is he crazy?</p>
<p>It's very upsetting to me that he didn't consider any of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this is not a considerate man, Charlie.</p>
<p>This is a rude man, and they are very seldom the same people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, sir?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Can we get you for a second?</p>
<p>We've got a...</p>
<p>What can I get for you guys?</p>
<p>Well, we're looking for a man.</p>
<p>Yeah, this guy was a real douchebag.</p>
<p>He was in here the other night.</p>
<p>Yeah, douche-y looking.</p>
<p>Kind of douche-y.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish I had a picture of the guy, but we don't.</p>
<p>Oh, he's a shusher.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, right.</p>
<p>This is a douchebag who goes around shushing people that he doesn't even know.</p>
<p>Yeah, people who could have chainsaws.</p>
<p>Or hammers.</p>
<p>I mean, is any of this ringing a bell to you?</p>
<p>No. Sorry.</p>
<p>But I don't really see what the big deal is.</p>
<p>The big deal.</p>
<p>You don't see what the big deal is?</p>
<p>The big deal, sir, is that a grown man shushed me and my friend here.</p>
<p>We demand satisfaction from this person, okay?</p>
<p>We got to find this guy because we've got some important shit that we're trying to do on the Internet, or whatever.</p>
<p>We have much bigger things going on.</p>
<p>The sign is down, okay?</p>
<p>The sign is down.</p>
<p>He took our sign down.</p>
<p>It's never been down, you see what I'm saying?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm getting frustrated.</p>
<p>I'm also very frustrated.</p>
<p>Look, how would you like to be shushed?</p>
<p>Don't think I'd care.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>How'd that feel?</p>
<p>I mean, I was finished speaking.</p>
<p>Well, shh to you!</p>
<p>Again, I was done, so...</p>
<p>You're speaking too fast.</p>
<p>Stop speaking in such short sentences.</p>
<p>Then we can shush you in the middle and you'll know how it feels.</p>
<p>Okay, do you guys want a drink, or what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we want drinks.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, two house specials?</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Specials, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, two house specials.</p>
<p>Got interrupted.</p>
<p>How'd that feel?</p>
<p>On your away.</p>
<p>I think you got him with that one, though.</p>
<p>I don't exactly feel good about it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But he had to know how it feels.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you nailed him.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, I think I know how we can get a picture of this shusher guy.</p>
<p>What you thinking?</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Why won't this guy be our friend?</p>
<p>It's like an online shush.</p>
<p>You know, I... Okay, Paddy's Pub has over 30 friends at this point.</p>
<p>Why will this guy not accept our friend request.</p>
<p>He's too good for us?</p>
<p>Don't complain, just hit refresh again.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>I got the video camera.</p>
<p>All right, Mac, say, "I got infected."</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Say it.</p>
<p>I got infected.</p>
<p>Get that away from me.</p>
<p>Deandra, okay, now here we go.</p>
<p>Say, "I got the bug."</p>
<p>No, I'm busy, Frank.</p>
<p>Say, "bug."</p>
<p>Bug!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm shooting the virus thing.</p>
<p>What virus thing?</p>
<p>The virus thing that you guys said we were going to infect all our friends with on Facebook or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh! We got him!</p>
<p>We got him?</p>
<p>We got you, Dylan Toback!</p>
<p>You giant douche!</p>
<p>Are you guys gonna help me do the virus thing, or what?</p>
<p>We're busy right now, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're doing the shushing thing first, Frank.</p>
<p>But you said the virus video was the most important thing!</p>
<p>No, no! No!</p>
<p>We said the viral video is very important, and it is very important-- but we're on to this now.</p>
<p>You know, we'll do it later.</p>
<p>Why don't you get it started and then we'll come and fix what you did, okay?</p>
<p>All right, but hurry up.</p>
<p>Oh, check out these updates: "I am a man-whore.</p>
<p>I hate women.</p>
<p>I am a liar."</p>
<p>He admits that he is a liar.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Uh, looks like he is shopping for a silk sash at Tootie's, on South Street.</p>
<p>A silk sash at Tootie's?</p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Okay... Daddy got a new plan.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Daddy got a new plan.</p>
<p>Let's head down to Tootie's and we'll fire a shush right in his face.</p>
<p>We'll shush him real quick.</p>
<p>But we won't tell Dennis and Charlie, 'cause they mocked us.</p>
<p>Eventually, we'll tell them, though, right?</p>
<p>Well, we won't tell them right now, but we'll come back and we'll jam it in their faces.</p>
<p>Freeze!</p>
<p>Yeah, once we shush him.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>Great idea. Great idea!</p>
<p>I want to make sure you got the nose right, though.</p>
<p>That's the most important part to me, because it was an annoying nose.</p>
<p>It was an... It was a nose that you wanted to smack, yeah.</p>
<p>And then, give him, like, almond eyes if you...</p>
<p>You've already said that.</p>
<p>And don't compliment the man.</p>
<p>It's not a compliment from me, 'cause I don't like people with almond eyes.</p>
<p>I find it creepy.</p>
<p>All right, well, can we just take a look at the drawing?</p>
<p>Because we kinda need to get out of here.</p>
<p>You've done an excellent job.</p>
<p>Really good! Wow!</p>
<p>And what is your technique, sir, because I want to learn that.</p>
<p>That is... You know, the only thing that would help this, is if you had him do this gesture...</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>When the man assaulted us...</p>
<p><strong>Detective Larson</strong>: Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Kelly, I'm Detective Larson.</p>
<p>I'm gonna need to clear something up on your report here.</p>
<p>It doesn't... Yeah, we're good.</p>
<p>We're good, actually, 'cause we got...</p>
<p>It says here this was filed as an assault, but the only thing that you're claiming was that this man shushed you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was an assault.</p>
<p>Shushing somebody is not an assault.</p>
<p>There was more to it than...</p>
<p>He-- yeah-- it wasn't just shushing, though...</p>
<p>Yeah... And the reason it was an assault was because he was shushing our cries for help.</p>
<p>Right. This guy was raping us...</p>
<p>(clears throat)</p>
<p>Well... wha...?</p>
<p>He was raping you.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah... Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>The both of you?</p>
<p>No. You can't rape two guys.</p>
<p>No... no, no, no.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even necessarily classify it...</p>
<p>You know what happened was that he only raped my friend here.</p>
<p>I actually shook him off in time.</p>
<p>The guy never quite made it inside of me but, my friend here, yeah...</p>
<p>So he was only raping you?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah... yeah.</p>
<p>He, like, really, kinda made soup of your insides... No... n no, no.</p>
<p>He barely, he barely made it in there, so, trust me, I'm fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he bit his dick.</p>
<p>Not-- what?!</p>
<p>No, he did... He, he... the reason we were going to file as a rape was because he did make it inside me, but, like, just barely.</p>
<p>And the guy was super-small, so I'm fine.</p>
<p>And then I did get away.</p>
<p>Well, don't-don't-don't write any of this down.</p>
<p>Look, can we just drop the case?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We don't need to... We just need the drawing...</p>
<p>I don't even think about that, because if we have the drawing, we can find the guy.</p>
<p>We can dole out the justice, and I'll mend this guy's...</p>
<p>And then this never needs to go in any files anywhere.</p>
<p>If you and Mr. Reynolds are filing a false police report, there's no way in hell you're getting out of here with that drawing.</p>
<p>(sighs) All right, Charlie.</p>
<p>I got another plan.</p>
<p>How's that?</p>
<p>That's perfect.</p>
<p>That looks exactly like him!</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he wasn't in a dune buggy and he didn't have... No, he was not.</p>
<p>...a propeller on his head, like that, but...</p>
<p>I like the shushing, though.</p>
<p>You nailed the shushing!</p>
<p>Tootie's... Tootie's...</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Is that him?</p>
<p>That's him.</p>
<p>That is him.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Hey, Dylan Toback.</p>
<p>(both shushing)</p>
<p>Oh! Hey.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, ma'am.</p>
<p>Hi, ma'am.</p>
<p>Uh, we thought you were this guy, Dylan Toback.</p>
<p>He shushed us and...</p>
<p>And we were gonna shush him back, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We didn't think you were a man, per se...</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Okay, I did, too.</p>
<p>I did because of your hair.</p>
<p>Here's why: it's the hair and it's the cardigan, and it's the build...</p>
<p>It's the way you stand, and the broad shoulders.</p>
<p>But that's okay.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>There's nothing you can do about that.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>I'm still confused.</p>
<p>I'm very confused.</p>
<p>It's sort of a transgender situation.</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: Are you guys looking for Dylan Toback?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you know him?</p>
<p>He posted on Facebook that he was here.</p>
<p>Well, can you guys keep a secret?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I can... yes, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>That wasn't him, it was me.</p>
<p>I started a Facebook page to get back at him.</p>
<p>I'm his ex-girlfriend and he was the worst.</p>
<p>He was always, like, "Sally, send me money."</p>
<p>"Sally, mail me hair."</p>
<p>Mail him hair?</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and then he posted a bunch of naked pics of me online, and that was the last straw.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That's disgusting!</p>
<p>Naked pics online?</p>
<p>Where? Where did he post those?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>One of those disgusting ex-girlfriend porno sites.</p>
<p>Aw, those disgusting ex-girlfriend porno sites!</p>
<p>I mean, there's so many of them, though!</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Which one did he post it on?</p>
<p>Do you know where we can find him?</p>
<p>Oh, I can give you his address.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Great! Great!</p>
<p>Also, put down one of the sites that was...</p>
<p>Listen, do you want to come with us, and maybe get some payback?</p>
<p>(laughs): That's... well...</p>
<p>Here's the thing: he's never actually met me.</p>
<p>Well, the pics I sent were a little more flattering than I actually am, and so we just sort of had this online relationship.</p>
<p>Mm! Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>But the hair I mailed was mine.</p>
<p>That was real.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>This chick is douchier than Dylan.</p>
<p>Let's get outta here!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I'm not even gonna look for those nude photos.</p>
<p>I might.</p>
<p>I might, though.</p>
<p>I might.</p>
<p>Come on, man-- this guy's been in here.</p>
<p>He's got the annoying nose that you wanted to smack... Evil almond eyes.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, guys, I've never seen a cartoon character in here shushing people before.</p>
<p>Well, he wasn't in a dune buggy, he was...</p>
<p>Look, use your imagination.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's not a cartoon character, okay?</p>
<p>Would you just take this seriously?</p>
<p>I don't see how I could take this seriously.</p>
<p>He's not helping.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He's not going to be a help to us.</p>
<p>You're just going to be difficult, so just go get us more gin drinks.</p>
<p>That's all you're good for.</p>
<p>More of the gin.</p>
<p>God. All right...</p>
<p>Here's what I'm gonna do, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm going to write "Rude man who shushes, please call" at tat top, and then, at the bottom, I'll put my phone number.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right? And then we'll make a shitload of copies, we'll put them up all over town, and it'll act like a wanted poster.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, so you want the rude man to call you?</p>
<p>No, I want people to call me about the rude man.</p>
<p>But, if the rude man calls me that works, too.</p>
<p>That works, too!</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That's gonna work.</p>
<p>Now, hold on a second-- you're cool just putting your personal information out there?</p>
<p>Yeah! I'm absolutely cool with that, man, because I'm saying "connect with me."</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>See, that's what we're talking about-- people just don't connect these days.</p>
<p>I'm saying call me, let's have a phone conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't tweet.</p>
<p>Don't just tweet me, don't shush me-- you know, let's connect.</p>
<p>Let's have a connection, you know?</p>
<p>Don't be rude!</p>
<p>Let's talk about rude people.</p>
<p>Let's talk about people who do rude things, you know?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I guarantee you, people will respect this.</p>
<p>Okay, one little roadblock, no big deal.</p>
<p>But let's shush this guy and get out of here, because it's starting to get complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah. And what was happening back there?</p>
<p>Sending nude pictures of yourself?</p>
<p>That's just stupid, and that's desperate.</p>
<p>Yeah, and hair?!</p>
<p>I mean, sending hair-- that's just demented.</p>
<p>Well, the hair I don't really have a problem with.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What is the point of that?</p>
<p>You send your hair to a guy and, you know, you just give that guy a sense of you and your smells... and... you know... Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>(both shushing)</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>We're looking for Dylan Toback.</p>
<p>Is he around?</p>
<p>Oh, Lord...</p>
<p>I knew this day would come.</p>
<p>Um... come in.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee and Mac groan)</p>
<p>Okay, but listen, we don't have a lot of time, okay?</p>
<p>Um, a few months ago, my daughter Jamela bought me this brand-new computer, and she put it right here...</p>
<p>Speed up, speed up, speed up!</p>
<p>Okay, so, ever since Jerry got put on life support--</p>
<p>Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down!</p>
<p>Ew! I didn't see him there.</p>
<p>I've had nothing but time on my hands.</p>
<p>And I've been so lonely, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, well, does any of this have anything to do with Dylan Toback?</p>
<p>Oh, why is she doing that?</p>
<p>Um... I am Dylan Toback.</p>
<p>No, no, no... Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm...</p>
<p>Don't say that!</p>
<p>We don't have time for that, okay?</p>
<p>Is anybody online the person who they say that they are?</p>
<p>Okay, do you know how to find the real Dylan Toback?</p>
<p>Well, what I'm saying is he doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I made up the name Dylan Toback.</p>
<p>I've made up dozens of names.</p>
<p>I'm really good at it.</p>
<p>My real name is Catfish!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>What the hell is happening here?</p>
<p>Here's what I gather.</p>
<p>I think she went on the Gin Bar's Web site, found a picture of that guy and then made up a whole name and personality for him.</p>
<p>So we don't know the guy's name.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We don't even know if he's on Facebook.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>How the hell are we gonna find him?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Well, how did you find me?</p>
<p>Was it that Sally?</p>
<p>Because that bitch been getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>So you know Sally?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, Dylan knows Sally.</p>
<p>No, he doesn't, 'cause Dylan isn't real, and you know what?</p>
<p>Sally isn't Sally anymore; Sally is now Dylan.</p>
<p>And what about the nude photos? I mean...</p>
<p>This is not about the nude photos, Mac... Shh! Shh!</p>
<p>Don't you shush me!</p>
<p>Don't you shush us, goddamn it.</p>
<p>Don't disturb Jerry.</p>
<p>Disturb Jerry? I'm disturbed.</p>
<p>He should be disturbed.</p>
<p>This whole thing is disturbing, and if you shush me one more time I will put you in the ground.</p>
<p>Do you hear me?</p>
<p>Okay you know what? Dee, Dee!</p>
<p>We're losing focus, all right?</p>
<p>Let's just get back to the bar, we'll find the nude photos...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, let's-let's focus on the...</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>Don't you want your hair back?</p>
<p>Is that your hair, Dee?</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You're Carl Lundegard?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, what is the problem?</p>
<p>Are we not putting these in the right part of town?</p>
<p>We put them in every part of town...</p>
<p>(cell phone vibrates)</p>
<p>Oh, oh, here we go, here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, come on.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Saw that guy you were looking for.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great, okay, can you tell us where exactly the... Shh!</p>
<p>Uh, no, oh, you do not! Oh!</p>
<p>You... ugh! He shushed me.</p>
<p>Another one?</p>
<p>Yes, another shusher shushing me on the phone.</p>
<p>All right, maybe the poster is the problem because it says "Rude man who shushes please call..."</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So rude men are calling just to shush you.</p>
<p>This is prank calls.</p>
<p>Am I gonna have to change my phone number?</p>
<p>I mean, that's...</p>
<p>Yes, because you never want to put your personal information out there in the world.</p>
<p>It's like... People abuse it.</p>
<p>Yo! Did you find the guy?</p>
<p>No. He's unfindable.</p>
<p>We just hit a bunch of dead ends, right?</p>
<p>The guy is a ghost, I'm telling you.</p>
<p>I know! We tried to track him down on Facebook, but it got very strange.</p>
<p>Like, it was just a bunch of girls pretending to be boys, and Dee banged a o fat old black la, and then sent her hair.</p>
<p>Okay, that's not... Hey!</p>
<p>I did the video, and I sent it to all of Paddy's Facebook friends.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Frank to the rescue.</p>
<p>Oh, ho! Frank saves the day.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good work, Frank.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Check out what you got here.</p>
<p>Welcome to Paddy's Pub... the oldest pub in America.</p>
<p>Well, that's not true.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, I lied.</p>
<p>Everybody lies on the Internet.</p>
<p>He's right. Everybody out there is lying to get what they want; why can't we?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>We have a variety of old liquors served in strange containers.</p>
<p>We are packed with celebrities-- the fun ones.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>We also have cockfights and strippers.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>We don't have a sign, so good luck finding the place.</p>
<p>But if you do, you'll be lucky.</p>
<p>'Cause we also got donkey shows, Motley Crue and cake.</p>
<p>Awesome, awesome.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Frank!</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>That is awesome.</p>
<p>I got to hand it to you, I think I would go to this bar.</p>
<p>I would definitely go to that bar.</p>
<p>This is the best part, coming up.</p>
<p>So, spread the word to all of your friends: At Paddy's Pub, you're guaranteed to catch a...</p>
<p><strong>Deep Voice</strong>: Virus!</p>
<p>Just ask this guy.</p>
<p>I got infected.</p>
<p>Get it away from me.</p>
<p>Or her.</p>
<p>No, I'm busy.</p>
<p>She looks like she caught the...</p>
<p>Bug!</p>
<p>So spread this video to all of your friends, because it's a computer virus.</p>
<p>Virus!</p>
<p>Take it from me.</p>
<p>I am a doctor... Dr. Toboggan.</p>
<p>Mantis Toboggan.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You sent that to all of our Facebook friends?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They're gonna think they have a computer virus, Frank.</p>
<p>Wait, you're the ones who said we needed the virus video.</p>
<p>I said a "viral video,"</p>
<p>Frank. Goddamn it. Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, we never should've left him in charge.</p>
<p>See, the problem is we got focused on the guy.</p>
<p>We didn't help him with his...</p>
<p>This whole thing is a total mess.</p>
<p>I mean, absolutely nothing good has come of today.</p>
<p>No, we wasted all of our...</p>
<p>(whistles): Excuse me.</p>
<p>This is a bar, right?</p>
<p>We noticed you guys didn't have a sign out front.</p>
<p>Thought that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>You guys open?</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>Charlie, lock the door.</p>
<p>Come on in. (chuckles) Oh...</p>
