<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Well, okay, what would you do, Dee?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: I'm saying that if I were a cop, I would have an Uzi.</p>
<p>Well, but I'm saying that the police force would never issue you an Uzi, so now what?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: That's not her point, though.</p>
<p>That's not what we're talking about, that's not my...</p>
<p>Thank you, Charlie.</p>
<p>Listen, if you had the choice, would you choose to carry one gun that shoots one bullet or would you choose to carry an Uzi-- one gun that shoots a thousand bullets in one second?</p>
<p>Yeah, you're shooting bullets everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I agree with her 100%.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I mean, she's absolutely right.</p>
<p>Got people coming at you from every angle.</p>
<p>Frank, honestly, if you're going to join in the conversation, will you swallow your food and then speak?</p>
<p>It's disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah, hey, Frank, what are you eating over there?</p>
<p>A hoagie.</p>
<p>You are not eating a hoagie.</p>
<p>You are just jamming meats and cheeses inside of your mouth.</p>
<p>I like to make it in my mouth.</p>
<p>It tastes better.</p>
<p>Frankie?</p>
<p>Gino?</p>
<p>You piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>(both grunting)</p>
<p>I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!</p>
<p>Now, this is interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, do we break this up?</p>
<p>No, no, n-no, d-don't break it up.</p>
<p>I want to see how this whole thing plays out.</p>
<p>(grunting continues)</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay, well, that seemed to settle it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank, who the hell is this man?</p>
<p>My goddamn brother.</p>
<p>(Frank growls)</p>
<p>Frank, I had no idea you had a brother.</p>
<p>Yeah, what gives, Frank?</p>
<p>You told us your brother was dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, you said that he had his guts sucked out of his asshole through a hot tub drain.</p>
<p>You told that to my own niece and nephew?</p>
<p>Uh, well, technically, sir, he's not our father, which would mean you're not our uncle.</p>
<p>Yeah, we thought he was for a long time, and then as it turns out... You know what?</p>
<p>It's a whole thing, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, let's not get into it.</p>
<p>How could you do this to me, Frankie?</p>
<p>Do what, Gino?</p>
<p>You know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>You're trying to steal her from me.</p>
<p>She's my woman.</p>
<p>You stole her from me first.</p>
<p>Well, you stole her back.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, who the hell are you guys talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: The love of my life.</p>
<p>Well, this just got more interesting.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull up a seat and get into it.</p>
<p>This just got very interesting, Frank.</p>
<p>Why don't you walk us through this?</p>
<p>No, I'm not dragging this shit up again.</p>
<p>This is ancient history.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I think they need to hear this.</p>
<p>I think they need to hear what a liar and a cheat their father is.</p>
<p>Let me start at the beginning.</p>
<p>It was back in the '60s.</p>
<p>I'm gonna jump in for a second 'cause it sounds like you're about to launch into a whole thing.</p>
<p>Is it going to take a long time?</p>
<p>My attention span is very short.</p>
<p>That's a valid concern.</p>
<p>It'll take as long as it takes.</p>
<p>Ah... okay.</p>
<p>Well, we might pop in and out mentally.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, our generation-- it's like...</p>
<p>Yeah, you want to make it funny or something?</p>
<p>Give it some flair.</p>
<p>Okay, it was in the '60s.</p>
<p>(jazz playing)</p>
<p>If you were looking for me, you'd find me at a happening little jazz club on the north side of town.</p>
<p>It was an all-black joint.</p>
<p>Blacks played the best music.</p>
<p>Not that I gave a shit-- I got a tin ear.</p>
<p>It all sounded like a bunch of noise to me.</p>
<p>See, I was running numbers as a bookie for the club.</p>
<p>I'd take bets for the owner Reggie.</p>
<p><strong>Reggie</strong>: Yo, Gino.</p>
<p>He had a temper.</p>
<p>He also had a weakness for betting horses and a strength for losing those bets.</p>
<p>You see, Reggie owed me money, and when he came up short, I called in a favor.</p>
<p>I need you to hire someone.</p>
<p>I ain't hiring another one of your bimbos, Gino.</p>
<p>This bimbo is my little brother.</p>
<p>He's here every night for the music.</p>
<p>He's more Negro-ish than anybody else in this club.</p>
<p>Frankie.</p>
<p>Gino.</p>
<p>(Frank humming)</p>
<p>How would you like to work here?</p>
<p>Would I ever?</p>
<p>I love the music, sir.</p>
<p>He's just a kid.</p>
<p>How old are you, boy?</p>
<p>Nineteen.</p>
<p>shit, you don't look a day over 12.</p>
<p>I'll do anything.</p>
<p>I was looking out for my younger brother.</p>
<p>I was keeping him out of trouble.</p>
<p>I got Frankie a job and he loved it.</p>
<p>That was a shit job.</p>
<p>I was mopping up puke, I was busing tables and washing dishes.</p>
<p>It stunk.</p>
<p>♪ <em>So far, so good...</em> ♪</p>
<p>But at least I had that sweet music to keep me going.</p>
<p>♪ <em>So far, so good...</em> ♪</p>
<p>And then one night I heard the voice of an angel.</p>
<p>No, not her.</p>
<p>♪ So far, so good ♪<br />
♪ <em>So far, so good</em> ♪</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>♪ I thought by now You would be long gone... ♪</p>
<p>That's her.</p>
<p>♪ <em>So far, so good...</em> ♪</p>
<p>Boy, she was the cat's meow.</p>
<p>That was Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Got to stop you.</p>
<p>Good time to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, so... The love of your life was a black woman named Shadynasty?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Well, th-th-there's nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>Lots of things.</p>
<p>It's strange, it's strange.</p>
<p>It's just unexpected.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's strange.</p>
<p>Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Well, go on, though.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, so it was late one night, I was cleaning up, doing my usual routine.</p>
<p>(glass shattering)</p>
<p>Are you out of your goddamn mind?</p>
<p><strong>Shadynasty</strong>: I saw you with her.</p>
<p>bitch, if I want to be with another woman, I'll be with another woman.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, relax.</p>
<p>(overlapping shouting)</p>
<p>Relax, relax, be cool, daddy-o, be cool.</p>
<p>Gino, get this bitch out of my sight.</p>
<p>You just be cool, man, don't blow your top.</p>
<p>Breaking my dishes, bitch, goddamn.</p>
<p>Hey, Frankie here is gonna take you home and I'm gonna talk to Reggie.</p>
<p>He old enough to drive?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For a while, we drove in silence until I finally got the nerve to speak to her.</p>
<p>You got a huge set on you.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Pipes-- you got a great voice.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>You like black music?</p>
<p>Do I?</p>
<p>I'm gonna open a jazz joint of my own someday-- an integrated place where blacks and whites can get along.</p>
<p>No Orientals, though.</p>
<p>You got to have a dream, I guess.</p>
<p>And you're going to be my star attraction.</p>
<p>Child, I ain't nothing but a backup singer.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you're the real, true star, Shadynasty.</p>
<p>You just need a sky to shine in.</p>
<p>If I didn't know better, I'd think you were flirting with me.</p>
<p>White man. Get down.</p>
<p>Whoa, why were you shoving her head down?</p>
<p>You did not want to be caught out in the street in those days with a Negress.</p>
<p>They'd tear you apart.</p>
<p>Negress?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Whatever the proper word was.</p>
<p>Well, it's not that, it's a different word.</p>
<p>It wasn't that.</p>
<p>We're talking '60s terms.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, you used those terms.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have.</p>
<p>Did you open the club or what?</p>
<p>You bet your ass I did.</p>
<p>With hard work and perseverance.</p>
<p>Bullshit. We opened the club with my gambling money.</p>
<p>And that's when we became business partners.</p>
<p>The point is, we opened the club, and we named it after our star attraction.</p>
<p>Shady-nasty's?</p>
<p>Shadynasty's, asshole.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>He's out of here.</p>
<p>Is that how you spell it?</p>
<p>So business was booming.</p>
<p>♪ Like fire needs the air to breathe... ♪</p>
<p>Shadynasty was a star.</p>
<p>♪ Desire's coming over me I wanna please you, babe... ♪</p>
<p>And every night, it seemed like she was singing to me.</p>
<p>♪ Oh... sometimes it gets me... ♪</p>
<p>'Cause she was.</p>
<p>Frankie's dreams were coming true.</p>
<p>Mmm... But sometimes dreams come at a price.</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>Ain't this some shit.</p>
<p>Hi, Reggie.</p>
<p>How you doing?</p>
<p>Not good, Frankie.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>I gave you everything.</p>
<p>Then you go and take my best bitch.</p>
<p>I'm not anyone's bitch.</p>
<p>I left you, Reggie.</p>
<p>I'm with Frank now.</p>
<p>Oh, you with her now, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess that don't leave me with no choice...</p>
<p>...but to be a mature-ass adult about this shit.</p>
<p>I'm working on my temper.</p>
<p>But know.. that I strongly disagree with this!</p>
<p>She's your problem now.</p>
<p>Good luck, Frankie.</p>
<p>Gino, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Saving your life.</p>
<p>Run, Frankie.</p>
<p>(siren wailing)</p>
<p>No, don't...</p>
<p>The police carted off me and Reggie.</p>
<p>I got two years in the slammer and Reggie got six.</p>
<p>Wait. Why did Reggie get more years than you?</p>
<p>You beat the man half to death.</p>
<p>He was black.</p>
<p>Those were the days.</p>
<p>You sound like you yearn for those days, Frank.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm just saying those were the days.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, by the time I got out of prison, the '70s had arrived.</p>
<p>♪ I was searching for someone to love me Hold me close and put no one above me... ♪</p>
<p>Ah, bro, so good to have you back.</p>
<p>My brother.</p>
<p>I missed you, Frankie.</p>
<p>I really missed you.</p>
<p>Oh, I missed...</p>
<p>What the shit is that?</p>
<p>A little bump of coke.</p>
<p>Since when do you do drug?</p>
<p>Prison. It's the '70s, Frank.</p>
<p>Everybody does drug.</p>
<p>Gino, Gino, Gino, Gino, not, not... not in my club.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, drug are trouble.</p>
<p>I don't want no trouble.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>I got a gun for protection.</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>What are you doing with that gun?!</p>
<p>You take a gun out?</p>
<p>No drug, no guns... No trouble.</p>
<p>Hey, I could eat.</p>
<p>Give me something.</p>
<p>Help yourself.</p>
<p>Make a sandwich in your mouth.</p>
<p>It tastes really good.</p>
<p>I know how to do it.</p>
<p>I'm the one who taught you to do it!</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>This is insufferable.</p>
<p>Oh, my... Please, just continue.</p>
<p>I just wanted to make an honest woman of Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Settle down, start a life together.</p>
<p>I was building up the nerve to ask her.</p>
<p>I want those peas.</p>
<p>Let me see that.</p>
<p>Okay, all right... While I was busting my ass running the club, saving money wherever I could, Gino was just having one big party.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>No, no, I never danced with no guys.</p>
<p>Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.</p>
<p>No-no, no-no-no-no.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you how it went.</p>
<p>First off, I was banging babes left and right, left and right.</p>
<p>(moaning)</p>
<p>(sighing)</p>
<p>But my past came back to bite me.</p>
<p>Get lost, bimbo.</p>
<p>Gino.</p>
<p>Reggie, you're out of prison.</p>
<p>It ain't Reggie no more.</p>
<p>It's Hakim Mohamed.</p>
<p>What's with the getup?</p>
<p>Prison changed me.</p>
<p>I'm a Black Panther now.</p>
<p>We strong black men; we don't take kindly to you slingin' dope in our hood, you dig?</p>
<p>Are you threatening me?</p>
<p>You bet your ass I am.</p>
<p>But maybe this will change your mind.</p>
<p>(gunshot)</p>
<p>Ah, shit.</p>
<p>It's a goddamn petition!</p>
<p>What the hell?!</p>
<p>I thought he was pulling a gun.</p>
<p>All right, I'm going to take care of this, Frankie.</p>
<p>You got to disappear for a while.</p>
<p>Disappear?</p>
<p>Where am I going to disappear to?</p>
<p>We're going to get you to South America.</p>
<p>I got connections.</p>
<p>South America?</p>
<p>What about Shadynasty?</p>
<p>I'm gonna look after Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Frankie!</p>
<p>Shadynasty!</p>
<p>Frankie!</p>
<p>No! Shadynasty!</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>That's when I started my new life.</p>
<p>Colombia.</p>
<p>What a dump.</p>
<p>Gino scored me a job all right.</p>
<p>I was quality control for his Colombian cocaine connection.</p>
<p>I'd become everything I hated.</p>
<p>The only thing that kept me going was writing letters to Shadynasty.</p>
<p>I wrote her every night.</p>
<p>But I never heard back.</p>
<p>(echoing): Shadynasty!</p>
<p>I occupied my mind immersing myself in the culture.</p>
<p>Taking in the cuisine.</p>
<p>But mostly doing cocaine.</p>
<p>(snorting)</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>That part was a blast actually.</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>Weeks turned into months, and months turned into years.</p>
<p>(yelling)</p>
<p>But I had to wean myself off.</p>
<p>I was living life just going through the motions.</p>
<p>I knew I had to get back home.</p>
<p>(woman moaning)</p>
<p>Back to Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You shouldn't be calling.</p>
<p>It's too risky.</p>
<p>The little birdie wants to fly back to the cage.</p>
<p>It's too close to the stove.</p>
<p>There's too much heat.</p>
<p>The little birdie can stand the heat.</p>
<p>He wants to migrate home.</p>
<p>The little birdie can't come home on account of the attempted murder!</p>
<p>Why'd you say that, Gino?!</p>
<p>You used my name.</p>
<p>I'm going to hang up now.</p>
<p>And don't come home, Frankie.</p>

<p>She was my one and only.</p>
<p>You stole her from me.</p>
<p>You're stealing her from me.</p>
<p>I found the new love letters you've been writing to her, Frankie.</p>
<p>Talking about meeting up again and running away.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I haven't written to her in years.</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>They're all signed, "Love, your one and only."</p>
<p>I should have destroyed these, like I destroyed the letters from Colombia.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You destroyed the letters I wrote to Shadynasty?</p>
<p>I intercepted and I read every one of them.</p>
<p>They were poetry.</p>
<p>Each one was more beautiful than the last.</p>
<p>Too beautiful, though.</p>
<p>I couldn't let Shadynasty read them.</p>
<p>Not if she was going to stay with me.</p>
<p>But these letters-- these are smut.</p>
<p>"I want to be in you.</p>
<p>My dick is a raging bull for you."</p>
<p>And this one, here, "Meet me at the airport, Friday, at 5:00, Terminal C.</p>
<p>Love, your one and only."</p>
<p>You are trying to steal her from me, Frankie, and I ain't gonna let you.</p>
<p>Gino, Gino.</p>
<p>That's not me.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, I never wrote those.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm putting something together here.</p>
<p>She's at the airport right now meeting some dude.</p>
<p>So, like, if you want to try and get her back, you got to move.</p>
<p>Guys, it's almost 5:00.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to see this whole story play out.</p>
<p>It's appealing to the romantic in me.</p>
<p>I feel like I want to see it.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Let's go to the airport.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right, go.</p>
<p>This is the gate.</p>
<p>I don't see a black woman anywhere.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, there's her, but...</p>
<p>That's her!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Really? That is not at all what I was picturing.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>Shadynasty.</p>
<p>Frankie!</p>
<p>Oh, my word!</p>
<p>Oh, you're still as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I wrote to you every single day from South America.</p>
<p>I mean, I really feel like we could still be together.</p>
<p>There's still a chance for us.</p>
<p>Shadynasty, I'm sorry for whatever I did.</p>
<p>Please, don't go.</p>
<p>Don't choose Gino, choose me.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you choose me.</p>
<p>I have loved you all my life.</p>
<p>No, pick me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Our love was strong.</p>
<p>We were together.</p>
<p>Pick me, pick me.</p>
<p>Pick me, Shadynasty.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I pick him.</p>
<p>Ain't this some shit.</p>
<p>Reggie.</p>
<p>Reggie?</p>
<p>Whoa, everyone's a lot fatter than I was expecting them to be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Last time I saw you, Frankie, you had me sent to jail.</p>
<p>But I forgive you.</p>
<p>That's all in the past.</p>
<p>Reggie is your one and only, huh?</p>
<p>He was all along.</p>
<p>But because of you two, he was always in jail.</p>
<p>I could never be with him.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Mr. Mohamed?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Your name came up on a no-fly list.</p>
<p>I need you to come with us.</p>
<p>Oh, hell no.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to be getting on this flight.</p>
<p>Sir, please cooperate.</p>

<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Let's take him down.</p>
<p>Wait! Oh, hell no!</p>
<p>Times have changed!</p>
<p>It can't still be like this!</p>
<p>Leave him be.</p>
<p>Reggie?! No!</p>
<p>Did you call that in?</p>
<p>No, that just happened.</p>
<p>Oh... Guess times kind of haven't changed much, huh?</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, she looked like shit.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She did not age well at all.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did she ever look good?</p>
<p>She was never attractive.</p>
<p>I guess black can crack.</p>
<p>That's still... still kind of racist.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's racist.</p>
<p>Is anybody hungry?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm hungry.</p>
<p>I'm starving.</p>
<p>Well, let's go eat.</p>
<p>Hey, did Frankie ever tell you about the time that I threw him off the John Wanamaker Building?</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>He told us about that.</p>
<p>I can't-- I can't listen to another goddamn story.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear that story.</p>
