<p>Oh, that's it! I'm coming in!</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, shit!</p>
<p>I just opened up the old cut.</p>
<p>Why didn't you open the door?</p>
<p>It wasn't locked.</p>
<p>Come on, we got to get going.</p>
<p>You got any ice in there? Ow.</p>
<p>They put me in charge.</p>
<p>It's a gay pride parade or something.</p>
<p>( <em>refrigerator opens, closes</em> )</p>
<p>Can I use this sock?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>We're making a float for the parade, to rope in the gays.</p>
<p>Ow! But we only got 24 hours.</p>
<p>I'm gonna use this newspaper.</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> ) I stuff it up.</p>
<p>I plug it. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, you're gonna be our prize gay.</p>
<p>You're gonna dance on top. They told me to get you.</p>
<p>I told 'em, "I don't get the whole gay thing."</p>
<p>I drew the short straw, so here I am. Let's roll.</p>
<p>I-I don't want to do that, because I-I just...</p>
<p>I don't know where I fit in as a gay man, and it's starting to get to me.</p>
<p>Oh, Christ! <em>Now?</em></p>
<p>They give me one job and I got to deal with your feelings?</p>
<p>I-I don't know. I-I...</p>
<p>I'm not feeling very proud.</p>
<p>A-All right. Look, Mac, I never really got you.</p>
<p>And-and, to be honest, now that you're gay, I get you even less.</p>
<p>Nothing against it.</p>
<p>I just don't get it.</p>
<p>But let's try and work together, okay?</p>
<p>Help me help you, all right?</p>
<p>All right. I guess. Sure.</p>
<p>Okay. Let's go find your pride.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Where exactly are you taking me, Frank?</p>
<p>Your problem is you're only hanging out with straights.</p>
<p>I'm gonna take you to a club where you can meet a few guys, maybe snap you out of that funk you're in.</p>
<p>All right. I just don't know if I'm ready for a relationship, you know?</p>
<p>You're just scared, is all.</p>
<p>You got to meet a couple of normal gays.</p>
<p>And, by the way, when we're in there, you got to watch my back.</p>
<p>If one of these queens comes at me, I'm gonna go berserk.</p>
<p>Frank, you're a 75-year-old man with a face that looks like hamburger meat.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're safe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>L-Let's try to blend in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>techno music playing</em> )</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Jesus Christ, Frank.</p>
<p>Isn't this what all gay guys are into?</p>
<p>I-I don't think so, but, either way, I know I'm not into it.</p>
<p>A-All right, all right, relax.</p>
<p>Let's hit the buffet. We'll hang back.</p>
<p>We'll scope out the scene. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Okay? Ooh, look at that.</p>
<p>Ooh. This is a much better spread than they have at the straight orgie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't feel comfortable in here, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh. Hmm.</p>
<p>I know. That's why you got to jump in headfirst.</p>
<p>Go find some nice guys, smack you around a little bit.</p>
<p>I don't want to get smacked around.</p>
<p>That's part of the culture, Mac.</p>
<p>It's a very small subset of the culture.</p>
<p>And it's totally fine for these guys, but it's just a little too much for me.</p>
<p>Too... Ow. Oh, and this cut.</p>
<p>I got to take 'em out and restuff.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Goddamn, dude, that is disgusting.</p>
<p>Mm, I got to plug it. I got to plug it up.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You're putting it in the chicken?</p>
<p>Got to... Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you... Oh, my God.</p>
<p>No, I got to keep it plugged.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's spicy.</p>
<p>Ooh, there must be some hot sauce on them wings. ( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>They're buffalo wings.</p>

<p>Oh, look out. Incoming.</p>
<p>Um, how may we help you?</p>
<p>( <em>muffled shouting</em> )</p>
<p>Mac, unzip this thing, so we can find out what it wants.</p>
<p>Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p>Why? Because I'm straight?</p>
<p>No. Because you put your nose rags in the chicken.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, excuse me, Your Highness, I'll be more careful.</p>
<p>Hey, how much I got to pay you to let my boy Mac here take you for a spin?</p>
<p>I'm not a prostitute.</p>
<p>You do this for fun?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I'm never gonna get it. I'll never get this.</p>
<p>Why did I get this mission?</p>
<p>I... You see, I drew the short straw.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, let's go, Frank. I'm so sorry, sir.</p>
<p>That's it. ( <em>groaning</em> )</p>
<p>W-We'll be leaving. Frank, let's just go home.</p>
<p>No, no, no. No, Goldilocks, we're not going home.</p>
<p>You got to find that pride.</p>
<p>Okay, this place is a little too rough.</p>

<p>How are you sticking your neck out for me?</p>
<p>I'm running a real risk coming to a joint like this.</p>

<p>Well, help me out here, man.</p>

<p>No, no.</p>

<p>Well, I-I mean, not with your life, but with the life of your son.</p>

<p>Hey, if it's not a boy, you flush that shit out and try again!</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I'll flush that shit out, and you...</p>

<p>No. No, no, no. He look... Oh, God. No! Come on, man.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He looks like a monster, and <em>you</em> look like a monster.</p>
<p>We're not trying to invite a bar full of monster men.</p>
<p>We're-we're looking for high-spending gay men.</p>
<p>Yeah, but get Dennis to dance.</p>
<p>You can't get the straight man to dance.</p>
<p>The press would murder us.</p>
<p>The press doesn't give two shits about us.</p>
<p>Frank, it's 2018, and you're the only person who doesn't seem to understand gay culture.</p>
<p>That's true. That's true.</p>
<p>My head is swelling with blood.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie. We got to be there in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>All right. You know what?</p>
<p>( <em>Frank groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Um, Cricket, fine. You can dance. Let's go.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>Frank, can you at least drive the thing? Let's go.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>One. Two. Three.</p>
<p>Whoa. Ah, sh...</p>
<p>Ah, shit!</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank, that's a lot of blood. Is that from just now?</p>
<p>Oh, no. No, that's from earlier.</p>
<p>You-you see, Mac, I've been in agony the whole day, but I came to this realization that sometimes you got to let the blood flow in order to start the healing.</p>
<p>Some cuts you just can't plug up.</p>
<p>That's the same for you. You got this thing inside you, and you're trying to plug it up.</p>
<p>But you got to let that shit out.</p>
<p>You got to let it flow.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you're gonna be in agony for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So you're saying that if I dance on the float, that maybe I'll find my pride?</p>
<p>No. No, forget the float.</p>
<p>That's just doing it for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>You got to do something else.</p>
<p>I got you a couple things from the float that you can use. I paid off the warden.</p>
<p>They think they're seeing a Blake Shelton concert, and I put your dad in the front row.</p>
<p>All right, I just...</p>
<p>I just don't know if I can do this, Frank.</p>
<p>Mac, I don't get it, and I may never get it, but I do know you got to do this.</p>
<p>You said you want to tell your dad your way.</p>
<p>So now do it.</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> )</p>
