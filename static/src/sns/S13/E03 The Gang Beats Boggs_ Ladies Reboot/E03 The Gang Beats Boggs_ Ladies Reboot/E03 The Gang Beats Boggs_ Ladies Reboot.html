<p><strong>Artemis</strong>: <em>I'm confused. Wade who?</em></p>
<p>Wade Boggs. He's a Hall of Fame baseball guy who drank 70 beers on a cross-country flight.</p>
<p>We're gonna beat that record.</p>
<p>That's why I booked us these tickets.</p>
<p>Uh, I thought we were flying to Los Angeles for the Women's March.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. You are correct that this is an all-female flight on the way to the Women's March... ( <em>burps</em> )</p>
<p>...but I don't give a shit about that.</p>
<p>It's about the Boggs thing.</p>
<p>I didn't know it was an all-female flight.</p>
<p>That feels dangerous.</p>
<p>What are you... no, hey! Come on!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Can't smoke on an airplane.</p>
<p>Goddamn, when's the last time you flew?</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't get it. You already did this.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we do our own thing? Why are we copying the guys?</p>
<p>No, that's the whole point.</p>
<p>It's the same exact thing, but it's with women.</p>
<p>Right? So it's a new idea.</p>
<p>Okay, I just feel that if it's all with women, then it should be better.</p>
<p>Why can't we just do the same thing?</p>
<p>Because if we do the same thing then why are we doing it at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got to say I agree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, why can't we just come up with our own record to break?</p>
<p>Like some badass woman who could really throw them back?</p>
<p>You know, Judy Garland, Liz Taylor...</p>
<p>Joan Crawford...</p>
<p>Betty Ford!</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) No.</p>
<p>Those are all sad examples of alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>The Boggs thing just feels more fun, you know?</p>
<p>When women do it, it just feels sad.</p>

<p>Okay. So, last time, Mac was commissioner, but I figured I could do that and participate because women are excellent multitaskers.</p>
<p>What kind of plane is this?</p>
<p>How come the coloreds are allowed to sit up front with the whites and we're way back here?</p>
<p>Wow. I never heard you talk so much. Truly awful.</p>
<p>What is going on with her? Why is she so perky?</p>
<p>She ate all her nicotine patches already.</p>
<p>Ate them?! What? You're not supposed to eat them.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, there was a two-week supply.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) You know what? Who cares? Who cares?</p>
<p>In that case, since you're all hopped up, you be the commissioner. Okay?</p>
<p>Just mark everybody's shirts every time they finish a beer.</p>

<p>( <em>cheering</em> )</p>
<p>Hell yeah! Can't wait.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Two women pilots.</p>
<p>I'm getting out of here.</p>
<p>No, no, no. S-Sit down.</p>
<p>Sit down. You're not getting... everything's fine.</p>
<p>You're not getting off. Sit down.</p>
<p>We're in mid-goddamn-air. You know what? Drink your beer.</p>
<p>That'll calm your nerves. My goodness. Okay.</p>
<p>Keep going like that, we might have ourselves a real scrimmage.</p>

<p>I'm an alcoholic.</p>
<p>That'll do it.</p>
<p>Artemis, one? Only one? Come on.</p>
<p>Just feels lazy and uninspired to do exactly what the men did.</p>
<p>Let's at least beat a female sports star.</p>
<p>Ooh, I like that idea. Like who?</p>
<p>Secretariat?</p>
<p>The racehorse?</p>
<p>I like that. Let's beat a Secretariat.</p>
<p>Mm, I don't like that she was named after a secretary.</p>
<p>She should be a boss. But fine.</p>
<p>I don't get into this bathroom soon I'm gonna shit my pants!</p>
<p>Yes! Do it! See? That's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Gross-out humor. It's like taking the original to the next level. See? Nobody expects that from women.</p>
<p>It's so much more shocking, isn't it?</p>
<p>Give me that, give me that, give me that mark.</p>
<p>Oh. Here we go.</p>
<p>Yes. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I need two more beers.</p>
<p>We're out.</p>
<p><em>No problemo.</em></p>
<p>I planned for this.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. ( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>They don't check medical bags.</p>
<p>See? The guys didn't do that last time.</p>
<p>How's that for originality?</p>
<p>What-what the hell?</p>
<p>Where-where are my beers?</p>
<p>Oh, I had to make room for all my merchandise.</p>
<p>Just, uh, crystals, worry dolls, dream catchers, labia rings... your basics.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make big money in California.</p>
<p>With this crap?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's a land of sad, lonely, desperate women willing to pay any price for fake spirituality and clean orgasm.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay, look, I love a scam.</p>
<p>I-I love to scam pathetic, sad, lonely women.</p>
<p>But let's wait till we get to California.</p>
<p>For now, I need to get you drunk.</p>
<p>I need beers. Goddamn it.</p>
<p>All right. Hey, hey!</p>
<p>Hey, you! Servant!</p>
<p>Hold on a sec. Servant.</p>
<p>Oh, dear God.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>How do I keep winding up with you people?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Do I know you?</p>
<p>Do you...</p>
<p>I used to work at Guigino's.</p>
<p>And then I moved to Minnesota and I waited on you guys at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Nothing? Mm?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Forget it, forget it, forget it.</p>
<p>Nope. Nope.</p>
<p>What can I do for ya?</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>How come you're a man servant?</p>
<p>Shouldn't there be a woman servant on an all-female flight?</p>
<p>Well, it's "flight attendant," and I actually volunteered, because I think women have been disrespected for far too long and I wanted to honor them and be their champion...</p>
<p>Great. You're a soy boy beta cuck.</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Look, uh, we're doing the Boggs thing.</p>
<p>I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Wade Boggs.</p>
<p>Okay. Is that a person's name or...</p>
<p>Doesn't matter. Uh, listen, we're gonna need about 50 beers each, all right?</p>
<p>And you can put it on the Boggs account.</p>
<p>Just make sure you keep all the ladies in the white tees lubricated.</p>
<p>Okay. I'm afraid we don't have any beer, is the thing.</p>
<p>What? What did you say?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, in honor of the Women's March, we are serving pink wine.</p>
<p>So we only have rosé.</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cute. Great.</p>
<p>Uh, we'll take a shit ton of pink wine.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay. You're welcome.</p>
<p>Come on. I got news.</p>
<p>I do, too, and it's bad news.</p>
<p>I just found out Secretariat was a boy.</p>
<p>All racehorses are male.</p>
<p>I know, because I find them so attractive.</p>
<p>Well, that's messed up. Why-why woman horses can't race?</p>
<p>They should be able...</p>
<p>They can run just as fast as the boy horses.</p>
<p>That's not what we're ta...</p>
<p>They should march.</p>
<p>Pussies on the track.</p>
<p>Getting off track. That's not...</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong>: ( <em>chanting</em> ): Pussies on the track.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Pussies on the track.</p>
<p>Shut up! Stop it!</p>
<p>We should <em>not</em> drink in protest.</p>
<p>Stop! Shut up! Okay?</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>It's all right. It's all right, 'cause I got a new plan.</p>
<p>Okay? You guys need a female athlete?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>I happen to know that tennis great Martina Navratilova drank 70 beers on a flight to L.A., only to wake up the next morning and beat her rival, Chris Evert, at the California Open.</p>
<p>Mm, that's very impressive.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So now we're gonna try to beat Martina Tinatinova...</p>
<p>No, goddamn it! We're doing the Boggs thing.</p>
<p>We're still doing the Boggs thing, but you're gonna use Martina as your inspiration. See? Okay.</p>
<p>And we're also switching to pink wine.</p>
<p>How's that, Artemis, for switching it up? Trying new stuff?</p>
<p>You can't just change one small specific and call it new.</p>
<p>I changed three! The wine...</p>
<p>We're still copying the men.</p>
<p>...the athlete, and the bag!</p>
<p>I will drink anything that you put in front of me.</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Well, there you go. Did you hear that?</p>
<p>You happy? Okay, great.</p>
<p>So, we're all settled.</p>
<p>I just need to do a quick conversion because beer has a five percent alcohol content and rosé has a 12% alcohol content.</p>
<p>Oh, dear! Watching a woman do math scares me!</p>
<p>Okay, so every little airplane bottle of wine will equal 2.4 beers, so we'd have to drink 29.17 bottles of wine to equal 70 beers. Okay.</p>
<p>So let's just call it an even 29 to win. Good?</p>
<p>Nerd.</p>
<p>( <em>"Take Me Out to the Ball Game" playing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh... We're doing a good job on those guys, huh? Mmm...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We're tearing it up. Tearing it up.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. Whoo!</p>
<p>( <em>attendant button chimes</em> )</p>
<p>Man, it is sad that there are only chicks on this plane 'cause, I mean, I am all horned up.</p>
<p>Well, there is a-a male servant.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Hot?</p>
<p>No. Soy boy beta cuck.</p>
<p>( <em>grimaces</em> )</p>
<p>I know, but, uh, don't get distracted by that, okay?</p>
<p>The main reason I picked an all-female flight is because sex is how Dennis lost.</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis? I-I like to hear about Dennis.</p>
<p>Tell me more.</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>He and Frank, he... they made a side bet, you know.</p>
<p>See who could have sex.</p>
<p>And then Dennis ended up banging this disgusting person, and then he got off at North Dakota to avoid her.</p>
<p>He was... ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>He was the first one out.</p>
<p>So-so Dennis had sex on the plane, how-how many women?</p>
<p>Just the one. Again...</p>
<p>Hm...</p>
<p>...don't get distracted by that.</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna beat his record.</p>
<p>There's only one man on this flight.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I will figure something out.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Stop. Stop it, okay? Kno-Knock it off.</p>
<p>You're my Chris Evert. You're my rival, okay?</p>
<p>The only reason you're here is so that my hatred of you can fuel my desire to beat you, okay?</p>
<p>So I need you staying in the game.</p>
<p>Okay. Then I'm gonna beat you, you skank.</p>
<p>Yes. that is the spirit.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>The only way to beat men is by competing against other women.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>

<p>I'm about to beat all of 'em.</p>
<p>No. It's over.</p>
<p>I'm pulling the plug on your male hand-me-down plot.</p>
<p>As women, we deserve better.</p>
<p>We deserve our own story.</p>
<p>( <em>coughing, retching</em> )</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>That tea that I served was spiked with ayahuasca.</p>
<p>♪ We're talkin' baseball ♪<br />
♪ Kluszewski, Campanella ♪<br />
♪ Talkin' baseball ♪<br />
♪ The Man and Bobby Feller, the Scooter... ♪</p>
<p>( <em>retching, farting</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>It's coming out both ends.</p>
<p>( <em>retching</em> )</p>
<p>The maximum gross-out.</p>
<p>( <em>farts</em> )</p>
<p>So nobody saw that coming from women.</p>
<p>( <em>farting, coughing</em> )</p>
<p>God, wha... What is going on? I'm tripping so hard.</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> ) Where are we?</p>
<p>Are we in L.A.?</p>
<p>No. We're in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>And only those passengers deemed fit to fly will go on to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And you're not one of them.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait.</p>
<p>One more thing.</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bye-bye. Thank you for flying with us.</p>
<p>( <em>farting, moaning</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>tires screech</em> )</p>
<p>California, USA.</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
<p>Mmm...</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
