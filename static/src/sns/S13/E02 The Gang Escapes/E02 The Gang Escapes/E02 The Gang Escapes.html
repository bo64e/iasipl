<p><strong>Frank</strong>: You lock us in a room and then we try to escape. That's it?</p>
<p>Yes, that's correct. People all over the world do this.</p>
<p>We're one of 15 escape room companies in Philly alone.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm fully aware of this practice.</p>
<p>It's a highly sexual experience for people.</p>
<p>You'll get no judgments from us.</p>
<p>No. No, no, no. I'm sorry, this is not sexual.</p>
<p>It's not sexual. Then I don't know what this is.</p>
<p>You've not explained it.</p>
<p>Uh, well, it's a mystery role-playing game.</p>
<p>You solve puzzles in order to escape from a room.</p>
<p>It's really about seeing how well you work as a team, and it's also a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>This sounds very nerdy.</p>
<p>Is this a nerd thing?</p>
<p>It's definitely a nerd thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't do nerd things.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>It's not-it's not nerdy. It's not nerdy.</p>
<p>It's actually really fun.</p>
<p>That's why I set this whole thing up. You know?</p>
<p>It's fun. I've done one before.</p>
<p>You've done one?</p>
<p>With who?</p>
<p>My friends.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>What friends?</p>
<p>We're your friends.</p>
<p>All right, I did it alone.</p>
<p>She did it alone!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, it doesn't matter. It's fun.</p>
<p>So wait, wait a minute, so what's the prize?</p>
<p>If we get out of the room, what do we get?</p>
<p>Well, if you escape before your time is up, we will put your team photo on our website.</p>
<p>Just the picture?</p>
<p>That's it?</p>
<p>Just the picture.</p>
<p>That's the worst thing I've ever heard.</p>
<p>And it's not sexual?</p>
<p>I'm out. I'm out.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Come on. Why does there have to be a prize? Why does it have to be sexual?</p>
<p>Why can't men just do something for the challenge of it, 'cause it's fun?</p>
<p>Men don't do things just to do them.</p>
<p>Okay? We're busy running the world, providing for our families. All right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We need stakes. If there's no stakes, what's the point?</p>
<p>That's a good idea, though.</p>
<p>How about if whoever wins, you buy them a 20-ounce sirloin steak?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: That makes sense.</p>
<p>That could be fun.</p>
<p>As a man, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Well, okay, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Absolutely. Then it becomes a game.</p>
<p>You see, I get out of the room.</p>
<p>That means I win the game, the lady here, she takes me out for a steak, and then it becomes sexual.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Nope. No.</p>
<p>That's not how it works. So you have to win as a team...</p>
<p>You know what? Don't explain it anymore.</p>
<p>Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>â™ª</p>
<p>Ooh, hoo, hoo, this is gonna be so good.</p>
<p>Whoa, they really went all-out.</p>
<p>This might actually be kind of fun.</p>
<p>Aah! Whoa, ho, ho!</p>
<p>Oh, Dee!</p>
<p>Whoa, what...</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, I found something.</p>
<p>What are you screaming at, Deandra?</p>
<p>You didn't even find it.</p>
<p>It was right there on the table.</p>
<p>( <em>click</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Woman ( <em>English accent</em> )</strong>: Greetings and salutations, Detectives.</p>
<p>Who's that broad?</p>
<p>It's Amanda from before. She's just doing a bad British accent.</p>
<p>( <em>English accent</em> ): A tuppence to you, Amanda.</p>
<p>( <em>groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, now she's gonna do it.</p>
<p>Doth thou...</p>
<p>Give me this, 'cause you can't...</p>
<p>All right. Yeah, Amanda, um, if you do that accent, then Dee's gonna want to do it, and we hate that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So w-why don't you just go? You go.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda ( <em>English accent</em> )</strong>: You have arrived at 221B Baker Street, home of world-famous... um, excuse me.</p>
<p>You're not supposed to start searching yet.</p>
<p>I haven't started the timer.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda ( <em>normal voice</em> )</strong>: Oh, yes, you did.</p>
<p>I have cameras all over the room.</p>
<p>I can see and hear everything you do.</p>
<p>Oh, my bad. Okay, I stopped.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: No, you didn't. Again, I can see you.</p>
<p>Yeah, um, Amanda, she's not gonna stop, so why don't you just, um, uh, speed things along?</p>
<p><strong>Amanda ( <em>English accent</em> )</strong>: Oh, u-uh, Holmes is in trouble, and he needs your help...</p>
<p>Yeah, faster, faster.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, well, if you need a hint...</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what? Um, we're not... we don't like this at all. Um, why don't you just go ahead and start the game?</p>
<p><strong>Amanda ( <em>normal voice</em> )</strong>: Okay, fine, your time starts now.</p>
<p>( <em>beep</em> )</p>
<p>Oh! We're locked in. Here we go!</p>
<p>Oh, that's cool.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, she locked the door?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you not listen to the whole setup that the game nerd did?</p>
<p>That's what the game...</p>
<p>No, that's-that's no good.</p>
<p>I can't have that. I can't be locked in.</p>
<p>W-What's the code for the door?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: That's the whole point, Frank.</p>
<p>We're supposed to work together...</p>
<p>Shut up, Deandra.</p>
<p>I can't be locked in here.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: O-Okay, calm down.</p>
<p>You know, I was worried that this might happen.</p>
<p>Frank hasn't been locked up since the nitwit school, so he gets a little tight about it.</p>
<p>I brought some of that gum you like, buddy.</p>
<p>You want to chew on that? Want to chew on that?</p>
<p>It's gonna settle you down.</p>
<p>That's gonna calm his nerves.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right, hey, guys.</p>
<p>Uh, let's huddle up. Guys, listen, listen.</p>
<p>Frank, it's gonna be cool, man, we can do... we can totally do this. Okay.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm thinking: I think-I think we should actually split up into teams, and then when we find something, we come... we come back together, ( <em>smacking</em> ) and we put... we use the... collective brain power...</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Frank, that gum-chewing is insane.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The chewing of the gum. It's happening, u-uh, right in my ear. It's ludicrous.</p>
<p>That-that is the most irritating sound on Earth.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh! Guys, guys.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that since I've done this before, I should probably quarterback this whole thing.</p>
<p>Well, I spoke too soon.</p>
<p>That's the most irritating sound on Earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: And just, I can-I can walk you guys through how to get clues, what you're looking for, specifically.</p>
<p>Why don't you just go find the clues?</p>
<p>Thanks, Dee.</p>
<p>Help us out. Thanks, Dee.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Yeah. Thanks a lot, Dee.</p>
<p>Great, thanks.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Is she gonna be doing that the whole time, man?</p>
<p>Like, just chiming in... like, advice, and...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You know she is.</p>
<p>Did-did you hear what she said about being the quarterback?</p>
<p>Does she think she's the leader?</p>
<p>Everybody knows quarterbacks are men.</p>
<p>And honestly, like, I don't want to say it out loud, but a female leader? It's just...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Doesn't sit well, right? Doesn't sit well with me.</p>
<p>Gives me chills.</p>
<p>It feels, like, un-American, maybe?</p>
<p>Yeah. Bro.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: It's un-American.</p>
<p>Very un-American.</p>
<p>Is it? Is it?</p>
<p>Thing is, is like, we had a vote in America.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We almost had one, and then America was like, "Mm..."</p>
<p>No women.</p>
<p>We couldn't have been more clear about it.</p>
<p>Very clear.</p>
<p>( <em>quietly</em> ): I... I got a plan.</p>
<p>No, no, no, come on, you guys.</p>
<p>No, we're supposed to do this together.</p>
<p>We're supposed to do it... Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Ah... so-so much more relaxed without her in here.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: That's the move.</p>
<p>Both of 'em. I mean, the last thing we need is two women, "helping us"?</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>Why do you have a lock on the outside of your door?</p>
<p>Uh, well, that's... Don't ask. You... Look, the point is, th-there's a lock on the door, and there's no way Dee's getting out of there.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>All right, so now that we don't have those ladies squawking in our ears, let's get back to doing what men do best, and we strategize, okay?</p>
<p>So we need to come up with a game plan.</p>
<p>Yeah? All right.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>Yes. I know exactly what we should do.</p>
<p>I actually have a good idea.</p>
<p>Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait, don't interrupt me.</p>
<p>Here's what we do...</p>
<p>No, no. We go... No, no!</p>
<p>Mac, shut up.</p>
<p>Let me say my idea first.</p>
<p>No, it's really good, it's gonna get us out of the room.</p>
<p>I have a great idea.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Slow down, slow down. Okay.</p>
<p>Clearly, we're gonna have to designate a leader here.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh! Right.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>That's what men do.</p>
<p>What are we... That's what men... Right!</p>
<p>We-we figure out who's, uh, in charge.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>That's how things work.</p>
<p>I nominate Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yes, because he's the smartest.</p>
<p>Right, Dennis?</p>
<p>Uh, I-I am very smart, and it's not a bad idea to have me be the leader.</p>
<p>Plus, also now that you've said it, I feel like it can't be unsaid.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have said it, but it is true.</p>
<p>Uh... technically, Frank is the oldest, which makes him the smartest.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Dennis is, like, the smartest person I've ever met, and I've met, like, a hundred people.</p>
<p>Ooh, you know, that is a lot of people.</p>
<p>Well, I've met, like 105.</p>
<p>Now, why would you...</p>
<p>You have not. Where?</p>
<p>Whatever. Supermarket, mall.</p>
<p>Charlie knows a lot of people.</p>
<p>I know people.</p>
<p>I'll table it, I'll table it.</p>
<p>Why don't we break up into the two teams?</p>
<p>I'll pick my leader, you pick yours, and we can find our own clues.</p>
<p>Uh, you know what? That's actually a really great idea, because that creates a more competitive atmosphere, Okay. which is more conducive to the problem-solving abilities of a man. Huh?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I think he's right.</p>
<p>All right, fine. You and me? Want to split off?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You and me. Let's go.</p>
<p>Lose these bozos.</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) We need 'em? No.</p>
<p>All right, we're out of here.</p>
<p>Come on, follow me. I got a couple ideas, man.</p>
<p>He might-he might die.</p>
<p>He might die. Yeah.</p>
<p>Good luck, suckers.</p>
<p>All right. Hey, let's, uh, let's find some clues, buddy.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Dennis, I already found one, and I think it's significant.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>It's a heart-shaped lock.</p>
<p>Whoa, excellent find, buddy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>quietly</em> ): Excellent. Okay, the game is afoot.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) All right.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes.</p>
<p>Let's-let's keep this between us.</p>
<p>( <em>whispers</em> ): Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Nice, nice.</p>
<p>I won't tell them.</p>
<p>I-I'm terrified. I don't feel like touching anything in Mac's room.</p>
<p>Hey, don't touch the bike.</p>
<p>I'm not going near that.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>But we can't let them beat us.</p>
<p>Frank, Frank, Frank. Frank.</p>
<p>Just look. We don't...</p>
<p>Look no further.</p>
<p>'Cause when I was out there...</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>... I already found one.</p>
<p>Great! You didn't-you didn't tell them.</p>
<p>No, I'm not gonna tell them.</p>
<p>Because the most important aspect of a man's success is to never trust another man.</p>
<p>For sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well, w-what is it?</p>
<p>All right, check it out.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>A heart-shaped key.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Ugh!</p>
<p>Goddamn! Sons of bitches.</p>
<p>Amanda, what's the protocol when a team locks one of their team members in another room?</p>
<p><strong>Amanda ( <em>on walkie-talkie</em> )</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p>This has never happened before.</p>
<p>All right, well, what are they doing out there?</p>
<p>Not much. They've basically just been arguing about which one is in charge this whole time.</p>
<p>All right, well, have they found the heart-shaped lock and key yet?</p>
<p>They have, but they refuse to admit it to one...</p>
<p>Wait, how did you know about that clue?</p>
<p>Ooh, yeah, yeah. I've done this exact same escape room before.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's why I picked it.</p>
<p>I wanted to show them that I'm smart and I can solve stuff.</p>
<p>By cheating your way through a game you've already played?</p>
<p>Okay, don't judge me, nerd.</p>
<p>All right? I don't need that.</p>
<p>What I need is for you to get me out there so I can solve puzzles and be a star.</p>
<p>Okay, well, again, this is a team-building exercise.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you could tell them about the lock and the key, they'd let you out of the room.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right. I'm sure... And give them the satisfaction of unlocking it? No, thanks. Now, come on, sister.</p>
<p>We got-we got to stick together and solve this problem the way women do.</p>
<p>Let's approach it like women. Right?</p>
<p>Through cooperation we can find a way to emasculate the men whose attention we're seeking.</p>
<p>I don't feel comfortable with this.</p>
<p>Let's see how comfortable you feel in five minutes, when they get frustrated and start smashing all your shit.</p>
<p>It's not in here.</p>
<p>Yeah. Nope. Here either. You now what?</p>
<p>Let's-let's just... let's stop.</p>
<p>Let's just... Okay. We've smashed a lot of things here, and I'm not seeing a single key, which means the key's got to be in your room with Charlie and Frank. Now... Oh, damn it, Mac.</p>
<p>Stop-stop chewing so loudly.</p>
<p>I'm not chewing anything.</p>
<p>Well, I can't think. Okay?</p>
<p>I hear you chewing, and I can't think.</p>
<p>I don't have anything in my mouth.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>That's Frank in the other room. ( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>You know what that is, right?</p>
<p>That's a power play.</p>
<p>Frank's trying to assert his dominance over me.</p>
<p>It's a classic alpha move.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, it is?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Don't sit. Don't sit.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) You see, by constantly chewing so loudly, he's sending a very clear message that he is the head cow.</p>
<p>And, as we all know, the head cow's always grazing.</p>
<p>Aren't all cows female?</p>
<p>Well, that was a metaphor. Okay, you know... ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Mac, sometimes I'm just riffing.</p>
<p>Would you allow me to riff?</p>
<p>As the leader, can I riff? Can I riff?!</p>
<p>Ye-Yes, yes, yes. Yes.</p>
<p>All right, so the point is go get me some of that gum.</p>
<p>That was the point you were making? You want gum?</p>
<p>Well, yes, I need the gum. It sends a very important, subconscious cue that sets the tone for pack animals.</p>
<p>I need to assert myself to this monkey so that he'll submit to my will, and we can win the game and get the hell out of this place.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, Dennis. I'm very confused...</p>
<p>Don't sit down!</p>
<p>Yes. Um...</p>
<p>Just a clarifying question: are-are we monkeys or cows?</p>
<p>We're whatever the hell I say we are, okay?</p>
<p>I'm just riffing. Now will you go get my gum?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Anything?</p>
<p>No. Nothing.</p>
<p>Well, keep smashing, because whatever lock goes on the end of this key has got to be in here, somewhere.</p>
<p>I've smashed everything, I can't find it.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. How's it going?</p>
<p>Super great.</p>
<p>Super awesome, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah. Really good.</p>
<p>Super great. We're finding all sorts of cool stuff.</p>
<p>You know, probably gonna be out of this room in no time.</p>
<p>My leader's killing it over here.</p>
<p>You touched the bike?</p>
<p>No, I didn't touch your bike.</p>
<p>Didn't touch a thing in here that was yours, man.</p>
<p>Didn't touch one of your gross things.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Nah. You guys cool?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're cool. What's up with you?</p>
<p>Huh? We're good.</p>
<p>I'm so cool.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>What do you want? What do you want?</p>
<p>Yeah, what's up?</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>What's up? What's up?</p>
<p>Dennis wants some gum.</p>
<p>Oh, all right. Hang on a sec...</p>
<p>No, no. Don't do that.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's a power play, Charlie.</p>
<p>It is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How is it a power play?</p>
<p>It's a power play. Everybody knows that the head cow is always grazing.</p>
<p>Oh, that's true.</p>
<p>Wait, so that's, like, a real thing?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's what it is.</p>
<p>Makes sense. If you're a top cow, what, are you gonna not eat?</p>
<p>Now, I'm sorry, we can't help you.</p>
<p>A-All right. Well... I have info.</p>
<p>All right, well, what's your info?</p>
<p>First, give me some gum for Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh, hardball, huh? Okay, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>No, no, don't, don't, don't...</p>
<p>I'm gonna give you one shred.</p>
<p>Ooh! Oh, not cool dude!</p>
<p>Oh, I knew he was gonna do that.</p>
<p>I just didn't want to feel weak in front of Frank.</p>
<p>I-I want to be a big-deal cow, too.</p>
<p>Well, now I want to be a big-deal cow, and I want gum.</p>
<p>But don't eat all my gum, Charlie.</p>
<p>All right, well, what's your info? What'd you find out?</p>
<p>I found a clue.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Give me some more gum for Dennis.</p>
<p>No. I don't trust you.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>'Cause you're just gonna put it in your mouth and eat it again.</p>
<p>I won't. I promise.</p>
<p>Mm. His neck is high. Makes me trust him.</p>
<p>Good posture, bro. Okay. All right, I trust you.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>I knew he couldn't be trusted.</p>
<p>Oh, not cool, man.</p>
<p>Never trust another man in a negotiation, that's textbook.</p>
<p>Art of the Deal. Art of the Deal, bro.</p>
<p>Oh, you tried to tell me that. All right, Art of the Deal.</p>
<p>Art of the Deal, Art of the Deal.</p>
<p>Hey, look, we're getting somewhere, right?</p>
<p>We're in negotiation. That-that's good.</p>
<p>That's good, men being men.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>All right, well, tell-tell us what the clue is.</p>
<p>Why would I tell you? You already gave me what I want.</p>
<p>Because we both know what Dennis'll do to you if you come back empty-handed... He will scratch you silly, Mac.</p>
<p>Killer negotiation, man.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Yeah. Pretty sweet, right?</p>
<p>Art of the Deal.</p>
<p>Art of the Deal.</p>
<p>He was lying.</p>
<p>So what's up, what'd you find?</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>I think it's time for a summit.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my summit.</p>
<p>Well, it's not your summit. It's everyone's summit.</p>
<p>That's what a summit is.</p>
<p>The point is we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender.</p>
<p>Our surrender? Why would we surrender to you?</p>
<p>We know you have the heart-shaped lock.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Mac! You told them?!</p>
<p>( <em>exclaims</em> )</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>And we have all the leverage, because we have something you need, and we're not gonna tell you what.</p>
<p>The key?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so there goes your leverage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I don't think so.</p>
<p>For you cannot open a lock without a key.</p>
<p>And you can't do anything with just a key.</p>
<p>It appears we're at a standstill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, is anybody else wondering why we haven't heard Dee make a peep this entire time?</p>
<p>Goddamn it, you guys!</p>
<p>Why is no one answering me?!</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: I don't even think they can hear you.</p>
<p>Is there a chance your brother would've sound-proofed his room for some reason?</p>
<p>Ugh... Oh, no.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah, there is.</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis, you psychopath.</p>
<p>How long have I been locked in here?</p>
<p>( <em>rapid beeping</em> )</p>
<p>What the...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis ( <em>on laptop</em> )</strong>: Welcome, sexual conquest.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, you've pressed the button on the alarm clock, signifying your permission to begin the game.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>A digital copy of your thumbprint has been sent as your e-signature confirming your full consent for whatever may happen to you.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>We've also discussed the safe word.</p>
<p>Feel free to use it at any time... but, as we both know, from your Craigslist profile, you probably won't.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>( <em>exclaims</em> ) Oh! Oh, no!</p>
<p>Oh, my God. No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Remember, Come on, Dennis. if you're having too much fun, it ruins it for me.</p>
<p>Wh...</p>
<p>Ah, ah, ah.</p>
<p>You didn't say the safe word.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: This is insanely disturbing.</p>
<p>All right, you do it for a living.</p>
<p>Get off your high horse.</p>
<p>Dennis! Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: Okay, okay, maybe I can help you unlock the door after all.</p>
<p>What do you see in the room? What's the first clue?</p>
<p>No, no, you don't get it.</p>
<p>There's no going out that door, all right?</p>
<p>I-I know my brother better than anybody else.</p>
<p>The fact that his prisoner cannot escape is really what's getting him off.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Without that safe word there's only one way out of this room.</p>
<p>And that's doing something drastic.</p>
<p>( <em>all mumbling indistinctly</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>laughs, mutters</em> )</p>
<p>And no decision upon us.</p>
<p>So I will tarry forth with what we've said about...</p>
<p>Oh, gentlemen, uh, gentlemen, if I may.</p>
<p>As your newly elected speaker, I'd like to start by saying I henceforth relinquish any possibility of becoming team leader from myself.</p>
<p>So long as I am able to retain this excellent title, as speaker of the tribe.</p>
<p>Uh, do we all agree to these terms?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Then, as the time in the game is drawing close to an end, as is the flavor of our gum, I shall commence with the terms we've all discussed posthaste.</p>
<p>As we all know, we men possess both the lock and the key.</p>
<p>The turning of said lock and key shall give us the code to open that door and render us victorious.</p>
<p>The turner of said key should and shall be our team leader.</p>
<p>So the election of this leader is our top priority at this time.</p>
<p>Followed only by the power dynamic that falls underneath this leader.</p>
<p>And then, lastly, there is the matter of meat, and who among us gets to graze upon it.</p>
<p>Too far?</p>
<p>I'll dial it back a bit. I'll dial it back a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Back up.</p>
<p>That's very good.</p>
<p>Frank... as the purchaser of the meat upon our imminent victory, you have offered to award each one of us with our own 20-ounce sirloin steak, provided you bite yours first.</p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, as the possessor of the lock, albeit through unscrupulous methods, let us not have another scratch.</p>
<p>You shall bite your steak second, followed by Mac, the original finder of the lock.</p>
<p>And lastly, me, for I picked the shortest of the straws.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, but you were all kind enough to grant me the speaker position as to stop the incessant arguing that took place upon the picking of the straws.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Do we all agree to these terms?</p>
<p>Very good. Very good.</p>
<p>Then, gentlemen, on the count of three, we shall dispense of our chewables and commence with the turning of the key.</p>
<p>One... two... three.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will remind you that time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Frank, the lock and the key.</p>
<p>But before he opens it, I'd like to take a brief moment to recognize our excellent work as men...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm. navigating these difficult waters with ethics, with grace, with minimal violence.</p>
<p>But, above all, without compromise to our masculine identity by any admission of guilt, failure or weakness.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Hear, hear.</p>
<p>Ah, to us as men.</p>
<p>Ah, to us as men. Frank, uh, lead us to our victory.</p>
<p>Men.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>There's something inside.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh...</p>
<p>What is it? What is it?</p>
<p>A note.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>What does the note say?</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie laughing</em> )</p>
<p>"And so the game begins."</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I-I think this is only the first clue.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, shit. There's a whole shitload of instructions on what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p>Next? H-How many things do we have to do next?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p>Well, well, 20, 30...?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>There's like a hundred in there.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p>20, 30? How much time do we have left?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Two minutes.</p>
<p>Two minutes?</p>
<p>Two minutes.</p>
<p>We don't have time to do all those things.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Frank, Frank, you're in charge. What do we do?</p>
<p>I don't know what to do!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: You assholes!</p>
<p>Let me in!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p>Dee's out on the ledge.</p>
<p>She got out of your room.</p>
<p>Clever girl.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dee!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p>Come on, you son of a bitch. Let me in. I can help you.</p>
<p>Dee...</p>
<p>I can get you out of there!</p>
<p>Dee, be careful.</p>
<p>That ledge is really small.</p>
<p>Just let me in.</p>
<p>Stop! Stop the game!</p>
<p>She's gonna fall! Let her in!</p>
<p>You guys, you have to...</p>
<p>( <em>shouts, screams</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>all shout</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>( <em>thump, glass shattering</em> )</p>
<p>I am so sorry that this happened to you.</p>
<p>We've never had an injury before.</p>
<p>Well, I'll sue the shit out of them, Amanda.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do it. I hate them.</p>
<p>Okay? I-I... If they just would've listened to me.</p>
<p>I knew how to help them get...</p>
<p>( <em>guys chanting</em> ): Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!</p>
<p>Oh, there she is! There she is!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Woo!</p>
<p>Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!</p>
<p>There's our girl.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dee, you outsmarted them.</p>
<p>You won the game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You took a fall for the boys.</p>
<p>A-And you know what? That's what a quarterback does.</p>
<p>Sacrifices his... or her... body for the team.</p>
<p>You really were the quarterback.</p>
<p>I was...</p>
<p>I was the quarterback, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, you sure were. Yeah, no, you figured out the only loophole in my carefully curated and well-researched bondage facility.</p>
<p>You're the only person who's ever done that.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, the only one. The only one.</p>
<p>Yeah, game nerd. Now, take the picture.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, y-you said if we worked as a team and we escaped from the room, then you would take our photo for your website.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>But you didn't work as a team.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, yeah-yeah, we did.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely we did, 'cause we-we got out of the room.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I let you out.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, but it was before the timer went off, and you didn't specify how we get out, just that we get out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's on you, really.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>That's not on us. Okay?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Take the picture.</p>
<p>I don't see the problem here.</p>
<p>Just take the picture.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>Wait, before you do that.</p>
<p>Uh, Frank got steaks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Steaks for everybody.</p>
<p>Oh! Steaks.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody gets one, but Dee... you get to bite first.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>All right, take the picture, loser.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's go, let's go.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> )</p>
<p>One, two, three!</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Cheese!</p>
