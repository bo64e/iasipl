<p>We must still be in somebody's memory.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Like whose?</p>
<p>Like whose?</p>
<p>Don't copy me.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Wait. ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Frank, why do you have hair?</p>
<p>I've always had hair.</p>
<p>Bullshit, Frank. You have n...</p>
<p>You know what, we're in his head right now. That's why Charlie 2 was talking about wanting to go back to living with him.</p>
<p>It's insane; Charlie already went back to living with me.</p>
<p>We're not in <em>my</em> head.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Nah. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Then why are your legs so long?</p>
<p>My legs have always been long. It's a burden being tall.</p>
<p>Ah, bullshit, Frank. We're in your head.</p>
<p>Get us out of there. Come on, man.</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you couldn't let me have that memory?</p>
<p>No, Frank, because it wasn't a memory, it was a fantasy.</p>
<p>I liked the two me's. That was a really cool angle, though.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, fine, but th...</p>
<p>Can we not go there, please?</p>
<p>All right? For Christ's sakes, we can't even just sit around having memories without things getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Well, at least we're not being lazy, right? We're coming up with new stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, all right, okay, let's stop, okay? We-we had our fun, now we're back to reality, a-and let's just, I'd like to keep it that way, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, software update's almost done anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Okay, good, well... Wait.</p>
<p>Dee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Where's your cut?</p>
<p>What cut?</p>
<p>The giant, gaping cut that was-was just on your forehead.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Oh. I don't... I don't know.</p>
<p>Is she changing reality?</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't know what it means, okay?</p>
<p>But I do know that we're not back in the real reality, and that's not good.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Are we not? Like, are you sure she actually fell, that that actually happened?</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't know. I mean, this is so disorienting. I don't know.</p>
<p>Dee, snap us back.</p>
<p>I can't. I'm trying.</p>
<p>All right, all right, wha-what if it's not <em>that</em> much different?</p>
<p>You know? Like, what if this reality, the only difference is that Dee doesn't have a cut on her head?</p>
<p>Is that that big of a deal?</p>
<p>Yes, it's a big deal.</p>
<p>You're talking about never knowing which reality you're living in.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? We need to, we need to orient ourselves.</p>
<p>Um... Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Are you tall and handsome with a full head of hair?</p>
<p>I like to think so, but no.</p>
<p>No. Good. Okay, so, Charlie, is the waitress in love with you?</p>
<p>Aw, I had her for a minute, but no.</p>
<p>Great. Uh, Dee, are you a successful actress?</p>
<p>Oh, I could have been.</p>
<p>Dee, be serious! Yes or no?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mac, um, are you my roommate?</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay, well, so there it is.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>All right, Mac, it's clearly you...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>...so snap us out of it, man.</p>
<p>No. W-We're not in my head. I swear.</p>
<p>Yes, we are, man. We're in your head.</p>
<p>You're trying to alter reality.</p>
<p>Dude, if we were in my head, why would I not want you to be my roommate?</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Dennis, we're in your head, aren't we?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No. Why would we be in my head?</p>
<p>Dennis, everyone knows that the most annoying person in the world is Mac.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>So why would you ever want to live with him?</p>
<p>No, that's not... I... No, he's great as a roommate.</p>
<p>Is he great?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's great.</p>
<p>Name one way.</p>
<p>Yeah, easy. He, um...</p>
<p>Oh, your head, yeah! So yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, damn it, I was trying to, yeah, get rid of him.</p>
<p>So you don't like living with me, Dennis?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I...</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) no, I love having a roommate who spends three hours a day on a dildo bike.</p>
<p>Guys, see, this is, this is why I didn't want to do this.</p>
<p>You know? No good can come of it.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel good.</p>
<p>It has been kind of messy, like, you know, it's been confusing, for sure.</p>
<p>So let's just... we just... so now we just got to make sure we're-we're back in reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, but how do you ever know if you're in reality?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I think I got a top here under the bar. Yeah, I do. I do.</p>
<p>A top under the bar?</p>
<p>Top? What do you do with a top?</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Well, a top. Didn't you guys see the movie <em>Inception?</em></p>
<p>You know, they spin the top, and see, the thing is, if we aren't in reality, then the top will just spin forever.</p>
<p>But if it wobbles and falls, then you know you're back in reality.</p>
<p>Should we give it a spin?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do it. -Sure.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Seems like that's gonna go for a while, though.</p>
<p>It does, it seems like it's gonna...</p>
<p>Gave it a hell of a spin there.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Well, it's a good, it's a quality top.</p>
<p>( <em>phones chiming</em> )</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, our phones are updated.</p>
<p>Oh, for real?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p>Oh, sweet!</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Thank God we're back to normal.</p>
