<p>Whoa, man, what the hell happened to you?</p>
<p>It's a long story.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, did you do your superstitions?</p>

<p>All right, well, you better hurry up, man.</p>
<p>I'm doing it. Here it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: He's backing up in the pocket!</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: He's back again. He steps up.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Brady's backing up.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: He's hit. He stumbles.</p>
<p>Do it, do it now!</p>
<p>He's throwing!</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: He is going deep for the end zone, and it is... batted around... and incomplete!</p>
<p>And the game is over.</p>
