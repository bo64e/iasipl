<p>Yeah, I'll have a beer.</p>
<p>Of course I want a beer.</p>

<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Mac, that was amazing!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Did you like my "say cheese" line?</p>
<p>I didn't quite get that, if I'm being honest.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was a little bit confused by that as well.</p>
<p>It was a pun, 'cause I flung cheese in his face, you know?</p>
<p>No, I got that, but... Yeah, but-but that's not really a pun. No.</p>
<p>No, if you... if you had taken his photograph, and then you flung cheese in his face...</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>...that would be a pun.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're taking the guy's picture, you say, "Say cheese!"</p>
<p>That would've done it.</p>
<p>Should I go get a camera?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's missing the point.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>By now, everyone knows the remarkable story of Dee Reynolds, a government witness whose turn as a British butler was so convincing that it was spun off into the highest rated sitcom of all time. Today she is here to talk with us about her upcoming blockbuster <em>Mother Earth. Tell us more about it.</p>
<p>Well, this time I play a very beautiful woman. Uh, a warrior princess who saves the world.</p>
<p>It's already grossed over $900 million in presale tickets, but I don't care about that.</p>
<p>You know, I'm more interested in exploring truth through character. Amazing.</p>
<p>Yes. And I understand you've recently become engaged to young heartthrob crooner Josh Groban.</p>
<p>(Dee laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Josh Groban</strong>: When I found out that Mr. Covington was actually a chick, yeah, I had to have her. I mean, look at her. She's smart, she's sexy, she's hilarious.</p>
<p>(Dee laughs) She pops.</p>
<p>He likes his ladies to pop. That's true, Groban does like his ladies to pop. Isn't he cute?</p>
<p>Sing her that song you wrote for me.</p>
<p>Which one? The one you wrote for me.</p>
<p>Oh, God, put me on the spot. It's great.</p>

<p>Tell you what. (British accent): I've got the feeling we're gonna be together a long time.</p>
<p>(Josh laughs) That's how babies are made.</p>
<p>But they didn't stay together a long time, their marriage only lasting a shocking 17 minutes before Reynolds met a new man whom she claimed she had to have.</p>
