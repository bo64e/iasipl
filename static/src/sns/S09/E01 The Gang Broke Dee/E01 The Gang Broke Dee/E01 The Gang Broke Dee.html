<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dee, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I'm eating cake.</p>
<p>I can see that you're eating cake, but that's Frank's cake from, like, a month ago.</p>
<p>I threw that in the trash!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Dee, you're eating trash cake and smoking?</p>
<p>I mean, you know what you look like?</p>
<p>You look like...</p>
<p>Like a bird?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, of course you look like a bird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You always look like a bird.</p>
<p>But I was gonna say, uh, you look like a...</p>
<p>Like a, like a bird lady covered in bird shit eating cake?</p>
<p>Dee, slow down, all right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Let the man do this.</p>
<p>Let me do my thing.</p>
<p>You're jumping on my thing here.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You know what she looks like?</p>
<p>She looks like a bird that has no...</p>
<p>A bird with no tits and no ass?</p>
<p>Dee, let us handle...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I got one, I got one.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>She looks like...</p>
<p>Like a bird.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Was that it?</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>See? That would have been funny, Dee.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, Dee, don't...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You know, that's not fun.</p>
<p>Stop. Stop whatever this is.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, you guys.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Don't apologize.</p>
<p>That's just sad.</p>
<p>Fight back at us.</p>
<p>What's the point?</p>
<p>The joke's always on me, all right?</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's no fun unless you fight back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm just gonna go home.</p>
<p>Good, go home.</p>
<p>I hope you, uh...</p>
<p>You hope I get hit by a bus?</p>
<p>Dee, come on, that's...</p>
<p>What difference does it make?</p>
<p>I can't get any lower than I am already.</p>
<p>I might as well just throw myself in front of a bus though, because I'm so ugly I can't even get a bus to hit on me.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p>I'll tell you exactly what that was.</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Dee? Dee, are you dead?</p>
<p>Did you kill yourself, Dee, or...?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Dee, why is your door unlocked?</p>
<p>Do you realize how unsafe that is?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, Dee, this is truly pathetic, and you are really bringing us down, so we're gonna help you out.</p>
<p>We realize we may be in some ways responsible for the state you're in.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, so we got an idea though, okay?</p>
<p>We're gonna sign you up for an open mic night at a comedy club!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right? That's your thing!</p>
<p>And we're actually gonna support you, Dee.</p>
<p>And now that you don't care anymore, you're not gonna gag on stage.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, you're right in that sweet spot between, like, suicidal and actually dead, where most comedians, they thrive there.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was that thing you said about how the joke's always on you?</p>
<p>That could be a catchphrase.</p>
<p>Dee, look, I don't want to pile on here, 'cause you're clearly very close to killing yourself...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...but I got to say, I totally disagree with the guys on this.</p>
<p>I'm glad you've given up.</p>
<p>And I want to propose something totally different: I would like to find you a man.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yeah. A man to settle down with.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not talking about a smart man, not-not a handsome man, but a very, very average if not below average man to take you off of our hands forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Go with it.</p>
<p>Go with it?</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>You were not clear.</p>
<p>The thing. Whatever. Both.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Let's-let's do my plan.</p>
<p>The comedy plan.</p>
<p>Let's do our plan.</p>
<p>We're gonna do the comedy plan, all right?</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
<p>(breathing into microphone)</p>
<p>(hushed): Dude, she is gonna bomb so hard, and then she's gonna feel worse.</p>
<p>(hushed): It's okay, dude.</p>
<p>She'll tell a couple jokes, and then we'll, like, fake laugh and stuff, you know?</p>
<p>And tomorrow we can shit on her.</p>
<p>And she'll fight back and be happy again.</p>
<p>Say something!</p>
<p>(listlessly): I decided to stop showering.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Too much, Frank, too much.</p>
<p>That's...</p>
<p>There was no joke told.</p>
<p>I just figured, "What's the point?</p>
<p>I'm just a filthy person."</p>
<p>I passed out at the park the other day, and a couple of kids wrote, "Wash me" in the filth on my vagina.</p>
<p>(laughter) Gross.</p>
<p>That was kind of funny, man.</p>
<p>That was kind of funny.</p>
<p>It was so gross.</p>
<p>It was gross.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that guy over there laughed.</p>
<p>I guess, joke's on me.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>There's the catchphrase.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah! Ca...</p>
<p>Yeah, that's like a ca...</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go select some men for Dee.</p>
<p>This is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Um, I stepped in front of a bus, but it missed me.</p>
<p>I can't even get a bus to hit on me.</p>
<p>(laughter) People are laughing!</p>
<p>We love it!</p>
<p>For real.</p>
<p>For real?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Knock, knock, knock.</p>
<p>Can we say hi? There she is!</p>
<p>Comedy star.</p>
<p>Dee <em>so</em> funny.</p>
<p>Really funny.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, so funny.</p>
<p>Great! It was absolutely great!</p>
<p>You did the bus joke, and it was like...</p>
<p>They loved the catchphrase.</p>
<p>They loved the catchphrase!</p>
<p>And think about this, Dee.</p>
<p>You didn't even gag once.</p>
<p>Not one dry heave, nothing.</p>
<p>I guess I did pretty good.</p>
<p>Yeah, great!</p>
<p>"Pretty good," she said!</p>
<p>Dee, it was one of those shows where you're, like, "Whoa!"</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>And then your brain goes (makes explosion sound).</p>
<p>All right, guys, will you stop, okay?</p>
<p>You're not helping.</p>
<p>Please, go get a drink, all right?</p>
<p>Give us a second.</p>
<p>I need to talk to Dee.</p>
<p>We tried.</p>
<p>Yeah, you tried.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>All right, listen, listen to me.</p>
<p>Your set tonight was terrible.</p>
<p>It was atrocious.</p>
<p>Every single thing that came out of your mouth was trash.</p>
<p>It was filth. It was disgusting.</p>
<p>That's what really happened, okay?</p>
<p>I want to be very clear about this.</p>
<p>Now, listen, I brought some men for you to look at, all right?</p>
<p>I've got some selections.</p>
<p>Now, they're not great.</p>
<p>They're not, they're not anybody to brag about, but, uh, you know, they're men.</p>
<p>And they're probably willing to spend their life with you, so...</p>
<p>Uh, hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>My name's Snyder, and I'm a talent scout.</p>
<p>And I just caught your last set.</p>
<p>You were hilarious.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to give you my card.</p>
<p>Give me a call.</p>
<p>No, she will not be calling you, sir, okay?</p>
<p>Please do not encourage her.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>You're-you're interrupting my work, all right?</p>
<p>You're not on my list of chosen men.</p>
<p>Why would you be?</p>
<p>What are you...?</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Come on, Dee.</p>
<p>That guy clearly just lurks around these places pretending to be a talent scout so he can hit on women.</p>
<p>Now look-look at my selects, all right?</p>
<p>Look at these guys, huh?</p>
<p>(Dee gasps) Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>This one's just, like, one big chin.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't have a lot to work with.</p>
<p>You know, here we are, and look at you.</p>
<p>I mean, for Christ's sakes, look.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Look, I want this to work, I really do.</p>
<p>So I know I can do better, all right?</p>
<p>Can you do better, all right?</p>
<p>I'm gonna be at your house tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Have some new candidates for you to look at, all right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is gonna work.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is not gonna work.</p>
<p>Let's get you cleaned up, all right?</p>
<p>God, everything you did tonight was so gross.</p>
<p>Dee, open up! Open!</p>
<p>You're locking your door all of sudden?</p>
<p>What is that? Come on.</p>
<p>You care all of a sudden?</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>Hey, let me in.</p>
<p>I got selections for you.</p>
<p>Now's not a good time.</p>
<p>I'm right in the middle of something.</p>
<p>They're good selections.</p>
<p>Hey, it's the time I said, so it's the time it'll be.</p>
<p>Now let me in. I got selects.</p>
<p>I don't care about your selects.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Are you hiding something?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is someone in there?</p>
<p>No, no. Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Let me in or I'll barge in.</p>
<p>Hey, everything all right over there, Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's fine.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Dee, oh... Oh!</p>
<p>Snyder?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>He's clearly using you.</p>
<p>Or you're using him to further your nonexistent career.</p>
<p>I am not using him.</p>
<p>Oh, you're not using him?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Oh, good, good, good, good.</p>
<p>So, you like him?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Find him attractive?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Describe the ways in which you find him attractive.</p>
<p>(Dee scoffs)</p>
<p>He's got... he's got all of his skin, still.</p>
<p>Well, I would hope so.</p>
<p>And that he has plenty of... teeth to get...</p>
<p>But not all of them?</p>
<p>No, not all of them.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Dee, why can't you see that this is the same pattern that you always fall into?</p>
<p>Some guy uses you or you use him.</p>
<p>And then you know what happens?</p>
<p>It's use, use, use, fail, fail, fail, and then it's suicide.</p>
<p>You think you can't go any lower?</p>
<p>Because you can.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, he got me another gig for tonight, boner.</p>
<p>What do you think of about that?</p>
<p>(making goofy noises)</p>
<p>What-what is that?</p>
<p>What are you... what are you doing?</p>
<p>Sound effects.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn, Dee.</p>
<p>You have no idea what's funny.</p>
<p>Don't do sound effects.</p>
<p>(Dee making goofy noises)</p>
<p>Don't do... don't... wh-what...</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey! Oh!</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis, oh, check this place out.</p>
<p>This is legit.</p>
<p>Dude, dude, Dee's opening for Landslide.</p>
<p>That guy's, like, the real deal.</p>
<p>I've never heard of him.</p>
<p>Mostly diarrhea jokes.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's the diarrhea guy, but it look-looks like this comedy stuff's paying off for her.</p>
<p>Yeah, well...</p>
<p>Hey, you don't get a gig like this by accident.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, don't get too excited, all right?</p>
<p>She got the gig 'cause she's banging some creep.</p>
<p>It's not gonna go well.</p>
<p>Who's the nerd?</p>
<p>Who, this guy? This is Walt.</p>
<p>Yeah, guy's got no self-esteem, just like Dee, so they're perfect for each other.</p>
<p>So after she bombs tonight, I'll put them together, thereby controlling the situation, and her, as I always have and I always will.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Uh... Walt, just Walt-Walt's the plan.</p>
<p>I'm Walt.</p>
<p>Yeah, shut up, Walt.</p>
<p>They know who you are.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Sweet Dee Reynolds!</p>
<p>(crowd cheering) Sweet Dee!</p>
<p>(breathing into microphone)</p>
<p>Sweet Dee, joke's on you!</p>
<p>(laughter) She's got fans now?</p>
<p>Christ, come on.</p>
<p>So I finally broke down and I took a shower the other day.</p>
<p>The stink flipped around and now my soap smells like dirty vag.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>She said "vagina."</p>
<p>A woman said "vagina."</p>
<p>That's what makes it funny!</p>
<p>Tasteless.</p>
<p>(robot voice): vagina, vagina.</p>
<p>vagina, vagina.</p>
<p>(laughter) (making fart noises)</p>
<p>And the sound effects out of absolutely nowhere, no setup.</p>
<p>But it's funny!</p>
<p>It's not funny, it's not funny.</p>
<p>It's funny, Dennis.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Will you stop laughing, Walt?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, this is the worst.</p>
<p>People will laugh at absolutely anything.</p>
<p>This is comedy?</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>So, men are just so hard.</p>
<p>Tell you what, they all walk out on me.</p>
<p>Every one of them.</p>
<p>I can't even keep crabs in this vagina.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>They're all like, "Clickety clackety, clickety clackety, clickety clackety clack.</p>
<p>I got to get out of here!"</p>
<p>(robot voice): Evacuate vagina.</p>
<p>"Clickety clackety, clickety..."</p>
<p>(making machine gun noises)</p>
<p>The crabs have machine guns.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>All right, well, that's it for me tonight.</p>
<p>I'd like to say it was fun, but I've had a better time ripping out my own pubes.</p>
<p>Shellac, shellac, rip!</p>
<p>(yelling wildly)</p>
<p>Ping, ping, ping, ow!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Okay, you guys, well, I'm Sweet Dee, and the joke's on me!</p>
<p>(crowd cheering)</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>This is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Let's give it up for Landslide!</p>
<p>(crowd cheering)</p>
<p>Well, that was a funny white bitch, wasn't it? (laughs)</p>
<p>Skinny though.</p>
<p>I took bigger dumps than her.</p>
<p>(making fart noises) (laughter)</p>
<p>It's a landslide!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I bet his diarrhea is nasty!</p>
<p>Nasty!</p>
<p>Oh, butts, vaginas and diarrhea, great.</p>
<p>This is what the world's come to.</p>
<p>(Charlie laughing) Hey, hey.</p>
<p>You're on the list?</p>
<p>The list? I'm-I'm Sweet Dee's brother, so we're good.</p>
<p>Can't let you back there unless you're on the list.</p>
<p>We got to be on that list.</p>
<p>This is fantastic.</p>
<p>I'm not on a list for a place that I don't want to be.</p>
<p>You know how that feels?</p>
<p>Hey, Dee? Dee?</p>
<p>Uh, don't play this game, Dee.</p>
<p>I-I... We're five feet away from you, I know you hear...</p>
<p>Deandra.</p>
<p>Dee. Dee.</p>
<p>Da.</p>
<p>Da.</p>
<p>Da.</p>
<p>Dah.</p>
<p>Dah.</p>
<p>Dah. Dah.</p>
<p>Dee. Dee.</p>
<p>(all chanting different pronunciations of "Dee")</p>

<p>Yes, yes, yes. What? What?</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Hi. What?</p>
<p>Hey, Dee, can we come back there with you?</p>
<p>Yeah, hey, we're, like, you're biggest fans, like, great show, like, good job, like, shut up, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We're gonna start a fan club.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, stop kissing her ass.</p>
<p>Dee, enough of this, okay?</p>
<p>Step over the rope and come meet Walt.</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>You three, you're in.</p>
<p>Dennis, you're out.</p>
<p>Go before she changes her mind, go.</p>
<p>Hey! Faced! Thanks, Dee.</p>
<p>Dee, who do you think you are?</p>
<p>What is the matter with you, Dennis?</p>
<p>You see them?</p>
<p>They're supporting me, okay?</p>
<p>Because they believe in me.</p>
<p>A fan club could really help further my career.</p>
<p>Career? Oh, wow, Dee.</p>
<p>See, you don't have a career.</p>
<p>All right? So I need you to stop all this right now.</p>
<p>It's gone too far.</p>
<p>Now, come meet Walt.</p>
<p>He is my select.</p>
<p>You know what I think this is about, Dennis?</p>
<p>I think you're jealous.</p>
<p>I don't think you want me to succeed.</p>
<p>Dee, let me be very clear about something.</p>
<p>You will never succeed.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Instead, you will fly too close to the sun, and you will choke and you will gag in a spectacular manner.</p>
<p>So, please, for the love of God, take Walt.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Walt.</p>
<p>She knows your goddamn name, Walt; I said it, like, a thousand times.</p>
<p>Look, you know what?</p>
<p>I don't want to be with Walt, okay?</p>
<p>And I don't want you to find me a man.</p>
<p>What I need you to do is stay out of my way, because Sweet Dee is gonna be a star.</p>

<p>So get another one.</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Michael Rotenberg.</p>
<p>I'm a talent manager from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I've heard a lot about you.</p>
<p>Oh, hi. Well...</p>
<p>I've got a proposition for you.</p>
<p>One of my bigger clients is supposed to do <em>Conan</em> tomorrow night, and something came up.</p>
<p>They need to fill the spot, and I brought your name up.</p>
<p>Are you interested?</p>
<p>Conan O...</p>
<p>Conan O'Brien?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would love to represent you, too; I think you're amazing.</p>
<p>I can fly you to L.A. tomorrow on my private jet, and we can go straight <em>Conan.</em></p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Uh, well, my goodness.</p>
<p>This is all... This is all...</p>
<p>This is all... (gags)</p>
<p>This is all... (gags)</p>
<p>Oh, boy, hold on.</p>
<p>Uh, you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It's just, uh, just had a little piece of sausage.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm sure you did.</p>
<p>Um, now, I'm not stepping on anyone's toes here, am I?</p>
<p>Do you already have representation?</p>
<p>Representation? No.</p>
<p>Hey, sweetheart, there you are.</p>
<p>Ew! Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Who the hell's that?</p>
<p>This is, uh, my new manager.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Sorry, Snyder, I don't need you anymore.</p>
<p>This guy's taking me to Hollywood on a private jet.</p>
<p>What? Hollywood!</p>
<p>Hollywood!</p>
<p>We're going to Hollywood!</p>
<p>No, no, no!</p>
<p><em>We're</em> not going anywhere.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room if you want to take your friends.</p>
<p>There's no room, okay?</p>
<p>I have no use for you guys anymore.</p>
<p>Hey, what do you say we go back to my hotel and have sex?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Screw you, guys.</p>
<p>What the hell, Dee?!</p>
<p>We made you!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, you made me?!</p>
<p>You made me?!</p>
<p>I made you!</p>
<p>Screw you guys, all right?</p>
<p>(making goofy noises) Oh.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You excited?</p>
<p>Am I excited?</p>
<p>Y... yes, I am.</p>
<p>Yes, I...</p>
<p>Dee, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I made a mistake.</p>
<p>All this time, I've been searching for the perfect guy to take you off of my hands forever, but... I realized something.</p>
<p>The perfect guy's been under my nose the entire time.</p>
<p>It's me, Dee.</p>
<p>I'm the perfect select.</p>
<p>I know, I've spent my entire life shitting all over your dreams, and not supporting you, but I was wrong, Dee.</p>
<p>I see that now.</p>
<p>You can succeed.</p>
<p>You <em>will</em> be a star.</p>
<p>You have to take me.</p>
<p>I'm your twin brother.</p>
<p>I love you, Dee.</p>
<p>Dennis... suck my dick.</p>
<p>(Dennis grunting) Wait.</p>
<p>Dee!</p>
<p>No, wait, Dee, wait!</p>
<p>Don't do this, Dee!</p>
<p>Dee, wait!</p>
<p>Dee, stop!</p>
<p>Don't fly away now!</p>
<p>Dee, wait!</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>So when we get to L.A., you're going straight into the limo and right to <em>Conan.</em></p>
<p>I'm gonna whisk you right backstage, and we go straight on.</p>
<p>This is the big-time, Dee.</p>
<p>You're not in Philadelphia anymore, okay?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>People are gonna be screaming your name, there's gonna be paparazzi.</p>
<p>Papa... whew.</p>
<p>(gagging): Paparazzi, huh?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I tipped them off.</p>
<p>It's all about image.</p>
