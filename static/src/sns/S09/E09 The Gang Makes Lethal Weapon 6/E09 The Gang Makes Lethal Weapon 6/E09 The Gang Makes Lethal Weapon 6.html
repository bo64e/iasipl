<p>We just need a little money to finish it.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, we had a little bit of a falling out with our financier.</p>
<p>He's also playing Chief Lazarus.</p>

<p>But, to be fair, I don't have a problem, as much, with the act itself as I do with the man who's performing it.</p>
<p>Don't get into that.</p>

<p>Let her know. I think she...</p>
<p>Look, I just, I think that no one wants to see Frank smashing genitalia with a woman, but if it were me doing it, you know, imagine that.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be nice?</p>
<p>Imagine all the positions that I could get into.</p>
<p>You know, reverse pile driver, seated scissors, wheelbarrow, reverse cowgirl.</p>

<p>God, the bank didn't get it either.</p>
<p>Why make anything, you know? For the money, for the glory, for the fame. Absolutely.</p>
<p>All-- the whole thing. Yeah, and-and clearly the movie's pretty kick-ass right up until we get to the special effects snafu. Our ex-backer liked to cut corners, but we feel like, with your technical expertise, being from a dot-com company and all, and your money, we could really make a kick-ass movie. Yeah, now, the next scene is, um, the next scene is bad. The next scene is a little bit of a disaster. It's got some problems, too, but then, once we get past that, it's pretty good, but let me set this up for you so you're not totally confused.</p>
<p>Somebody released some kind of a biting bug, the likes of which I've never contended with. Frank and I got them from China, and they just went crazy in the bar and bit us up like...</p>
<p>What do you mean you "got them from China"?</p>
<p>You ordered them? Don't worry about where we got them or why we were getting them.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Jesus Christ. We just released them, there was an issue... All right, so you're gonna enjoy this part. Go ahead and push play.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, keep it going.</p>

<p>It's great that you're a cop again, Rog.</p>
<p>We'll n-need it. Well, I had to come back because they killed my baby girl as you was getting married to her. Yeah.</p>
<p>Looks like I'm not the only cop with a death wish now.</p>
<p>Ha! Chief, I think I found some clues. What the hell does those things have to do with Chief Lazarus?</p>
<p>Well, I've got a hunch. Chief, I've got a hunch.</p>
<p>See, feathers were usually used in Indian resurrection burials, which could only mean one thing. Damn!</p>
<p>Well... That Lazarus is back from the dead. Damn!</p>
<p>You think?</em></p>
<p>So he's probably planning an elaborate rain dance to drench L.A. so bad that it ends up in the ocean.</p>
<p>Making his Indian reservation the only thing left standing and very valuable beachfront property.</p>
<p>That's could be the only answer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is important...</p>

<p>No, <em>you</em> can't follow what's going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, you can.</p>
