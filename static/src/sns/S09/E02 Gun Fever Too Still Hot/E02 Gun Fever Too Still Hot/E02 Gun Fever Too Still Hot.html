<p>Good morning, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>With us today is Frank Reynolds, local business owner and a man with a harrowing story.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p>A few days ago, three thugs tried to mug me.</p>
<p>And I want to be very clear about something.</p>
<p>Um, Mr...</p>
<p>These pieces of garbage, they don't know who the hell they're dealing with.</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds, excuse me.</p>
<p>Do you think maybe you could eat that sandwich later?</p>
<p>I'm starving.</p>
<p>You don't have nothing to eat in this show.</p>
<p>Let's get back to your story.</p>
<p>Right, so these punks... </p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>...I don't know if they wanted money or they wanted something more sexual.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But it's a lucky thing I had my pieces.</p>
<p>Your-your pieces?</p>
<p>My guns.</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started blasting.</p>
<p>Bah! Bah!</p>
<p>Now, I don't see so good, so I missed, then they ran away, I ran after them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Bang! Tried to shoot them in the back, but I don't run so good either.</p>
<p>Anyway, you guys all think I'm a hero, and I'll accept that responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, weren't you concerned though that an innocent bystander may have...</p>
<p>Look, crime in this city is out of control.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Thank God I went down to Gunther's Guns and picked up a spare.</p>
<p>I don't think one would've done it. I'm gonna go out and buy some more. Okay.</p>
<p>And I think you should, too.</p>
<p>Don't be a victim.</p>
<p>It's time to fight back.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Completely insane.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, it's driving me nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: The whole gun thing, it just makes me really hot.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it's a hot issue and I'm getting hot about it, too.</p>
<p>This is good, we're all hot at the same time.</p>
<p>We should do something about...</p>
<p>I mean, our schools aren't safe.</p>
<p>There are people out on the streets with assault rifles?</p>
<p>We're living in constant fear!</p>
<p>Aw, guys, we got to get more guns on the streets!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>We got to get more guns onto the streets.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got to get guns in the right hands.</p>
<p>I mean, we're just not safe.</p>
<p>That's what you guys are hot about?</p>
<p>Yeah, didn't you hear what Frank said?</p>
<p>Yeah, what are you hot about?</p>
<p>There are too many guns on the streets as it is.</p>
<p>Guns off the streets is what we need.</p>
<p>It's way too easy for anybody to just walk into a store and get a gun.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>It getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>The government's trying to take our guns away.</p>
<p>It's way harder than you think, dude.</p>
<p>Guys, we're hot about the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Shoot.</p>
<p>Which is a bummer, 'cause I thought we were on the same page for once.</p>
<p>(clicking tongue)</p>
<p>Still very hot though.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, I'm even hotter if I'm being honest.</p>
<p>Still hot.</p>
<p>Good call on these outfits, dude.</p>
<p>It's the only call.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, you need a guy in a school that even from a mile away, the school shooter sees that guy and says, "Uh-uh."</p>
<p>"I ain't messing with that dude."</p>
<p>"I'm not messing with that dude.</p>
<p>I'm not going near that school."</p>
<p><strong>Macintyre</strong>: Uh, gentlemen, I understand that you would like to...</p>
<p>You... How-how did you find me?</p>
<p>Oh, shit, I know this dude.</p>
<p>Who-Who's this?</p>
<p>This guy was the principal at the high school where I was doing the janitor thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so why are you at a middle school now?</p>
<p>Well, I was... I was transferred.</p>
<p>See, I have tenure, so they couldn't actually fire me, which was, of course, their first choice, thanks to you.</p>
<p>Well, let's not throw barbs at each other.</p>
<p>Look, we're actually here for a good cause.</p>
<p>We want to protect this school.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, we want to be the armed security guards.</p>
<p>Yeah, I brought a piece.</p>
<p>We're good.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, no, no!</p>
<p>Calm yourself.</p>
<p>No, you got to put... no...</p>
<p>It's not currently loaded.</p>
<p>That's not the...</p>
<p>Just put it away.</p>
<p>I hear you, buddy.</p>
<p>I would not want to be around this guy with a gun either.</p>
<p>He has got a hair trigger.</p>
<p>I mean, one little move and he'll just start blasting.</p>
<p>Uh, bullshit.</p>
<p>Look, the point is he shouldn't have a gun in a school in the first place anyway.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Guns just do not belong in schools.</p>
<p>No, they do not.</p>
<p>That is why I brought along a saber.</p>
<p>Aw, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Which is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life, because how are you gonna stop a gunman with that?</p>
<p>Bro...</p>
<p>He's gonna get you from a distance.</p>
<p>If I come at you, I'll get to you faster.</p>
<p>We have been arguing about this all day.</p>
<p>Because it's insanity.</p>
<p>Ooh, maybe you can be the judge.</p>
<p>I don't want... What?</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I'm gonna holster my weapon, he'll holster his weapon.</p>
<p>No, we, no...</p>
<p>I'll do, like, a one, two, three count, you tell us who goes faster.</p>
<p>Please don't do this in here.</p>
<p>Look, dude, this is the only way to tell, okay?</p>
<p>And then we can protect your school, but we got to go one step at a time, all right?</p>
<p>I mean, for God's sake...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Look out!</p>
<p>(gun clicking empty)</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>I guess I do have a hair trigger, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Look at all these maniacs.</p>
<p>Goddamn bloodthirsty freaks walking in off the street.</p>
<p>So easy for anybody to just waltz in and buy a gun.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Let's buy assault rifles and just prove to Mac and Charlie how easy it is.</p>
<p>Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna.</p>
<p>That's what we'll do.</p>
<p>Hi, how are you, sir?</p>
<p>Howdy, I'm Gunther.</p>
<p>What can I do for you?</p>
<p>Oh, Gunther himself, purveyor of destruction.</p>
<p>I would like to buy a man destroyer from you, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, nice to meet you, Gunther.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe you could recommend something that could blow a hole through an elephant, you know.</p>
<p>'Cause I need that for my home protection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess you're looking at an AR-15.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's great.</p>
<p>Now, theoretically, Gunther, would I be able to slaughter a roomful of innocent people with that weapon?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Brother, that'd be on you.</p>
<p>That would be on me, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah, that wouldn't be on you at all.</p>
<p>But here you go.</p>
<p>But here you go.</p>
<p>But here you go.</p>
<p>Okay, great, we'll take one of those, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got it.</p>
<p>How much would that be?</p>
<p>Uh, that's $1,500.</p>
<p>Woof!</p>
<p>$1,500 for the privilege, okay.</p>
<p>Hey, what is your, uh, what is your return policy there?</p>
<p>30 days, no charge.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Ooh, 30 days, sounds fair.</p>
<p>My goodness, Dennis, this feels good.</p>
<p>Feels good in my hands.</p>
<p>(both making machine gun noises)</p>
<p>Oh, good my kids are safe.</p>
<p>I saved everyone!</p>
<p>Yeah, my yard's protected.</p>
<p>So, of course, it feels good, you know?</p>
<p>But that only proves our point even more.</p>
<p>We'll take two of these, Gunther.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I'll need your licenses for the background checks.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can drive, you can kill!</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Oh, Christ, look at this.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, I love this guy.</p>
<p>...become a bit of a local lightning rod in these gun debates here.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Gun sales have skyrocketed.</p>
<p>We're running out of guns, and we have to manufacture more guns; supply is not meeting the demand.</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Jack</strong>: Can we... can we cut?</p>
<p>Will my hands look this small on the screen?</p>
<p>Uh, we're live, sir.</p>
<p>I thought the camera would add ten pounds to my hands, and I don't like the way they look.</p>
<p>Your hands look fine.</p>
<p>Put them down.</p>
<p>This is Jack Kelly.</p>
<p>He's my attorney.</p>
<p>He specializes in Constitutional Law.</p>
<p>Our rights are being infringed upon.</p>
<p>And people like my client won't take it anymore.</p>
<p>The Constitution guarantees our Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>And these liberals like Al Gore, they're trying to take that away from us with this global warming bullshit.</p>
<p>So, you see the two issues as related somehow?</p>
<p>Damn right.</p>
<p>The government of today has no right telling us how to live our lives, because the government of 200 years ago already did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>They also protected us from tyranny against the seizure of tasteful, artistic photographs of beautiful bodies.</p>
<p>Not now, Jack.</p>
<p>That same government wants to come into our home, tell us what is and what is not art?</p>
<p>That's not right!</p>
<p>Okay, well, I'm gonna try and, uh, keep things on track here, so... Yeah.</p>
<p>Get out and get those guns before they run out, and the government changes the laws.</p>
<p>(cheering, applause)</p>
<p>All right! Yeah!</p>
<p>These idiots are buying this?</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>That was fast.</p>
<p>You've been denied.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's ludicrous.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It says here you have an extensive history of felonious behavior.</p>
<p>Oh, there have been incidents, sure, yeah, a few minor indiscretions, but, you know, I-I'm simply a person of interest in most of those cases, all right?</p>
<p>Being wanted and being "wanted for questioning" are very, very, very different things, Gunther.</p>
<p>And you've been institutionalized.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>She... she... yeah.</p>
<p>What... I mean, one time, for a short period of time.</p>
<p>That-that was against my will.</p>
<p>That doesn't even really count.</p>
<p>That's the only time it counts, Dee.</p>
<p>Okay, look, it was, like, a teeny thing that happened with a college roommate.</p>
<p>It was really no big deal.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Says here you burned her.</p>
<p>I burned her, yeah.</p>
<p>I burned her.</p>
<p>But... (laughs)</p>
<p>She was so annoying.</p>
<p>I mean, it...</p>
<p>She deserved it, okay?</p>
<p>She was wearing my stuff, and she was copying me, and...</p>
<p>You were copying her.</p>
<p>I was copying her, she was copying me...</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry, but I can't sell you the guns.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Oh, well, look at you.</p>
<p>Oh, Gunther the morality king.</p>
<p>"Hi, I'm Gunther, I've never lit anybody on fire before."</p>
<p>You know, you light one bitch on fire, and everybody freaks out!</p>
<p>Oh, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>It was one time and one thing, I just...</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right, relax, relax.</p>
<p>(Dee yells wildly)</p>
<p>Okay, take it easy.</p>
<p>Look, there are other ways to buy guns where people don't go snooping around in your past.</p>
<p>Listen, pal... you just made my list.</p>
<p>Your list?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a...</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Whatever, let's just go.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>How is that tasteless?</p>
<p>It's art.</p>
<p>Get that out.</p>
<p>Get that out.</p>
<p>You can't even see the child...</p>
<p>We'll be right back.</p>
<p>Weather, traffic and a trip to the zoo, coming right up.</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna demonstrate to you how to thwart an attack.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Now, pretend that this dummy is a school shooter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I want you to stand back, 'cause I don't want you to get hurt.</p>
<p>Before he can draw his weapon...</p>
<p>Hie-aught!</p>
<p>Hup, hut, hut!</p>
<p>Hie!</p>
<p>How awesome was that?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that's-that's pretty awesome, but I feel like he would've shot you from a mile away.</p>
<p>No, no, he wouldn't, because you saw how I was zigzagging like this and making sounds?</p>
<p>It was distracting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but did you ever see <em>Indiana Jones,</em> where the guy does the whole sword thing and then he just shoots him dead?</p>
<p>Are you asking me if I've seen <em>Indiana Jones? Are you seriously asking me?</em></p>
<p>I've seen that movie...</p>
<p>That <em>is</em> my...</p>
<p>You're not understanding.</p>
<p>Do you remember it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But if I were to come at you, it's all about how I...</p>
<p>(gun clicking empty)</p>
<p>Okay, in that circumstance, maybe you got there a little bit faster.</p>
<p>I got you.</p>
<p>But if I...!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I got you again.</p>
<p>But I... What if I zigzag like this?</p>
<p>It's so easy to get you.</p>
<p>And that's... that's not necessarily...</p>
<p>I don't think that that's...</p>
<p>Hold-hold on a second.</p>
<p>Look at this kid.</p>
<p>Ooh, he's wearing all black, he's walking by himself.</p>
<p>What do you think he's doing on that phone?</p>
<p>Oh, I'll tell you exactly what he's doing.</p>
<p>He's playing one of those games where you shoot everyone.</p>
<p>I'm gonna profile this guy really quick.</p>
<p>Excuse us.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, kid, kid, kid.</p>
<p>Stop, stop.</p>
<p>Son, son, I'm sorry, hold up, hold up. (laughs)</p>
<p>What are you doing on the phone there?</p>
<p>None of your business.</p>
<p>(Charlie whistles)</p>
<p>A sass-mouth, huh?</p>
<p>That's a red flag.</p>
<p>Son, you were asked a question by an adult, okay?</p>
<p>You've been asked a question, all right?</p>
<p>We're trying to ensafen your school here, okay?</p>
<p>And you're acting like a punk?</p>
<p>Let me see the phone.</p>
<p>I want to see.</p>
<p>Oh! He's killing zombies!</p>
<p>I'm taking this.</p>
<p>What the hell, man?</p>
<p>Hey, kid, you're getting off easy!</p>
<p>Now get to school.</p>
<p>Go to school.</p>
<p>Just know we're watching you.</p>
<p>Go to class.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>This is a red flag.</p>
<p>These are the kids that are the threats to society, the ones playing the violent video games, man.</p>
<p>I play violent video games.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I also play violent video games.</p>
<p>I watch violent movies.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, violent movies are the best movies.</p>
<p>And I don't want to kill people.</p>
<p>No, I mean...</p>
<p>All right, this...</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not really the best way to tell, you know, who's gonna be a threat or who's not gonna...</p>
<p>What is going on out here?</p>
<p>Nothing, thanks to us, bro.</p>
<p>Well, are-are you stealing kids' cell phones?</p>
<p>Stealing, sir? No.</p>
<p>I've been confiscating them as potential evidence.</p>
<p>Are you aware that you're holding children up with a gun and-and a sword?</p>
<p>You just... you need to stay off of school property.</p>
<p>Sir, we are not on the school property, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're outside of the fence by, like...</p>
<p>We're on the sidewalk, see?</p>
<p>You need to stay 1,000 yards away from school property.</p>
<p>I mean, we're trying to keep the school safe!</p>
<p>I know, well, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we would all feel a lot safer if you were further away.</p>
<p>All right, I'm taking this guy out.</p>
<p>Hey, whoa, settle!</p>
<p>Settle, settle, settle!</p>
<p>Settle. Settle down.</p>
<p>Would you please stop pointing that gun at me?</p>
<p>(gun clicks empty)</p>
<p>The school is safe, thanks to us.</p>
<p>Here's the damn phone.</p>
<p>Well... please, just... if you could just get away from the school.</p>
<p>Get away from the children.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Just-just stay away from the children.</p>
<p>Have a good day, sir.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Have a good day.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>We're leaving!</p>
<p>We're leaving, we're leaving.</p>
<p>We're leaving.</p>
<p>You know, Charlie, if we can't be in the school zone, maybe we need to train somebody who can be.</p>
<p>You know, someone you'd never suspect could stop a shooter.</p>
<p>I got an idea.</p>
<p>And here we are, Dee, at a gun show, huh?</p>
<p>Lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Is that a bazooka?</p>
<p>Insanely dangerous, this place is.</p>
<p>It's crazy.</p>
<p>Oh, look at this guy right here.</p>
<p>He'll probably sell us a gun.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>Um, I would like to buy a gun from you.</p>
<p>Something that is unnecessarily powerful, something you would never need in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Yeah, ooh, ooh, but you know what you shouldn't do though, is look into our very sketchy pasts.</p>
<p>No. (laughs)</p>
<p>Uh, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>We all got a sketchy past.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>Oh, genuine creep. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Hey, sir, could you please sell us this AR-15?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, despite, you know, who or what we plan to obliterate with it.</p>
<p>And don't ask questions, okay?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>'Cause we just want to prove to our friends how easy it is to buy a high-capacity rifle.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right, man, great.</p>
<p>Hey, so give this guy his 1,500 bucks, and we'll just saunter right out of here with a weapon of mass extinction.</p>
<p>Three grand.</p>
<p>What? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's $3,000.</p>
<p>No, not for this.</p>
<p>No, for this, for this.</p>
<p>No, no. No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>At Gunther's it's $1,500.</p>
<p>(laughs): Oh, this ain't Gunther's.</p>
<p>This a price gouge?</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>That's illegal.</p>
<p>Oh, you see, I'm a private seller.</p>
<p>That means I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Fine. That's fine.</p>
<p>We'll buy it, and we'll return it.</p>
<p>All sales are final.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>I'll show you what's final, you redneck son of a bitch!</p>
<p>I will burn you alive like the last bitch who crossed me!</p>
<p>Okay, all right, all right, Dee.</p>
<p>That's not getting us anywhere.</p>
<p>Okay, she's hot.</p>
<p>I went... I went hot real fast; it just happened.</p>
<p>Well, our whole crew's been hot lately.</p>
<p>We're trying to cool down, but you're not making it any easier.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>All right, listen, I want this gun, pal.</p>
<p>Okay, I want it, because it's easy to buy a gun.</p>
<p>And I need to prove that to some people, so give me the gun at a fair price, and do it now.</p>
<p>$4,000.</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>Four thou...? $4,000?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>(cocks gun)</p>
<p>How about I just take it, huh?</p>
<p>'Cause I'm a maniac with a gun, and there's nothing you can do about it. (chuckles)</p>
<p>(guns cocking)</p>
<p>(Dee gasps)</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Oops. (laughs)</p>
<p>Putting the gun down now.</p>
<p>Okay, this is just a... just an exercise, okay, to prove how unsafe it is... for everyone to have guns, okay?</p>
<p>But I see now that I was the maniac with the gun.</p>
<p>And you all made it safer... in here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Our bad, our bad for this experiment.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>I know you may not see yourself as a solution to a national problem.</p>
<p>You might not think you have the ability, but, uh, believe me, you were... you were carefully selected.</p>
<p>And with a little hard work and a whole lot of training, we can help you keep your school safe.</p>
<p>Are there any questions?</p>
<p>Yo, can I get some beer?</p>
<p>No beer.</p>
<p>No. We said it, like, a million times.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, how many times do we have to be through this?</p>
<p>No beer, okay?</p>
<p>All right, you know, you can't drink beer and be effective.</p>
<p>But you guys had, like, five.</p>
<p>Don't count beers, Carlos.</p>
<p>Not cool.</p>
<p>Yeah. And by the way, Carlos, I've had six.</p>
<p>And I've had seven.</p>
<p>So don't be a rat, okay?</p>
<p>And if you are gonna be a rat, get it right.</p>
<p>No more questions.</p>
<p>In fact, no more questions.</p>
<p>You guys are the ones that asked for the questions.</p>
<p>Shut up, Carlos!</p>
<p>Carlos, shut up!</p>
<p>The time for questions is over.</p>
<p>It's now time for learning.</p>
<p>Okay? You're-you're impeding on your own safety.</p>
<p>Okay, now my friend and I have been arguing all day about the efficacy of swords versus guns.</p>
<p>Okay? So we met in the middle.</p>
<p>Now if you look under your seat, you'll see that each of you has been provided a weapon that you could easily find in your own classroom.</p>
<p>Some of you may have compasses, others, sharp pencils.</p>
<p>Okay, there are forks in the cafeteria, there's piano wire from the music room.</p>
<p>You need to learn how to make every single item in your school a potentially life-threatening weapon.</p>
<p>Look at the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>That person wants to take you out.</p>
<p>Guys, safety is the name of the game.</p>
<p>It's all about safety.</p>
<p>Let's take it slow.</p>
<p>We're gonna take this in a safe and orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Are you ready to begin?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And, guys, let's have a little fun.</p>
<p>(kids yelling)</p>
<p>Shut it, shut it, shut it!</p>
<p>Those-those kids are maniacs!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I think they're all in gangs or something!</p>
<p>There's a lot of score settling going on in there!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, dude, we created a <em>HungerGames-type</em> scenario in there.</p>
<p>Imagine if they had guns!</p>
<p>Oh, it'd be a disaster!</p>
<p>An absolute disaster!</p>
<p>These kids are all too violent.</p>
<p>It's, like, ingrained in them or something.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude, we've been singing the wrong tune.</p>
<p>Society is getting more savage.</p>
<p>We need to get the weapons <em>out</em> of their hands!</p>
<p>Maybe we should call the cops, the only people who should have guns!</p>
<p>They got to come in here, they got to calm this down!</p>
<p>(door banging)</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, shit, Charlie, I got to admit something, dude.</p>
<p>I'm bleeding pretty bad.</p>
<p>One of the kids got you?</p>
<p>I nicked myself back in the principal's office just trying to upholster my weapon.</p>
<p>Jesus, man.</p>
<p>I didn't want to say anything 'cause it was a little bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>(door bangs)</p>
<p>All right, can I go to the hospital?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's go.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>FRANK (over radio): First they disarm us, then they oppress us.</p>
<p>So I want you to get every gun you can buy and bring it to 17th and JFK, and we're gonna march on City Hall.</p>
<p>And bring whatever guests you want, regardless of age or whatever restriction the government puts on our expression of beauty.</p>
<p>Just get the guns and bring them down to City Hall.</p>
<p>Well, you better believe I'll be there.</p>
<p>I know you'll be there.</p>
<p>Bring your kid.</p>
<p>You have kids?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, of course.</p>
<p>Bring them.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>He's really going off the deep end, Dee.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I hate to admit it, Dennis, but he's got a point, you know.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like it's all that easy to buy an assault rifle.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Don't you start with that shit, Dee.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It is incredibly easy to buy assault rifle, and I'm gonna prove to you how easy it is right now.</p>
<p>Okay, here comes our guy.</p>
<p>Mm, mm. No.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Uh, you got my money?</p>
<p>(scoffs) You got my people-killer?</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Oh, ho, ho, ho.</p>
<p>That's the stuff, baby.</p>
<p>Now, I got $1,500, which is the fair asking price.</p>
<p>I hope that's okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. Give it to me.</p>
<p>All right. There you go.</p>
<p>All right, now, I'm not really totally comfortable rolling the window down.</p>
<p>I'm sure you understand why, so I'm just gonna pop the trunk and you can, uh, you can throw it in there, all right?</p>
<p>Back there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In the trunk?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, I got you.</p>
<p>You see how easy that is, Dee?</p>
<p>You just give a man $1,500 and he gives you an assault rifle.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>What? Where's he going?</p>
<p>Well, he appears to be sauntering off.</p>
<p>Well, don't do... No.</p>
<p>Well, sir, I gave you the $1,500.</p>
<p>Don't saunter away. I'm try...</p>
<p>That's not fair!</p>
<p>No, it's not fair!</p>
<p>You stop right now!</p>
<p>Listen, you stop in your tracks!</p>
<p>Uh, Dennis, go stop him.</p>
<p>Denni... Go stop...?</p>
<p>The man has an assault rifle!</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do?!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>I can't buy one!</p>
<p>The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, which we can't get!</p>
<p>Goddamn son of a bitch Frank, you were right!</p>
<p>Frank was right!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Where's Frank? We're hot.</p>
<p>We're coming in super hot!</p>
<p>Where is Frank?!</p>
<p>Oh, you guys hot?</p>
<p>You guys are still hot?</p>
<p>The whole thing's hot, man!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I'm burning up right now!</p>
<p>It's a crazy situation!</p>
<p>We're on your side now!</p>
<p>We got to get these guns off the streets!</p>
<p>Boo-yah!</p>
<p>Wait, what? No, no.</p>
<p>Off the streets?</p>
<p>What are you, crazy?</p>
<p>We need the guns on the streets!</p>
<p>Everyone needs to have guns!</p>
<p>We need to flood the streets with guns!</p>
<p>To stay safe.</p>
<p>Aw, shit.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, uh...</p>
<p>You know, I think we crossed right past each other like ships in the night, man.</p>
<p>We flip-flopped.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause we're on the opposite side now.</p>
<p>That side makes no more sense to me.</p>
<p>If we could've just met up, like, two hours ago...</p>
<p>Oh, oh, there's Frank.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank!</p>
<p>Frank, is that a box of guns?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Guns? No.</p>
<p>Water filters.</p>
<p>Water filters?</p>
<p>All right, guys, load 'em in.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, why do you have a truck full of water filters?</p>
<p>Uh, you know what, I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Let's get down to that rally, man.</p>
<p>Rally?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, the freedom rally.</p>
<p>The one you organized.</p>
<p>Ooh, shit, I'm not gonna go down there.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a bunch of nuts with guns.</p>
<p>Too dangerous.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>I thought you were into guns.</p>
<p>You know, why have you been on TV talking about all that shit?</p>
<p>I bought a stake in Gunther's Guns.</p>
<p>I got everybody angry and scared.</p>
<p>They bought the guns, I made a fortune.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. This is crazy.</p>
<p>So you don't give a shit about the gun issue at all?</p>
<p>Uh, uh...</p>
<p>I mean, what the hell?</p>
<p>You're like the NRA.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit like the NRA.</p>
<p>Little tiny bit.</p>
<p>But I-I think of myself more like Al Gore.</p>
<p>You know, he got everybody worked up over global warming.</p>
<p>Then he made millions.</p>
<p>Huh?!</p>
<p>Yeah. Everybody does it.</p>
<p>Liberals, conservatives, doesn't matter.</p>
<p>This is America: you're either a duper or a dupee.</p>
<p>I'm a duper.</p>
<p>You guys are the dupees.</p>
<p>I got to go.</p>
<p>Where you going now?</p>
<p>With us now is local community activist, Frank Reynolds, with a terrifying statistic.</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Yes. Thank you, Chet.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Do you know that 90% of your water is 100% toxins?</p>
<p>Who knows what the other 10% is?</p>
<p>It's probably far worse, I would imagine.</p>
<p>It's really worse.</p>
<p>I have a water filter for you that you need to put in every single home.</p>
<p>It will protect you and your entire family.</p>
<p>You can even give that water to your babies.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, babies, look out, because this next segment is just for you.</p>
<p>Don't turn that channel.</p>
<p>Your life may depend upon it.</p>
<p>Got to give it to him.</p>
<p>He is good.</p>
<p>That son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Goddamn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(Dee sighs)</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna get one of those water filters.</p>
<p>I do kind of want one, right?</p>
<p>For safety, for safety.</p>
<p>I mean, he does make some good points.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The water's toxic.</p>
<p>I mean, it is. Yeah.</p>
