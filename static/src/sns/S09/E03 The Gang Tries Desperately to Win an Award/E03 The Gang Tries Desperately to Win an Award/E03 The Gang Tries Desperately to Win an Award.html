<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Just use 'em, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I'm not going to wear gloves while I work!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, it makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: It absolutely makes sense-- you're a janitor who snakes toilets with his bare hands.</p>
<p>So my hands get a little dirty from time to time.</p>
<p>I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.</p>
<p>It's not for you!</p>
<p>It's for us!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Use gloves!</p>
<p>Use gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, look at this.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>The Restaurant and Bar Association's Best Bar Award is coming up.</p>
<p>We could get nominated.</p>
<p>Frank, we never get nominated for awards, okay?</p>
<p>And we don't give a shit because they're stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don't care about that kind of stuff, all right?</p>
<p>Look, am I curious as to why we never get nominated?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Do I care? Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>No, I don't care about it, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, all right, it is a little <em>odd</em> we've never been nominated.</p>
<p>Yes, it's odd.</p>
<p>At some point it becomes a little aggressive.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>We don't deserve it?</p>
<p>We're not cool enough?</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Whoa, okay, Frank.</p>
<p>Now, if... if I do something, you better believe it's cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I'm gonna put my name on something, it's gonna be award-worthy, you know.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that other people are doing what we're doing better.</p>
<p>I mean, it's serving up drinks.</p>
<p>It's just upsetting.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm getting upset.</p>
<p>If-if you want to get a nomination, you got to play the game.</p>
<p>Nah, I don't want to play a game to get an award.</p>
<p>That feels lame.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> lame.</p>
<p>Oh, is that your ass? (smooches)</p>
<p>Oh, closer to the hole, sir?</p>
<p>(smooches, groans)</p>
<p>You know what's lame?</p>
<p>Being around this long and never getting an award. Makes you look like a bunch of assholes. Hmm.</p>
<p>You're really, like, driving this home, and it's upsetting, because, like, now I'm getting the neck thing.</p>
<p>I feel... I feel...</p>
<p>I'm getting upset.</p>
<p>Yeah, your neck's going nuts?</p>
<p>Yeah! You're getting that?</p>
<p><em>They're</em> making me feel like an asshole.</p>
<p>They <em>are</em> making us feel like assholes.</p>
<p>All right, you know what, we'll play the game, I'll kiss ass.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's play the game.</p>
<p>I'm okay with it, because who cares?</p>
<p>All right, fine, let's play the game.</p>
<p>But I want to be very clear about something.</p>
<p>(scoffs) This literally means nothing to me.</p>
<p>This office sucks.</p>
<p>It smells bad and it's stuffy in here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's the Restaurant and Bar Association, it's a stuffy organization.</p>
<p>They're not in touch with the young people like us.</p>
<p>Some old boner gives me attitude, I'm gonna spit in his face.</p>
<p>He starts giving me shit, I'll spit at him.</p>
<p>We should all spit.</p>
<p>Look, we're not spitting, all right?</p>
<p>Just keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking.</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p>Frank Reynolds, Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>These are my associates.</p>
<p>Stand up, show him some respect.</p>
<p>I stand for no one.</p>
<p>Please, it's not necessary.</p>
<p>Have a seat.</p>
<p>You heard the man-- sit down.</p>
<p>Well, now I feel like standing.</p>
<p>But I don't want to stand through an entire meeting 'cause I don't know how long it's gonna last, so I'll sit down.</p>
<p>It's <em>my</em> choice.</p>
<p>With much dignity and grace, we've come to talk to you about the Best Bar Award.</p>
<p>Now, in the past, our group has not... <em>paid</em> you any attention, but now we are prepared to <em>pay...</em> you what you deserve... in attention, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>Ponder lettuce and shrimp.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>He's inviting you out to lunch, Bozo-- you gonna go or not, yes or no?</p>
<p>Actually, it's 3:30 in the afternoon-- I've already eaten.</p>
<p>This dickhead doesn't want a second lun... He's being offered lettuce and shrimp, he doesn't want to eat lunch.</p>
<p>You eat once a day?</p>
<p>(mock sobbing): Hey, everybody, I had food.</p>
<p>All right, you know what, I am out of here.</p>
<p>I don't need this limpdick telling me whether my bar's cool, okay? (hawking)</p>
<p>No, no, no! No spitting.</p>
<p>(others hawking)</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Look, how much is it gonna cost us to get on the ballot?</p>
<p>Ten dollars.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>The entry fee is ten dollars.</p>
<p>All you have to do is fill out the-the paperwork.</p>
<p>Why have we never received this form?</p>
<p>Well, we've-we've actually s-sent you the form many times in the past, and as I recall, it always comes back covered in fecal matter, urine, and... racial slurs. Oh.</p>
<p>That's a joke.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, that's just, like, all in good fun, man.</p>
<p>That's just our sense of humor-- you'll get us.</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Let bygones be bygones.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>We're here now to play the game.</p>
<p>Yes. Playing the game.</p>
<p>I assume you take cash.</p>
<p>Oh! So sorry.</p>
<p>That wasn't meant for you, that was actually meant for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was meant for him.</p>
<p>We thought maybe you would think that was funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, if it exploded in your face, but I can tell by the look on your face that you don't think that's funny.</p>
<p>That's not your style.</p>
<p>That's a shame.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's sort of our sense of humor.</p>
<p>Guys, he's not gonna get us.</p>
<p>I think we got to get out of here, right?</p>
<p>All right, guy.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>What'd I say, idiots?</p>
<p>You want to get nominated, you gotta play the game.</p>
<p>We are playing the game, Frank.</p>
<p>Nah, you're not playing...</p>
<p>We're just not vibing with that guy, he's a stiff.</p>
<p>We were vibrating, but maybe at a different frequency than that guy.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Frank is right.</p>
<p>No, Frank is right, though.</p>
<p>We're too fringe.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it's given us a lot of street cred, but I think we've alienated a lot of people in this town.</p>
<p>Yeah, you-you want to win awards, you gotta campaign for it.</p>
<p>It's an industry award.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Like, we know we're cool and our customers know we're cool, but the industry doesn't get it yet.</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>Can you guys actually drop me off back at the bar? I'm gonna go work on the Best Song. What Best Song?</p>
<p>The Best Song Award.</p>
<p>There is no Best Song Award.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Well, that's all the more reason to do a Best Song, right?</p>
<p>We'll be the only bar who did it, and that's a good chance we'll cover all the bases.</p>
<p>(Frank sighs) I tell you what: let's drop him off either way. Okay.</p>
<p>That sounds good.</p>
<p>Good idea, Charlie.</p>
<p>Good idea, come on.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>I can't believe that this place won Best Bar.</p>
<p>I mean, who comes to this place?</p>
<p>A shitload of people.</p>
<p>Sudz is a super-popular place.</p>
<p>I can't believe how bright it is in here.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>Yeah. And what's with all the loud, fake colors?</p>
<p>I mean, where's the subtlety?</p>
<p>All right, let's go grab a drink.</p>
<p>We'll suss out the competition.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go find a manager, introduce myself, give him this swag bag.</p>
<p>What's in that bag?</p>
<p>Ah, it's just this stuff I had our names printed on.</p>
<p>I got a bottle opener, a keychain, egg. Why would you give him an egg?</p>
<p>It's like a paperweight.</p>
<p>Trust me, Deandra, people eat this shit up.</p>
<p>Look, you gotta play the game.</p>
<p>I know how to do it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Let's get a drink.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>How you doing?</p>
<p>My name is Greg; I'll be your bartender tonight.</p>
<p>You ever been to Sudz before?</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p>Don't think so, pal.</p>
<p>Okay, well, welcome, then.</p>
<p>For our first-timers, I like to recommend our blended signature cocktail, The Blue Hole.</p>
<p>It's served with three straws in a fishbowl.</p>
<p>It's pretty darn good.</p>
<p>Some people say it's better than an orgasm. (laughs)</p>
<p>Not that he's ever had one.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Okay, Maxwell, remind me to find a new best friend.</p>
<p>Aw! Ee-aw!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Ugh. Two margaritas for table six, Greg.</p>
<p>Hey, Amanda, what's wrong?</p>
<p>Let me guess. Your boyfriend canceled on you again.</p>
<p>Conference got extended.</p>
<p>What can I say?</p>
<p>He loves his work.</p>
<p>Well, I think he should spend a little less time on his work and a little more time on you. ALL: Aw...</p>
<p>Thanks. You're so sweet. Hmm.</p>
<p>What in the hell is happening?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>What are they doing?</p>
<p>Okay, sorry about that.</p>
<p>So, one Blue Hole?</p>
<p>Uh, well, let's see.</p>
<p>There's three of us, so, three drinks. Yeah, well, they're generally shared, 'cause they're pretty big.</p>
<p>Said three, dick bag.</p>
<p>Get three!</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I don't care for that guy.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Too soft. I want a little edge in my bartender.</p>
<p>You know, this is Philadelphia.</p>
<p>What's with the, uh...?</p>
<p>What's with the black friend that no one is acknowledging?</p>
<p>Is black...?</p>
<p>I feel like it's weird if you don't talk about that, you know?</p>
<p>It's strange to have one black friend and not be constantly talking about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, shine a light on it, make sure everybody sees and knows, like, "I have a black friend," and that's a thing.</p>
<p>'Cause it's weird that a black person is friends with white people.</p>
<p>Hmm. I don't... think it is.</p>
<p>It's not that weird, but it's that... but it's a thing.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>Here you guys go.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>Oh, drink up!</p>
<p>(whooping)</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>That's a Sudz alert.</p>
<p>When we ring that bell, everybody's got to drink, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>I don't need a bell telling me when to drink.</p>
<p>I'll drink when I'm goddamn good and thirsty.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I know when to take a drink. Screw their stupid bell, you know?</p>
<p>I wish I had drank when everybody else drank, though, 'cause it seemed like fun.</p>
<p>Well, now I feel left out.</p>
<p>Can we drink now?</p>
<p>Let's drink now.</p>
<p>Together?</p>
<p>'Cause I-I...</p>
<p>Now I'm angry.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>What are you doing in my office?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>You snuck up on me.</p>
<p>Frank Reynolds, owner of Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd come by and say hello, pay my respects.</p>
<p>Also, I got you a little goody bag here.</p>
<p>Some trinkets, knickknacks that you might enjoy.</p>
<p>There's a broken egg in here.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>That wasn't the hardboiled one.</p>
<p>Hey, you want me to cook that up for you?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Ooh! Goddamn.</p>
<p>That went down easy.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Guys, I'm starting to like this place.</p>
<p>It's growing on me, too.</p>
<p>I-I like the chemistry that the staff has.</p>
<p>Oh, did you guys see that charged moment between Greg and Amanda? Yes.</p>
<p>Boy, I tell you.</p>
<p>She's got a boyfriend, but I think that she and Greg should end up together. Ooh, ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>I'd like to come back next week to see if they do.</p>
<p>Yeah. Me, too. You know? I mean, she is cute, she is just super cute, right?</p>
<p>She's so cute.</p>
<p>She's cute. She is very cute.</p>
<p>She's not funny, though, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, but, no, but she doesn't need to be funny because she's cute, she's loveable, everybody likes her, and then, if she can tell a joke, yeah, hey, it's just a bonus, you know?</p>
<p>Let's get out of this dump.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, this place is not a dump, Frank.</p>
<p>It's pretty great.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, Greg, can you get this man a Blue Hole?</p>
<p>You got to try this thing.</p>
<p>I got news for you.</p>
<p>Our secret's out, and it stinks.</p>
<p>This manager's been to Paddy's, and he said it's nothing but a bunch of people yelling over each other. Well... So what? That's what we do.</p>
<p>We yell at each other, and if people want to tune in and listen, then they're welcome to.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that's off-putting to the customer.</p>
<p>I mean, Greg would never yell at Amanda.</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what we got to do.</p>
<p>We got to up our game.</p>
<p>We should host an industry night.</p>
<p>Invite all the people who vote who's in the industry to come to our bar, and we'll show 'em what we're made of.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I'd like to tweak a little bit of who we are and what we're made of, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Soften the edges a little bit.</p>
<p>All right, we'll tweak it a little bit, we'll show these bastards who's award-worthy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Oh-ho! Drink! Drink!</p>
<p>Okay, guys, if we're gonna show these industry folks tonight that we're likeable, we need to have some funny banter like Greg and Maxwell have.</p>
<p>Yeah. Don't worry.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be zinging one-liners all night long.</p>
<p>Uh, actually, Dee, you won't be zinging anything around, because men are intimidated by funny women, all right?</p>
<p>So, what we need you to be is just pretty and benign.</p>
<p>But we are gonna do a will-they- or-won't-they thing between you and Mac. Dee and I don't want to be together. No.</p>
<p>But the customers want you to be together.</p>
<p>That's fun for them.</p>
<p>Why would it be fun for them to watch two people not want to be together?</p>
<p>Well, no. You <em>do</em> want to be together, okay?</p>
<p>The customers have to think that you think that you don't want to be together, but you do, deep down, want to be together.</p>
<p>The problem is, right now, I'm getting that you guys don't want to be together. I need you to want to be together. Ugh.</p>
<p>Question.</p>
<p>Yes, you're wondering how we're gonna make Dee attractive enough to where you'll want to be with her.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, see, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna shellac her with makeup, and I'm gonna blast her with light to soften up all those features.</p>
<p>I am into that, yes.</p>
<p>Yes. Okay, great.</p>
<p>So, guys, I got us banter cards.</p>
<p>Mac, you're gonna welcome the customer in, and then I'm gonna execute with a quip.</p>
<p>Let's give it a shot.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm Mac.</p>
<p>Welcome to Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>I would like to recommend to first-timers our signature blended drink, Caribbean Paradise.</p>
<p>People say it's better than an orgasm."</p>
<p>Not that he's ever had one.</p>
<p>I've had orgasm!</p>
<p>I've had tons of orgasm!</p>
<p>I've had one with your mom, dude! I will strangle you, I'll stick my goddamn thumb through your eye!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, relax, relax.</p>
<p>Sit down. What are you doing?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You came at me, and I gave it back to you hard, 'cause...</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I'm getting that.</p>
<p>Look, I'm just doing the thing.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>See, what you just did-- that's how we normally talk.</p>
<p>That's very aggressive.</p>
<p>I came at you hard.</p>
<p>You came at me real hard, and people aren't comfortable with that sort of behavior.</p>
<p>That's why we're trying something different here, okay?</p>
<p>Guys, memorize these lines, okay?</p>
<p>We need to seem like it's coming off the cuff.</p>
<p>Right. Plus, she didn't even feel a thing.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's the punch line to Mac bang-banging our mom.</p>
<p>She didn't, she didn't even notice.</p>
<p>Oh, Dee, Jesus Christ, your timing is so bad.</p>
<p>He just said it.</p>
<p>There's a timing concern.</p>
<p>Look, stop.</p>
<p>Don't do the jokes, okay?</p>
<p>Let's settle into our new roles here, okay?</p>
<p>Little bit of role-play.</p>
<p>Change of plans.</p>
<p>Change of plans.</p>
<p>We got to go darker with Industry Night, edgier.</p>
<p>No, Frank, don't derail us.</p>
<p>We're doing bright lights, bright colors, and funny banter.</p>
<p>That's what wins.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Artemis and I went to a burlesque bar last night.</p>
<p>Eh, there were women stripping, but it was classy.</p>
<p>It was dimly lit.</p>
<p>They were serving martinis, period costumes.</p>
<p>There weren't a lot of people in there, but this bar has won a shitload of awards.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that our location is the problem?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>That could be it, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no, see, there was that bar that just opened last year right down the street, and they've already won a ton of awards. Oh, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Is it us?</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Us?</p>
<p>No, no, no, it can't be us.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>I highly doubt it's us.</p>
<p>It's everybody else.</p>
<p>It's their problem, not us.</p>
<p>We don't have the...</p>
<p>Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>I got it! I got it!</p>
<p>Got what?</p>
<p>The Best Song.</p>
<p>I wrote the Best Song.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<p>Get with the program.</p>
<p>Yes, Charlie, please.</p>
<p>We're all clamoring to hear.</p>

<p>My goodness!</p>
<p>Hey, hey!</p>
<p>Well, well, well.</p>
<p>My goodness.</p>
<p>You guys really like it?</p>
<p>You're not just bullshitting me?</p>
<p>It was pretty great!</p>
<p>I tried to go right down the middle, you know, of Middle America, Randy Newman...</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't catch any rape references, nothing about spiders, nothing about ghouls.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Why would there be rape? You're always talking about rape and spiders.</p>
<p>You guys misinterpret it, but...</p>
<p>Charlie, that was great.</p>
<p>It was really great.</p>
<p>You really knocked it out of the park. Let's go down to the basement and get some lemons for the party.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, sure, okay.</p>
<p>I'm glad you like the song, man.</p>
<p>(Frank chuckling)</p>
<p>(lock clicks)</p>
<p>Are you locking me in here?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, we just couldn't have him do that song.</p>
<p>Doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous. All right, let's put on a good show.</p>
<p>All right, people are starting to arrive.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Okay, so when a customer comes up to you, remember, keep it light.</p>
<p>Light.</p>
<p>Keep it playful.</p>
<p>Playful.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Y'all ain't got to worry about me.</p>
<p>'Cause I'm gonna be chatting these fools up like a mug.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks, Z.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm a little worried about him.</p>
<p>We should have gotten a less intense black guy for diversity, but we don't have any in our roster.</p>
<p>But maybe we could find another one, throw him into the mix?</p>
<p>You know, to counter Z's vibe?</p>
<p>You got to be really careful about the ratio.</p>
<p>We get too many black guys, people think it's a black bar.</p>
<p>That will not help us.</p>
<p>Black bars don't win awards.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but they don't.</p>
<p>Loving these lights, you guys.</p>
<p>I am glowing like an angel over here.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Hi, can I get a drink?</p>
<p>Hey, I'm Mac.</p>
<p>Welcome to Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>I like to recommend to our first timers our signature cocktail--</p>
<p>Caribbean Paradise. Some people say it's better than busting a nut. Excuse me?</p>
<p>Busting a nut.</p>
<p>It's like, uh, you know, blowing your load.</p>
<p>He said it was a funny joke.</p>
<p>Well, no... hold on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's like coming all over you.</p>
<p>It's light, it's playful.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, no, I think what my friend is trying to refer to is an orgasm, which is light and playful, but he overstepped himself and got a little bit too specific.</p>
<p>Sorry, we jizz in the drink and that's what makes it light.</p>
<p>No, no, nobody's jizzing on anything.</p>
<p>Well, where do I jizz?</p>
<p>You don't jizz.</p>
<p>How can, how can I orgasm if I don't jizz?</p>
<p>No, ma'am, I think what...</p>
<p>Just tell me where I jizz so I can give this lady her drink.</p>
<p>Ma'am, what would you like to drink?</p>
<p>And we won't jizz on anything.</p>
<p>Not like Mac's ever had an orgasm.</p>
<p>Holy shit, you're late.</p>
<p>She was late.</p>
<p>Go back in your light.</p>
<p>We're all set up back there.</p>
<p>Deandra, grab a couple of bottles of champagne, let's go.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>N-N-No, I got it, I got it.</p>
<p>Dee, stay in your light.</p>
<p>Come with me, come here.</p>
<p>All right, listen, listen, listen.</p>

<p>Hmm. This guy doesn't know what he's got.</p>
<p>He's really ugly, too.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, are you talking to me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I said her boyfriend's ugly.</p>
<p>Pay attention, bozo.</p>
<p>Okay, he's not ugly, all right?</p>
<p>That wouldn't make any sense.</p>
<p>That's-that... He's not ugly.</p>
<p>Dude's a total tool, too.</p>
<p>It's... (stammers)</p>
<p>You know what he's not?</p>
<p>He's not covered in stupid tattoos and he doesn't have a cigarette for a mother...</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Don't talk shit about my mom!</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>

<p>This isn't will they or won't they?</p>
<p>This is I know they won't and I know I don't want them to.</p>
<p>(Charlie grunting)</p>
<p>Excuse me, there's a guy crawling out of your floor.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, that-that's okay.</p>

<p>Are you high?</p>
<p>You put, you put me in the basement with spray cans.</p>

<p>Do me a favor, go back in the basement, okay?</p>
<p>Get higher if you want.</p>
<p>Just go back in.</p>
<p>Don't sit down there.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't... Goddamn it.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do? Oh, well, it looks like Z brought friends. Yo, yo, yo.</p>

<p>Dennis, the ratio is off!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, the burlesque, remember?</p>
<p>Burlesque, yes, yes, yes.</p>
