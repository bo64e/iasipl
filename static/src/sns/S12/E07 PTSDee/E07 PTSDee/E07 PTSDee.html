<p>shit! Frank! There's somebody here.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Is anybody here?</p>
<p>Speak up... we will shoot.</p>
<p>Wait, hold your fire, Frank! It's just a kid.</p>
<p>Hey, boy.</p>
<p>Is that water for us?</p>
<p>(gunfire)</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank, you just killed a kid!</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>(exclaims)</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I'm gonna give him CPR.</p>
<p>Now, is he blowing someone? What is happening?</p>
<p>Yeah, looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Jesus Christ, Frank, he was just trying to give us water, man!</p>
<p>Forget it, he's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You can't go around killing kids!</p>
<p>Think about his mom and his dad.</p>
<p>How long they been playing this for?</p>
<p>Oh, dude... three straight days.</p>
<p>They've been playing this for three days?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, have they slept?</p>
<p>No. No, they've just been wandering around the bar, blowing kids, doing whatever they're doing, you know?</p>
<p>Frank, behind you!</p>
<p>Is this where we're headed?</p>
<p>I mean, as a world? Know what I mean... as a society?</p>
<p>Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?</p>
<p>Oh, what is this, now?</p>
<p>What? Who?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What do you want to tell us? Just tell us.</p>
<p>Oh, I just totally hooked up with this super hot stripper soldier last night. He's swinging by.</p>
<p>Oh, you're dating a stripper.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Wow, gross.</p>
<p>Gross? If you guys started dating a stripper you'd be bragging about it for days. I meet myself a Channing Tatum and suddenly it's gross?</p>
<p>A what... a charming taint man?</p>
<p>What words is she trying to say?</p>
<p>Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>He's an actor.</p>
<p>What do I know him in?</p>
<p>Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>G.I... Oh, G.I. Joe's the shit.</p>
<p>G.I. Joe. - Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.</p>
<p>All right, you know what, whatever. It doesn't matter. Anyway, we had this really amazing connection and the sex was so meaningful, both of us wept tears of joy.</p>
<p>Makes me want to throw up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just what happened.</p>
<p>You know what I think is happening right now? I think the guy's coming by because you stole his watch.</p>
<p>Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something so he'd come over and you-you...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right? Just to get him to talk to you again.</p>

<p>Thank<em> you</em> for last night.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's like, we were having sex and the whole time Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, "What's become of me?"</p>
<p>You know, all I do is I strip all night, I play video games all day, I have meaningless sex with strangers.</p>
<p>My own daughter won't even talk to me, you know? So I was like... "Damn."</p>
<p>And I realized I hit rock bottom.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And that's why I was crying.</p>
<p>Oh. Right, yeah.</p>

<p>No. Because it... Why would it be?</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on, man, that's not trauma. That's not real trauma.</p>
<p>Nah. It's not even that bad.</p>
<p>I mean, if... if anything, that's insulting to people who have experienced real trauma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it is. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, like you, for instance.</p>
<p>Uh, me?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. Sure, man.</p>
<p>I mean, you grew up fatherless.</p>
<p>You were raised by a woman who was basically a prostitute.</p>

<p>Yeah, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Got some daddy issues there.</p>

<p>You'll do what?</p>
<p>I'll strip. Yeah.</p>
<p>Huh. I didn't realize you were talking about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>You know, if this Mike fella wants to walk away from an amazing stripping career, hey, I'll take up that mantle.</p>
<p>You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not thinking of it before.</p>
<p>You know? It just makes sense.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, man. I can't do it without you.</p>
<p>I need you to get my back.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I-I-I... no, I just literally need you to have a look at my back, you know, make sure there's no moles or, like, unsightly hairs, bumps, zits, you know, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mac.</p>
<p>Slow down. What are you saying?</p>
<p>I got to quit the game, dude. I can't do this anymore.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Don't quit just yet.</p>
<p>Look, have a drink and calm down.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>(sighs) I'll calm down. I'll-I'll drink some whiskey or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, stuff it down with brown.</p>
<p>That's the best way to deal with things.</p>
<p>(quietly): Okay.</p>
<p>Kid's a mess.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie, we're 30 minutes late, man.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry I cut your back so many times, man.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>I was nervous, dude.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I've never, like, cut such a muscular back.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, dude, your back looks great, man.</p>
<p>I'm working hard, dude.</p>
<p>Dude, you're putting the work in, and it's showing, man.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right, right, right.</p>
<p>But just let's not talk about it in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Don't bring it up.</p>
<p>Can you walk me through what your guy is again?</p>
<p>Okay, so here's the deal, man.</p>
<p>Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else?</p>
<p>Jugglers.</p>
<p>Jug...?</p>
<p>Dudes who can, like, juggle things.</p>
<p>I know what a juggler is.</p>
<p>You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, they don't want to have sex with a juggler.</p>
<p>They want to have sex with their dads.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is weird, so I'm a dad.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay, cool. Oh, and I'm your boy.</p>
<p>All right, that works.</p>
<p>Well, no. What? Why would you be my boy?</p>
<p>Oh, you said I was gonna be your boy 'cause I have daddy trauma, and then, I didn't realize I was gonna be your boy in there, but that works great.</p>
<p>No, that doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>How would you be my s...?</p>
<p>I'm their dad. How could I also be your dad?</p>
<p>We can't all be related. Christ, Charlie, you're not making any sense, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you could have a lot of kids, I guess.</p>
<p>I got to say, though, I'm looking inside there, and this isn't making sense to me.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all older women. Might be a little bit hard for me to pull off the dad thing at all.</p>
<p>That's not a good play.</p>
<p>You know, I'm getting a bad feeling about this, man.</p>
<p>Hey, man, do you think maybe that's 'cause of your librarian trauma?</p>
<p>You're talking about Ms. Klinsky?</p>
<p>Yeah, she was an older woman, and...</p>
<p>What? No. There was...</p>
<p>Let's not talk... Can we stop talking about trauma and-and-and cuts on the... on peoples' backs?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And let's... It's not sexy, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, let's go.</p>
<p>All right, man.</p>
<p>Are you the stripper?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.</p>
<p>Uh... (laughs)</p>
<p>What, are you 40?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Fine. You guys'll do, I guess.</p>
<p>Y-You guys? No. Sorry. I'm just the boy.</p>
<p>The what? - Just...</p>
<p>Sorry. I'm-I'm<em> his</em> boy.</p>
<p>Well, you're not my boy. He's not... (chuckles)</p>
<p>Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches, or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?</p>
<p>Daddy?</p>
<p>Just don't call me Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Yeah, my generation...</em> we drank our problems away.</p>
<p>But since you softies like to talk about everything, I figured this was a good thing to do.</p>
<p>A PTSD support group, Frank?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Maybe you'll get some help, we can finish the damn game.</p>
<p>What's up, dicks?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Well, because I am a rock and not a rock bottom, I decided to reach out to Mike and see if I could get him some help with, uh, some of these issues he's been having.</p>
<p>I'm confused. Is this a PTSD meeting for vets?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, yeah. You're a military guy, right?</p>
<p>No. It was just my stripper character.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, I just figured you based your characters off past experiences.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna pass myself off as a vet, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't feel good about this. Maybe...</p>
<p>Well, then just don't talk.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>You don't have to talk. Just sit down.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started.</p>
<p>Probably not gonna call on you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Okay, right off the bat, I can see we got some newcomers here today. You guys want to introduce yourselves?</p>
<p>Ugh. Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm Frank.</p>
<p>I've been around the block, seen some action.</p>
<p>I was in 'Nam for a while.</p>
<p>Private sector mostly.</p>
<p>I did shoot a couple of dinks who tried to jack some sneakers off the factory floor.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>I don't feel nothing about it.</p>
<p>I'm just here to support my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Dee (clears throat)</strong>: Uh...</p>
<p>Hello. I'm Dee. I'm a rock.</p>
<p>I'm here with this guy.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a mix-up about his military credentials, but, uh... whatever.</p>
<p>Now he's under the delusion that he's hit rock bottom, you know, and I just don't see how that's possibly true, so, we're gonna straighten that up while we're sitting here today, you know.</p>
<p>Mac's being a pussy!</p>
<p>He doesn't want to fight anymore!</p>
<p>I'm not being a pussy.</p>
<p>I just don't want to kill women and children.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: How do I get him to stop thinking of them as real people?</p>
<p>Mike's embarrassed about his dancing, and I just... I don't get that.</p>
<p>I don't... How is that rock bottom behavior?</p>
<p>You know? Think of Channing Tatum.</p>
<p>Can you please explain Channing Tatum to him?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I follow...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. He's G.I. Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mac can't sleep at night.</p>
<p>He's having erotic nightmares and shit.</p>
<p>He doesn't know what's real anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Mike's embarrassed about his video game-playing, which makes no sense to me, 'cause you know what? Video games are hard.</p>
<p>You ever play <em>Fallujah?</em></p>
<p>Beat it five times.</p>
<p>You want to play with me?</p>
<p>I'm actually trying to get away from that.</p>
<p>Well, what if he paid you?</p>
<p>Ten bucks an hour.</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Wow. Really?</p>
<p>Well, will you look at that?</p>
<p>Now we're getting somewhere, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That couldn't have happened without your rock, could it?</p>
<p>Wait a second, Frank. What about me?</p>
<p>You're out. Dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>Doesn't matter. We're done with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>(gasps) Dad?!</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I broke out of jail and came straight to see you.</p>
<p>Because you love me?</p>
<p>'Cause I'm gonna kill you, son.</p>
<p>(muffled yelling): Oh. Oh, no!</p>
<p>(loudly gasping for air)</p>
<p>What...? What-What's happening?</p>
<p>When did I get here? How long have I been asleep?</p>
<p>You got here, like, five minutes ago.</p>
<p>You've been asleep for 35 seconds.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm-I'm losing my mind.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm actually going insane.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You know, we're all having a little bit of a hard time right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we got to fight fire with fire, and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.</p>
<p>We're gonna win this war.</p>
<p>What war?</p>
<p>The war on women!</p>
<p>Women, man!</p>
<p>There's a war on women? Can I get in on that?</p>

<p>I think we were just suffering from sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Well, where's Mike? I want to finish the game.</p>
<p>Oh, we finished the game. Yeah, like, right after you passed out, Mike and I just got in there.</p>
<p>Dude, it was awesome.</p>
<p>Do you want to do it again?</p>
<p>No, I don't want to play anymore.</p>
<p>Well, where's Mike? I'll do it with him.</p>
<p>He's out, too. Yeah, he's doing some weird stripping thing with Dennis and Charlie.</p>
<p>I only woke you up 'cause I figured you'd want to see it.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(indistinct chatter)</p>
<p>I really appreciate you getting me this gig. I mean, truthfully, I don't think I was ready to give this lifestyle up.</p>
<p>Of course not. Why would you? You're really good at dancing. That's nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Listen, you like video games? I got you paid for it.</p>
<p>You're a great stripper? I got you this gig.</p>
<p>And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm gonna reunite you with your daughter.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Look, I really appreciate everything you've done.</p>
<p>It really, really means a lot to me.</p>
<p>Eh, well, you just needed your rock.</p>
<p>Fire it up.</p>
<p>Smell good? Everything poppin'?</p>
<p>All right. No, feels good.</p>
<p>Look good?</p>
<p>I don't know. What do you think?</p>
<p>You like how it smells?</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>And you can't see any of the blood.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>It's all patched up good.</p>
<p>What do you think about my prop, hmm?</p>
<p>That's really cool.</p>
<p>A little kid licking that up there.</p>
<p>Wait, what-what am I smelling?</p>
<p>Cheese.</p>
<p>Is that made of cheese?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then I painted the rest with, like, magic marker and stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, Christ. Why did you make a cheese lollipop? It stinks.</p>
<p>For-for my nerves. Yeah.</p>
<p>That smells horrible.</p>
<p>Oh, God. There's nothing sexy about cheese. Put it away.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Ladies, are we ready to party tonight?</p>
<p>(whooping)</p>
<p>So am I.</p>

<p>All right.</p>
<p>We're gonna see some skin tonight. Yeah.</p>
<p>Scars and all.</p>
<p>This, actually, is a real scar, too.</p>
<p>And I got a good story behind that.</p>
<p>This is, uh... They took out the kidney, actually, from the fron... A Chinaman. And he did not know how to do it, I'll tell you that much.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Cricket was a bad idea, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. But we needed that, like, you know, McConaughey emcee-type.</p>
<p>Yeah. But looks like we got AIDS<em> Dallas Buyers Club</em> McConaughey, not<em> Magic Mike</em> McConaughey.</p>
<p>That is what he looks like.</p>
<p>It's a good crowd, though. It's a good crowd.</p>
<p>He's... Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, well...</p>
<p>That was the first time that I really thought, "Hey, I might actually, uh...</p>
<p>I might die, and... and no one's gonna remember."</p>
<p>All right! Hey!</p>
<p>Let's, uh, keep it movin'.</p>
