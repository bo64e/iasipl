<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>So Dennis hasn't even seen the apartment yet?</em></p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>No. No. Yeah, Dennis lost a bet, and I got to redesign</em> our old apartment. He is gonna flip!</p>
<p>Ooh. Nice.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>That's great. I'm just excited to have my old place back to myself.</p>
<p>And guys, after the grand opening, we finally get a chance to fire...</p>
<p>( <em>Dee gasps</em> )</p>
<p>...the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Nice, dude! You got a rocket!</p>
<p>It finally came in the mail, and now we have the perfect opportunity to celebrate with it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, that will be good.</p>
<p>Fire in the hole.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, listen, listen. There's a girl.</p>
<p>She's coming, okay? There's a girl... Mandy.</p>
<p>Okay, she's here to stay, all right?</p>
<p>And-and-and you guys have to take my lead because I'm-I'm another guy, so don't address me as me because I'm somebody else.</p>
<p>Are we us?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, of course you are.</p>
<p>I don't want to be me. Can I be someone else?</p>
<p>No. You have to be you, okay? All of you are yourselves, except for Dee.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Are you right-handed, or left-handed?</p>
<p>That won't come up.</p>
<p>Well, it could come up.</p>
<p>It won't!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Okay. I'm gonna go with left then.</p>
<p>I'll go with left.</p>
<p>Cool. Left.</p>
<p>Let's go with the hand that I am, for Christ's sakes.</p>
<p>Hey! Mandy. Hi.</p>
<p>Hey. Ooh.</p>
<p>Why'd you run up ahead of me there, Brian?</p>
<p>Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Oh, so that must make you Prudence then.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. Yes, it does.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>He is Prudence, and I'm Griffin.</p>
<p>No, he's Mac!</p>
<p>He's just Mac, so don't... Yeah.</p>
<p>And that's Charlie, and that's Frank.</p>
<p>And he's left-handed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I suppose I didn't know that about you.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, well, there was really no reason for it to come up.</p>
<p>Mama.</p>
<p>Uh, guys, this is, uh, Mandy.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>And this is, uh... this is little Brian Junior.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah. He's my son.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna go with left-handed.</p>
<p>Left-handed or right-handed, man?</p>
<p>What's going on here, dude?</p>
<p>All right, look, you guys remember when we did that Boggs thing.</p>
<p>We flew out to California? Well, if you recall, I actually got off in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Right? Being out of town, I thought, naturally, I'm gonna have a little bit of fun, you know, so, I picked up Mandy there at an Applebee's.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I was pretending to be an airline pilot who flies out of Philly named Brian LeFevre.</p>
<p>I went to an old character.</p>
<p>I needed a complete back story for the manipulation.</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, but wasn't Prudence Brian's wife?</p>
<p>Yes, but in this scenario, she's my sister.</p>
<p>See, I'm always tweaking things based on the situation.</p>
<p>And needless to say, it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>But, uh, five months later, she calls me up, tells me she's pregnant.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Christ, what am I gonna do here? And need I remind you, once she finds out that I'm not who I said I was, and that I don't have any money, she could come after the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p>She could be entitled to that?</p>
<p>Ah... shit.</p>
<p>All right, guys, guys, everybody just calm down, all right?</p>
<p>Maybe it's not about money for her. Look, as we all know, everything is about emotion with women.</p>
<p>Right, Dee?</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Whoa!</p>
<p>All right, Dee, relax.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, whoa.</p>
<p>Rrr.</p>
<p>We're trying to have a rational conversation, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're trying to help our friend here.</p>
<p>Look, I think the point is, maybe we got to close the emotion door for Mandy by telling her that you're gay.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, but I already had sex with her.</p>
<p>How am I gonna convince her I'm gay?</p>
<p>Just go with me here.</p>
<p>Brian's not above having a one-night stand with a woman, but he's got no room for her emotionally because he's in love with me.</p>
<p>With you?</p>
<p>Well, yes, the lover is me, of course.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Next plan.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That plan stinks, because it's always about money with women.</p>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, <em>Indecent Proposal.</em></p>
<p>You get a millionaire to bang her for a million bucks.</p>
<p>She takes the money and runs.</p>
<p>Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?</p>
<p>No way. It's too much money.</p>
<p>All right, next plan. Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I've got a great plan, but, uh, I'm thinking that this isn't my problem, and, also, you guys wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.</p>
<p>Good point. Charlie, plan.</p>
<p>I got it. If I just get the waitress pregnant, she's gonna be tied to me for life, so, I got to do that.</p>
<p>He's already on to another thing.</p>
<p>All right, Christ, uh, I got to do something here.</p>
<p>Fine. Mac, we'll go with your plan.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yes! Yes.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Is the apartment ready?</p>
<p>Yes. You are not gonna believe what I did to it.</p>
<p>Surprise!</p>
<p>Huh. It looks, uh...</p>
<p>Exactly the same.</p>
<p>I was able to track down versions of our old furniture, and even found replicas of all the knickknacks that burned in the fire.</p>
<p>It's bizarre.</p>
<p>Bizarre in a good way.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You don't like it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hey, so, I don't mean to interrupt here, fellas, but I'm a little bit confused.</p>
<p>You never told me you had a roommate.</p>
<p>It's time, Brian.</p>
<p>Here's where things get a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>Um... there's really no easy way to say this, but, um, Mac and I aren't just friends.</p>
<p>He's actually my, uh...</p>
<p>Lover.</p>
<p>Partner.</p>
<p>Yes, well, we do make love.</p>
<p>We don't actually make love...</p>
<p>He's the power bottom.</p>
<p>Now he generates a tremendous amount of power...</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I...</p>
<p>...from the bottom.</p>
<p>I don't. I don't, actually.</p>
<p>Don't sell yourself short. He does.</p>
<p>No, no. It's not that I...</p>
<p>It's just that we don't have sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, uh... I sleep with women, but I'm emotionally involved with Mac, which is why... and this is the hard part... I...</p>
<p>I don't really... I don't have room emotionally in my life for you.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh... Wow.</p>
<p>Well, I'm a little bit shocked here.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>But I guess the most important thing is for Brian, Jr. to have a relationship with his father.</p>
<p>And you know, Mac, you seem like a real stand-up fella, so, if you boys are open to it, the only thing I can think of better than Junior having one dad is, well, him having two.</p>
<p>Ee.</p>
<p>Yeah. No.</p>
<p>Wow. I wasn't expecting that.</p>
<p>We're the type of guys that, um...</p>
<p>Who would love this.</p>
<p>Oh! ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>knocking</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah. Coming.</p>
<p>Hey, come on in.</p>
<p>All right, Charlie, you got 15 minutes, and it's a dollar a minute starting... now.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. No, we're not doing this. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Uh, now hear me out. It's not about sex.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>It's about having a baby.</p>
<p>And I'm gone.</p>
<p>Uh, no, no, no, hang on.</p>
<p>Hang on, one... Just one second. Come on.</p>
<p>Look, I know you've always wanted a baby, right?</p>
<p>I see you. You poke around the preschools and the playgrounds, and you got that longing look in your eye.</p>
<p>Oh, God, that's so creepy.</p>
<p>Well, look, I can tell you this.</p>
<p>It...</p>
<p>It's not gonna happen for you.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Yeah, you ain't gonna have a baby. Check this out.</p>
<p>Your life has been on a slow, but steady decline for years.</p>
<p>You were a coffee shop waitress, right?</p>
<p>On-again, off-again troubles with alcohol.</p>
<p>Living in a women's shelter.</p>
<p>And finally, all women's Achilles' heel... time.</p>
<p>Okay. Are you done?</p>
<p>Because I feel like there's more.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm seeing, like, a whole...</p>
<p>Yeah, this is... I'm getting to the good part.</p>
<p>Look. Frank will provide for us.</p>
<p>Right? He's got tons of money.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You're never gonna have to work another day in your life. See? Zzz.</p>
<p>All the way to sitting on the beach in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Driving the lane to fame.</p>
<p>Okay, so... the point is this, life with Charlie and a baby...</p>
<p>...looking pretty good.</p>
<p>Did you really think that this was gonna work?</p>
<p>Did you really think that...</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>...you would just have me in here and you could just... hurl insults at me.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I've tried everything for years with you.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>And I just... at this point, I just don't know what else to say.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Stop saying things to me.</p>
<p>Don't you understand that this is never gonna happen, so let it go.</p>
<p>Look, w-why? You won't ever tell me why.</p>
<p>You just say no, and you won't give me a shot.</p>
<p>I don't understand what's so terrible about me.</p>
<p>What's so great about me, Charlie?</p>
<p>What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>Why are you so obsessed with me?</p>
<p>I mean, you said it yourself, I'm a mess.</p>
<p>So, why don't you just go find somebody better?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>'cause there is no one better.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Those jerks are finally gone.</p>
<p>Time to stretch out around here.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Heyo.</p>
<p>What's the haps, Dee?</p>
<p>What are you doing, Frank?</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie's doing a thing at the apartment tonight, so I'm gonna crash here.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>No, get a hotel.</p>
<p>You know what, do you mind if I take the bed?</p>
<p>Because I got a little pinched nerve in my neck.</p>
<p>It's driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Wh... yeah, I mind.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go take a steam bath, so why don't you whip me up a bowl of that popcorn.</p>
<p>That smells so good.</p>
<p>No. I'm not gonna do that.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no. Frank! Stop!</p>
<p>Don't get all emotional, just do it.</p>
<p>I don't want this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They're asleep.</p>
<p>Dude, why did you say you wanted to raise the kid?</p>
<p>I just got caught up in the moment, you know?</p>
<p>It was so exciting.</p>
<p>Maybe we should do it.</p>
<p>W-we? We are not a couple, Mac.</p>
<p>Well, no, we would just keep pretending.</p>
<p>I am not gonna pretend to be in a relationship with you for the entirety of my child's life.</p>
<p>Are you insane?</p>
<p>Lo... okay, you know what? I can't handle this right now.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go sleep in your room.</p>
<p>You can sleep on the couch.</p>
<p>Oh, no... w-w-wait, Dennis.</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.</p>
<p>Uh, hold on one second... I-I...</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>This is the gym.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And where were you going to sleep?</p>
<p>Well, I figured since we got so used to sleeping in the same bed at Dee's, that we could just sort of continue that here.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You want to sleep on the couch... ( <em>inhales</em> ) ...together.</p>
<p>I'm gonna sleep next to the dildo bike.</p>
<p>The Ass-pounder, uh, 4000, is an exercise... bike.</p>
<p>( <em>door slams</em> )</p>
<p>That was, um...</p>
<p>That was not as bad as I expected.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>It kind of was.</p>
<p>It kind of was amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh. Hmm.</p>
<p>What is this? What are you doing there?</p>
<p>This? Oh, this just Yeah. improves the chances of conception.</p>
<p>Of what?</p>
<p>Of getting pregnant.</p>
<p>Oh. Right.</p>
<p>Uh, the baby.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, speaking of which, um, I think we're gonna need to make some changes around here.</p>
<p>Oh. Like what?</p>
<p>Um, well, I think you need to repaint, for starters.</p>
<p>Wh-why would I do that?</p>
<p>Charlie, this... this paint could be full of lead.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>I can't carry a baby around lead paint.</p>
<p>Or... or, oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Did you expect me to live in the women's shelter while I'm carrying your child?</p>
<p>Oh, no, um...</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about it, but you can stay here.</p>
<p>I mean, that's fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, wow. Oh, thank you so much.</p>
<p>When this baby comes out, though, Frank's gonna need to find us a nicer place to live.</p>
<p>Oh, but I love this place.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I don't, and it's no place to raise a child, so end of conversation.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Hey. Hang on.</p>
<p>You're kind of coming on strong right now.</p>
<p>Are you serious right now?</p>
<p>Well, look...</p>
<p>I'm carrying your child.</p>
<p>N-n-n-n-n-n-no.</p>
<p>Carrying my...</p>
<p>I am not finished talking.</p>
<p>Who's idea was this in the first place?</p>
<p>Look, I'm just saying if you want to be a mom, you're gonna have to learn how to control your emotions.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> ): I need to control my emotions?</p>
<p>Or I'm not gonna be a good mother?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>( <em>snoring</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dee!</p>
<p>I'm in trouble here.</p>
<p>What? What are you doing here?</p>
<p>The waitress is totally, like, moving into my apartment.</p>
<p>I-I-I can't take it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna need to hide out here for a few days.</p>
<p>No. No. Hard no. Get out.</p>
<p>It's like, I didn't think about the whole, like, having a baby thing, you know?</p>
<p>It's like one thing to trap a person with a baby, but then when you actually have a baby, then you become trapped.</p>
<p>What baby thing? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>And plus, it's totally turning her into, like, a different person.</p>
<p>She's, like, acting like a real bitch now.</p>
<p>She's always been a bitch.</p>
<p>Now who's being a bitch, Dee?</p>
<p>Come on, I need help here, all right?</p>
<p>Look, I-I got to sleep, okay?</p>
<p>I can't think straight.</p>
<p>I... ah, Christ... is he snoring?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Snoring's the worst. I'm gonna need to crash next to you, all right? You know what?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Don't be a whore tonight, Dee, and try and bang me again, okay?</p>
<p>Because I got nothing left.</p>
<p>I'm spent; I'm really exhausted.</p>
<p>Too much sex and too much... stuff.</p>
<p>Just don't be a whore, okay?</p>
<p>( <em>snoring</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>whines</em> )</p>
<p>Dee! Egg!</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>Where is it? There's no eggs here.</p>
<p>Where are your eggs?</p>
<p>Dee, where are your eggs?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dee, eggs!</p>
<p>Dee, we're looking for your eggs.</p>
<p>Where are your eggs?</p>
<p>We can't find them!</p>
<p>Come on, leave me alone.</p>
<p>Just let me sleep; I barely slept last night.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Dee. Deandra.</p>
<p>Look, don't be so emotional.</p>
<p>You're being very emotional.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Get up and get us an egg.</p>
<p>I'm getting like calls up the wazoo from the waitress.</p>
<p>She's asking for, like, groceries and shit.</p>
<p>I mean, who does that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who-who just barges into someone's apartment and takes over?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, are you serious?</p>
<p>That's exactly what you guys are doing!</p>
<p>Uh, Dee, eggs, okay? I'm freaking out.</p>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>I just got rid of two annoying roommates.</p>
<p>This is not supposed to be happening.</p>
<p>( <em>phone rings</em> )</p>
<p>God! She's calling me again!</p>
<p>It's like she's totally stalking me.</p>
<p>Dee, what do I do here?</p>
<p>( <em>phone rings</em> )</p>
<p>You have been stalking that woman for 15 years.</p>
<p>Now she's finally showing you some attention, and you don't like it?</p>
<p>Oh, Dee, you know what? Eggs.</p>
<p>I didn't ask for your opinion.</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p>Yes, you did!</p>
<p>Hey, oh, good, Dee.</p>
<p>I need you to watch Brian Jr. for a few hours.</p>
<p>N-n-n-n-n-no.</p>
<p>Y-y-y-y-yeah.</p>
<p>Frank, what the hell are you doing here, man?</p>
<p>You're supposed to be finding my millionaire.</p>
<p>I'm on it. I'm here trying to get her to make us breakfast.</p>
<p>Yeah, we haven't got any eggs.</p>
<p>I need an egg.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Dee, why have you not made this man his egg?</p>
<p>Do you want to take care of this child for the rest of your life, is that what you want?</p>
<p>Or do you want me to get out of this situation that I'm in?</p>
<p>( <em>yelling</em> ): I'm gonna smash it!</p>
<p>Oh, Dee, don't get emotional.</p>
<p>Christ, if you're upset, smash an egg into a pan for Frank.</p>
<p>Solve problems, don't cause them.</p>
<p>Oh, gee whiz, look how fancy this place is.</p>
<p>We don't have anything like this back in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Fascinating.</p>
<p>Um, so, Mandy, um, we have brought you here, uh, to meet a gentleman.</p>
<p>Um, I just feel really Oh. badly now being able to provide emotionally for you, so I thought we could set you up with somebody who can provide for you both emotionally and financially.</p>
<p>Um, so we are here to meet a millionaire.</p>
<p>Oh, geez.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I know.</p>
<p>It's, a, it's a little str... Oh, oh...</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, Frank, where's the, uh, millionaire?</p>
<p>I am the millionaire, I'm the guy.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Mandy, here's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make you a decent proposal.</p>
<p>Not an indecent proposal like in the movie... because I think to pay a million bucks to get laid... that's out of the question.</p>
<p>I'm gonna offer you $5,000.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Frank?</p>
<p>Look, I'm gonna give you $5,000, we bang, you take the money, you go up, you get on a plane, you fly to wherever the hell it is in the sticks, and, uh, you know, $5,000 goes a long way up there.</p>
<p>If you need more money, call me up, come back, we bang again.</p>
<p>Price goes down 'cause I already had you.</p>
<p>But if you want to bring a girlfriend...</p>
<p>( <em>exhales sharply</em> ) price goes back up.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what to say here.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I do.</p>
<p>Five grand is a lot of money... is that offer just out on the table?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna bang you.</p>
<p>I don't want to bang you, either, Frank, but I'll power through for five grand.</p>
<p>Well, no, you wouldn't want to, because you're emotionally involved with me.</p>
<p>Aw. shit. Sorry, Dennis.</p>
<p>Hey. Dennis?</p>
<p>Brian, I meant. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes...</p>
<p>Brian is his name.</p>
<p>Dennis is his sex slave name.</p>
<p>He's my gimp.</p>
<p>What? No. I...</p>
<p>I don't have a sex slave name.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I'm not...</p>
<p>Wait, hold on, what's going on here, Brian?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Look, I'm gonna go to the can and make my morning move.</p>
<p>You want the cash, you come on in, earn it the hard way.</p>
<p>Okay? If the broad comes, order me an egg.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Well, that was a disaster. Frank almost ruined everything.</p>
<p>Okay, do you want me to go down to the car and talk to her?</p>
<p>And spin more perverted tales about me? Why am I a gimp?</p>
<p>Oh, God, just get your kid and get out of here, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll get the kid, but I got to come back because I need to crash here tonight.</p>
<p>I'm not sleeping next to Mac's dildo bike again.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, me too. Your bed is working wonders for my pinched nerve.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna crash here for a little bit too.</p>
<p>I feel like I got to ghost the waitress for a while on this.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stay as well because I need to sleep next to Dennis.</p>
<p>All right, then we're gonna need a lot of eggs.</p>
<p>Dee, how about a carton of eggs?</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>( <em>all clamoring</em> )</p>
<p>No, goddamnit, I didn't want to be wrapped up in this!</p>
<p>( <em>clamoring stops</em> )</p>
<p>I didn't want to be wrapped up in the kid thing, that's your mistake.</p>
<p>Listen to me, I can figure this out, I've got a new plan and you're all gonna goddamn listen up, okay?</p>
<p>It's time for Brian LeFevre to die.</p>
<p>( <em>whispers</em> ): Over here. Over here.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>What... where... what is-what is going on here?</p>
<p>I thought-I thought we were gonna go see the Liberty Bell.</p>
<p>There's no time for that, there's no time.</p>
<p>What... what is going on here, Brian?</p>
<p>All right, listen to me, because we only have a few minutes before they realize they can't hear or see us back here.</p>
<p>What? Who?</p>
<p>My name... my name isn't Brian LeFevre.</p>
<p>My real name... is Dane Brass.</p>
<p>And I hold top secret government information.</p>
<p>Okay? They're after me, that's-that's why everything's been so weird.</p>
<p>That's why I haven't been able to speak openly with you.</p>
<p>And you and Brian Jr., you'll have to get away from me because it's-it's not safe.</p>
<p>What do you mean it's not safe? I don't... ( <em>gasps</em> ) Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You're bleeding!</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Oh, oh. ( <em>groans</em> ) I've been shot.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't hear any gun...</p>
<p>( <em>gunshot</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, well... yeah, not there it is there. That was the sound of it.</p>
<p>Normally you'd... you'd hear it before you see the blood, but, uh, not in this case.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em>) Run! ( <em>yells</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, it's killing me. Run, Mandy, no.</p>
<p>You... you have to run and not ever look back.</p>
<p>Or contact me ever again.</p>
<p>And you'll never get any money or assets from me because if you do, it'll be unsafe for you.</p>
<p>Run!</p>
<p>( <em>tires screech</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>moans</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>They got Dennis.</p>
<p>Dane.</p>
<p>Uh, Dane, of course, Dane.</p>
<p>Dane.</p>
<p>Yeah, he had so many identities, it's hard to remember...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We got to get him to a hospital!</p>
<p>Not a regular hospital, though, 'cause technically, he's not supposed to exist.</p>
<p>A bad guy one.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I've lost my lover.</p>
<p>I'll need a new gimp!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I'm not his lover.</p>
<p>Never had sex. Not a gimp.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) Oh, run, Mandy. Oh.</p>
<p>Good-bye. Uh... good-bye, Mandy, good-bye.</p>
<p>Brian Jr.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Aw.</p>
<p>Well, there it is.</p>
<p>Well... okay.</p>
<p>Are you all finished?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) Come on.</p>
<p>You can open your eyes now, I know you're not dead.</p>
<p>Ah, geez.</p>
<p>You big city folks sure like to complicate things, don't ya?</p>
<p>Look, all I wanted was for Brian Jr. to have a father, but we don't want to be with a man who doesn't want to be with us.</p>
<p>So, I guess we'll just... be getting back to North Dakota now.</p>
<p>Okay, now, you want to come on up here and say good-bye to Brian Jr.?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Um... good-bye and, um... you know, you be... you be good to your mom and, uh...</p>
<p>( <em>soft chuckle</em> )</p>
<p>Okay, you all done?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Bye, Dada.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) Well, all right.</p>
<p>It was sure nice getting to know you all.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Whoever the heck you are.</p>

<p>What are we doing? I can't... I-I can't...</p>
<p>I can't do any of this shit anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p>( <em>music stops</em> )</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Okay, I'm... I'm leaving.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go be a dad.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a-hold on a second, you can't just leave.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah, you can't just go become a dad, Dennis.</p>
<p>That's not the way it works.</p>
<p>You don't know the first thing about it.</p>
<p>Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?</p>
<p>Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did.</p>
<p>With some asshole dad who was never even around.</p>
<p>You talking about me or Bruce?</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? I... this is nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well, hang on a second.</p>
<p>Actually, it's not done.</p>
<p>It's not done, no.</p>
<p>We're still in here.</p>
<p>Shh, just let me...</p>
<p>Don't start talking, I can tell...</p>
<p>( <em>all talking over each other</em> )</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I can't believe he's actually gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's crazy.</p>
<p>Well, now what?</p>
<p>( <em>car alarms blaring</em> )</p>
