<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>All right.</em></p>
<p>Uh, let's get started.</p>
<p>(clears throat) What do you guys want to know?</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>The circumstances surrounding the death of the woman born Maureen Ponderosa captivated South Philadelphia.</em></p>
<p>(indistinct police radio chatter)</p>
<p><em>She was discovered in an alley with a broken neck.</p>
<p>In 2013, Maureen had begun</em></p>
<p><em>her transition to a cat.</em></p>
<p>(cat mews)</p>
<p><em>And in her cat form, she went by the name Bastet to honor the Egyptian god of cats.</em></p>
<p>(cat yowls)</p>
<p><em>The story quickly became fodder for local media.</em></p>
<p>So much for having nine lives.</p>
<p>This cat did not land on her feet.</p>
<p>She landed on her neck.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Authorities soon focused on the suspicious nature of her death.</em></p>
<p><strong>Girard</strong>: <em>My name is Lance Girard.</p>
<p>I've been with the Philadelphia Police Department for 24 years, 12 of which were with the Homicide division.</em></p>
<p>I've seen a lot of things.</p>
<p>A man wants to turn himself into a woman?</p>
<p>Okay. Who am I to judge?</p>
<p>But, really, a cat?</p>
<p>What's next? A watermelon?</p>
<p>(camera clicks)</p>
<p><em>First thing we wanted to establish is to whether the deceased was acting strange.</em></p>
<p>Not like "I'm turning myself into a cat" strange.</p>
<p>More like suicide strange.</p>
<p><em>We learned that she was excited about an upcoming surgery, a, uh, reverse nipplectomy.</p>
<p>That's where they add more nipples.</em></p>
<p>(cat meows)</p>
<p>I guess...</p>
<p>I don't know... she wanted more nipples.</p>
<p>The thought of that just makes me want to blow my lunch.</p>
<p><em>Now, apparently, the ex-husband was on the hook for this surgery due to an alimony arrangement.</em></p>
<p>He wasn't happy about it.</p>
<p>That's when he became our primary suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Was I irritated by this?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, of course I was.</p>
<p>I mean, it was the most expensive procedure yet.</p>
<p>You know, but I-I remained supportive and, uh, kept my cool.</p>
<p>And I never threatened her in any way.</p>
<p>Now, due to the nature of this call, we decided to bring him in for questioning.</p>
<p>(indistinct police radio chatter)</p>
<p><em>And he cooperated.</em></p>
<p>Said he wanted to clear his name.</p>
<p><strong>Girard</strong>: <em>He answered every question.</em></p>
<p>Even offered DNA samples.</p>
<p>Although he did request to draw his own blood, which is kind of strange.</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds was forthright.</p>
<p>Charming, quite frankly.</p>
<p><strong>Girard</strong>: <em>It wasn't until I reviewed the interrogation footage later that I saw it.</em></p>
<p>Something very unsettling.</p>
<p><em>24 years on the job, I'd never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>Two hours.</p>
<p>Never moved.</p>
<p>Never blinked.</em></p>
<p>Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.</p>
<p><em>He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.</em></p>
<p>Of something.</p>
<p>Did I kill Maureen? No.</p>
<p>Am I glad she's dead? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Maureen's family was convinced of Dennis's guilt.</em></p>
<p>(snorts) <em>Maureen?</em></p>
<p>Maureen died three years ago.</p>
<p>Dennis killed Bastet, all right?</p>
<p>And let me tell you something. He did us all a favor.</p>
<p>You ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Despite conjecture, the question still remained: Was there anything in Dennis Reynolds' past that would suggest him capable of murder?</em></p>
<p>Testing. Testing.</p>
<p>Syphilis. Syphilis. (laughs)</p>
<p>That's... Well, yeah...</p>
<p>Well, he kind of... snapped the neck, uh, off a crow one time a little bit.</p>
<p>But that... but that's not not <em>normal right, you know?</p>
<p>(laughs) I mean, it was just like boys</em> being boys. Yeah. That...</p>
<p>Look, we had a totally normal childhood, and...</p>
<p><em>Look, Dennis wouldn't hurt a fly. No way.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</em></p>
<p>She's probably just covering for him because she's afraid he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.</p>
<p>(crow cawing)</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: <em>He didn't just snap it.</p>
<p>He broke the thing's head clean off.</em></p>
<p><em>It was gruesome.</em></p>
<p>(snap)</p>
<p>I still have nightmares about it.</p>
<p>And I'm old.</p>
<p>She told you what?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. No, no.</p>
<p>Look... that crow was injured, and I was simply putting it out of its misery, while, yes, testing the tensile strength of a crow's neck.</p>
<p>Well, yes, there was another crow, but that's because I simply couldn't believe that a crow's neck could be that weak.</p>
<p>Well, yes, there was a third crow, and a fourth, if you must know, but who likes crows?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Look, if you can kill a crow, you can kill a cat.</em></p>
<p>(crow cawing)</p>
<p>(echoing): <em>Cat, cat, cat...</em></p>
<p>That's why I started recording all our conversations.</p>
<p>I suspected Frank was probably recording all of our conversations, because of course he would.</p>
<p>But let me tell you something, he was no fan of Maureen's, either.</p>
<p>He was just trying to deflect attention, which is why I started recording all of our conversations as well.</p>
<p>I could have worn a goddamn IMAX camera around my neck and he wouldn't have noticed.</p>
<p>The old bitch.</p>
<p>And I caught him saying some pretty troubling stuff.</p>
<p>What are we watching here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.</p>
<p>Is that me?</p>
<p>Cats. I'll tell you what to do with cats.</p>
<p>Who shot this thing? Dennis?</p>
<p>Here's what you do with cats.</p>
<p>Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam, we found a cat, we tossed it right in the soup.</p>
<p>Those hungry bastards ate cat soup every day.</p>
<p>What's the worst thing that could happen?</p>
<p>Some little kid choke on a hairball and die.</p>
<p>So then you toss him in the soup.</p>
<p>I was making money hand over foot, literally.</p>
<p>Somebody lost a hand or a foot, I'd toss it in the soup.</p>
<p>(burps)</p>
<p>Well, that's all a lie.</p>
<p>(burps)</p>
<p>Uh, there was no soup.</p>
<p>(burps)</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>There's no sweatshop.</p>
<p>(muffled burping)</p>
<p>Excuse me. I got to go to the can.</p>
<p>(static crackling)</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Investigators wanted to verify the timeline Dennis provided to authorities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Like I told the police, uh,</em></p>
<p>Mac and I were watching a movie back at the apartment, and then I went to the bar.</p>
<p>That's true. We were watching <em>Operation Dumbo Drop.</em></p>
<p>We were doing this amazing thing that I came up with, where we watch an old movie, and then I turn the volume down really low and we make wiseacre remarks the entire time.</p>
<p>Yeah, he didn't come up with it.</p>
<p>It's just <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000.</em></p>
<p>It's a spin on that.</p>
<p>It's exactly that.</p>
<p>Well, there's no robots.</p>
<p>So it's worse.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Dennis. It's funny.</p>
<p>It-It's not funny. It's not funny at all, because you can never think of jokes on the fly.</p>
<p>H-He, like, pauses the movie to try and think of something funny to say, and then he never can think of anything funny, so he ends up just saying a line from <em>Borat</em> or <em>Austin Powers.</em></p>
<p>It's super annoying and played-out, and it's not funny.</p>
<p>Well, uh, like this. "Get in my belly."</p>
<p>But you're never referring to anything when you say it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, baby. Get in my belly."</p>
<p>Well, that's two different characters.</p>
<p>That's Mike Myers.</p>
<p>It's not Mike Myers.</p>
<p>It's... it's multiple characters that Mike Myers plays in-in the same movie.</p>
<p>Multiple characters in the same movie?</p>
<p>What is he, a wizard?</p>
<p>Look, it's funny, Dennis.</p>
<p>It's not funny.</p>
<p>Are we done with this? Can we be done?</p>
<p>I'm tired of saying the same things over and over again.</p>
<p>Well, wait. Wh... hold... Dennis, d-don't leave without me.</p>
<p>I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?</p>
<p><em>NARRATOR: Investigators could find no discrepancies in the timeline.</p>
<p>But then... a twist.</em></p>
<p>He totally could have done it.</p>
<p>Now, supposably, Dennis didn't see Maureen that night, but remember that Maureen was once Dennis's...</p>
<p>(imitates Borat): "Wife. Very nice."</p>
<p>That was Borat.</p>
<p><em>It was Friday, payday.</p>
<p>Maureen always came into Paddy's to pick up her alimony check, ASAP.</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>To avoid confusion, it should be pointed out that in a bizarre twist, Deandra Reynolds refused to be a part of this documentary unless we allowed her to play Maureen in the reenactment.</em></p>
<p>(cat meows)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>And Dennis always made a big show of getting her with the spray bottle.</p>
<p>You know, because cats hate water.</em></p>
<p>(cat yowling)</p>
<p><em>So, you see, Dennis totally saw Maureen that night.</p>
<p>Charlie was there.</em></p>
<p>Why hasn't he spoken up?</p>
<p>Probably because Dennis... intimidated him.</p>
<p>Oh, I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I...</p>
<p>Oh, come on, come on. I didn't lie.</p>
<p>I just left out some facts that are insignificant.</p>
<p>And-and intimidate Charlie? Please. What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Call him on the phone and threaten him?</p>
<p>No, I know. But, I mean, if Mac's gonna do it, then, you know, I'm gonna do it.</p>
<p>(bell clanging)</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>At this point in the interrogation, Christ, I was at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Further inspection of Dennis Reynolds' safe</em></p>
<p><em>revealed a cache of suspicious items.</em></p>
<p>(siren wailing)</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Awesome.</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>So while Mr. Kelly's statements were clearly unreliable and would need to be thrown out, another breakthrough came: autopsy results came back from the lab.</em></p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Look, is getting groomed like a cat by your ex weird?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Is it illegal?</p>
<p>(chuckles) I wish.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>The investigation was at a crossroads.</p>
<p>Then another massive break.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Dennis has an answer for everything.</em></p>
<p>Well, answer me this: Where's the collar?</p>
<p>(camera clicks)</p>
<p>(cat meows)</p>
<p><em>Cats have collars.</em></p>
<p>Maureen's body <em>didn't have a collar on it.</p>
<p>Killers keep trophies.</p>
<p>Alls I'm saying,</em> find the collar, find the killer.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>This is not the first time the collar came up.</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds had, oddly, made the collar an issue during filming.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Hey. Stop!</p>
<p>Stop! Stop with the squirting! Stop! Cool it!</p>
<p>We said one spray and then my line.</p>
<p>I... It was in my contract that we talked...</p>
<p>I put one squirt in there for... on purpose.</p>
<p>And this collar! I... Th-There's something wrong with the collar. It's driving me nuts.</p>
<p>It... is an actual flea collar?</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I-I really think the water activated some kind of, like, chemical agent. My-my neck's burning.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Was the flea collar actually burning her, as she claimed?</em></p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yes, asshole! It was burning my skin!</p>
<p>You want to zoom in on this?!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Hard to say.</p>
<p>But maybe there was another reason she removed it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</em></p>
<p>She's probably just covering for him because she's afraid he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.</p>
<p>(crow caws)</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: <em>Maybe Deandra didn't want to wear the collar in order to cover for her brother and to establish that Maureen never wore a collar at all.</p>
<p>We then discovered something in this piece of footage that blew the doors wide open on this case.</em></p>
<p>Was I a person of interest?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I am an interesting person.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, you know, I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife who fell off of a roof pretending to be a cat.</p>
<p>That's the end of it.</p>
<p>All my stories checked out.</p>
<p>I was cleared. Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Find the collar, find the killer.</p>
<p>Find the collar, find the killer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>...'cause a dog is who I am now!</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrestling announcer</strong>: <em>...hit the referee!</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Find the collar...</em></p>
<p><strong>Mac (imitates Borat)</strong>: <em>"Very nice."</em></p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Find the collar, find the killer.</em></p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Guys, this was an open-and-shut case that was shut months ago.</p>
<p>And Maureen never wore a collar. You guys put that there.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, we needed a big twist at the end to show that you're guilty.</p>
<p>But I'm-I'm not guilty.</p>
<p>What about the security footage of Maureen's death?</p>
<p>I mean, it shows her prancing around on the roof like an asshole, and then she just falls off.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: People don't want to see that, because it's hard evidence, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Like, it's better to actually sit on that footage until, like, maybe episode ten, and then let people decide then if you're guilty or not.</p>
<p>Ten episo... You're gonna do ten episodes of this?</p>
<p>Yeah, but then even then we would keep it vague.</p>
<p>I mean, 'cause that's entertainment, you know?</p>
<p>Someone gets murdered, and then you make a show.</p>
<p>But you never give any actual answers, because that's what people love.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You drag it out. You rake it all over the victim's family.</p>
<p>It's sort of like eating a bag of chips, you know?</p>
<p>It's never gonna actually make you full, and at the end you're sick, but you want to go back for more.</p>
<p>You want more chips.</p>
<p>Murder is chips.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I'm gonna find these tapes, and I'm gonna destroy them.</p>
<p>Well, we have backups, so it...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>That could make a good episode, where he's destroying...</p>
<p>Let's think about that, right? He's destroying the tapes...</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You know what, that would be (imitates Borat): "very nice."</p>
<p>(Mac and Charlie laughing)</p>
<p>Is that Borat?</p>
<p>Yes! See?</p>
<p>He gets it. He's laughing.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause I know he was doing an impression.</p>
<p>He's laughing.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, uh, let me... let me think of another one.</p>
<p>Let me think of another one. "I'll be back."</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh... (stammers) Who is that? Who is that?</p>
<p>(trio chanting backwards)</p>
