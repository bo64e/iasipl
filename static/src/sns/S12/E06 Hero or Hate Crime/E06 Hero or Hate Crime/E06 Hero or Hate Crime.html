<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, man, look at this.</p>
<p>Dog shit.</p>
<p>Did you just step in that on purpose?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I just... you know, I didn't really see it.</p>
<p>You pointed it out to me!</p>
<p>And then you stepped directly in it.</p>
<p>Since when do you read?</p>
<p>What? Nothing. No.</p>
<p>(laughs): Books are stupid.</p>
<p>I don't. I was just... (groans)</p>
<p>It wasn't... like, I didn't time it out.</p>
<p>I mean, why would I do that?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Why are you still standing in it?</p>
<p>It was just an accident, man.</p>
<p>People step in dog shit accidentally all the time.</p>

<p>Well, we would like to thank you so much for taking our case so last-minute.</p>
<p>The other guy was not our style.</p>
<p>Well, I'm very happy to do so.</p>
<p>I do have a few questions.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yup.</p>

<p>That was me, and that's why this whole thing is so cut and dry.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: It's...</p>
<p>Hold on. I purchased the ticket, and therefore the ticket belongs to me.</p>
<p><em>I actually bought the ticket a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>But I didn't realize it was gonna be so goddamn blustery that afternoon.</p>
<p>(wind whistling)</p>
<p>And as I was putting my book into my purse, the ticket flew out and landed on the ground.</em></p>
<p>So, you purchased the ticket two weeks ago.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>And why hadn't you scratched the ticket yet?</p>
<p>Oh... well, that's because nobody ever wins those tickets, right?</p>
<p>But as long as you don't scratch it, then you're not a loser.</p>
<p>You know, in fact, you're a winner.</p>
<p>Potentially.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: God, Dee...</p>
<p>That is so sad!</p>
<p>It's so pathetic.</p>
<p>What are...</p>
<p>It is pathetic.</p>
<p>So sad.</p>
<p>What are you talking... You just said this exact same thing, like, ten minutes ago, talking about how the ticket represented hope and all that bullshit.</p>
<p>Somehow coming from you, it just came off so sad.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second. Motion for sub-arbitration to determine whether or not that's sad.</p>
<p>Motion accepted. All in favor?</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p>Motion passed. It's sad, Dee.</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that while Dee's version is the truth, it's not the whole truth.</p>
<p><em>Why don't we talk about the contents of Dee's purse?</p>
<p>The scratcher ticket, the candy sour worms, the pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to know is... how can a woman who makes less than minimum wage afford such impulse buys?</em></p>
<p>So, you're smoking now, Dee?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Is this about your weight?</p>
<p>Because if it is, you're already too bony.</p>
<p>No, I don't think so.I  mean, I think you're getting pretty tubby in the midsection area.</p>

<p>No, no, that's fine.</p>

<p>Well, at least I have a 46% chance of getting Parkinson's disease, according to a DNA test I took.</p>
<p>The medical journal was because I'm trying to learn as much as I can about this, you know?</p>
<p>And, you guys, according to that, smoking can reduce your risk of...</p>
<p>Oh, my God, who gives a shit?!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dee, this isn't about whether or not you have some horrific neurological disease or whether or not your hands are the right size.</p>
<p>They are, by the way, but your elbows are a mess.</p>
<p>They're too sharp.</p>
<p>I don't like it. They're stabbing me.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>That's not the point, that's not the point.</p>
<p>The point is: how can you actually afford to smoke?</p>
<p>You see, Dee and I had a deal.</p>
<p>I give her money for coffee every morning on the way to work.</p>
<p><em>And she's instructed to give a very generous tip to the cashier, Cassie.</p>
<p>"This is from my boss, Dennis."</p>
<p>Now, this establishes both generosity and authority.</em></p>
<p>Possibly a little dominance.</p>
<p>It's all a very choreographed dance between two soon-to-be lovers.</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>(Dennis chuckles)</p>
<p>Cassie's underage.</p>
<p>(both groan)</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, no, no, what-what?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Cassie is not underage.</p>
<p>Cassie is 21 years old.</p>
<p><em>So, the champagne I was purchasing was to celebrate her legal drinking status.</p>
<p>And to honor her full maturity.</em></p>
<p>(cork pops)</p>
<p>You see, I was waiting for Cassie to mature.</p>
<p>You know, much like an IRA.</p>
<p>Y-You put the money in, then you wait.</p>
<p>And then you make a hefty withdrawal.</p>
<p>(both groaning)</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Before full maturity, yeah, ew.</p>
<p>Yeah, but weren't you just saying that you were doing deposits before maturity?</p>
<p>Uh, no, no, no, no. See, that's where you're wrong.</p>
<p>No, I was, uh, between the ages of 18 and 21, simply making investments.</p>
<p>But not for early deposits?</p>
<p>Well, deposits are part of the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can't make a deposit at all.</p>
<p>(both groaning)</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Ugh, come on, man.</p>
<p>Just...</p>
<p>Okay, just to be clear: a deposit's a load, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That's not what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>No, it's a totally different...</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, with my... no.</p>
<p>Look, not in this particular case, it's not a lo...</p>
<p>It's-it's...</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a load.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>But that's not the point!</p>
<p>That's not the point! The point is: Dee has no rightful claim to that ticket, and I'll prove it.</p>
<p><em>You see, yesterday, after noticing the contents of her purse, I decided to follow her this morning.</p>
<p>Cassie never gets her tip,</em> does she, Dee?</p>
<p>No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee.</p>
<p>I think it's dumb.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>So if you were buying circus peanuts and candy sour worms and cigarettes, I think we all know what that means about the ticket in question, don't we?</p>
<p>I don't. Do you know?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Totally lost.</p>
<p>That means she bought it with my money!</p>
<p>So, technically, that ticket is mine!</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.</p>
<p>Miss Reynolds bought the ticket with Mr. Reynolds' money.</p>
<p>But Mr. MacDonald currently possesses it.</p>
<p>Correct. But I deserve it, and here's why.</p>
<p><em>There we were, right?</p>
<p>We were just walking down the street, minding our own business.</p>
<p>I'd just spotted the perfect pile of dog shit, and naturally I stepped in it.</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm a little confused.</p>
<p>Why would you voluntarily step into the dog feces?</p>
<p>Well, I didn't, really...</p>
<p>You just said you did.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: You said naturally you did...</p>
<p>And we all watched you do it.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right, fine.</p>
<p>I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit so that I would smell of dog shit. Happy?</p>
<p>Less happy.</p>
<p>Why would it make me happy?</p>
<p>I was trying to cover up the smell of the skunk that I let spray me so that there would be no questions.</p>
<p>Well, now I have more questions.</p>
<p>Of course you do.</p>
<p><strong>Like</strong>: why did you let a skunk spray you?</p>
<p>To cover the smell of cologne, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, man. You know what?</p>
<p>Go to the beginning. Go to the first smell!</p>
<p>The first smell that begat all the other smells!</p>
<p>The first smell was cigarettes!I 've been smoking with Dee!</p>
<p>All right? Fine, I said it.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, okay. So, right.</p>
<p>So you thought we would care about the smell of cigarettes, but not the smell of skunk or dog shit.</p>
<p>Mm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't matter anyway, all right, because I deserve the ticket.</p>
<p>Because if the shit shoe's a matcher, Charlie gets the scratcher!</p>
<p>Oh... shit.</p>
<p>What the shit?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>That shirt reeks!</p>
<p>Is that what that smell was?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought it was just him.</p>
<p>It does smell; it smells very bad.</p>
<p>But give me a cigarette; I'll cover it up.</p>
<p>But, look, if it smells like shit, you must acquit.</p>
<p>You know what? If everyone's gonna be smoking on my dime...</p>
<p>Look, nobody is debating whether or not the shoe print is yours.</p>
<p>We all know that it is, because everybody saw you kick me.</p>
<p>We're debating whether or not you actually saved my life.</p>
<p>Which you did not, because I was just about to do a sweet backflip to safety when you...</p>
<p>Oh, bullshit.</p>
<p>He's never once flipped!</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I do flips all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You have never once flipped.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: In the pool?</p>
<p>Which you would not have done had I not warned you, thereby saving your life!</p>
<p>That is my ticket.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Ridiculous. "Backflip."</p>
<p><em><strong>Frank</strong>: There I was, minding my own business, bird watching.</em></p>
<p>Beautiful day, isn't it?</p>
<p>It's really gorgeous and...</p>
<p>Are those mirrors?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You creep.</p>
<p>He wasn't really bird watching, he was looking up women's skirts.</p>
<p>He peeps on women.</p>
<p>That's his move.</p>
<p>He's disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Like I said, bird watching.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Now, the point is that I said, "Look out, faggot," which were the words that saved Mac's life.</p>
<p>Thereby, I am entitled to at least half that ticket.</p>
<p>Well, why did you use the slur instead of just yelling your friend's name?</p>
<p>Well, there was a lot going on.</p>
<p>I needed something that would cut through.</p>
<p>Well, as soon as I said the slur, everybody knew to look at Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Look out, faggot!</p>
<p><em>Mac knew to look.</p>
<p>Dennis and Dee knew to look.</p>
<p>Charlie, who kicked him in the chest, knew to look.</p>
<p>Hell, even the little kid with the balloon knew where to look.</em></p>
<p>Okay, it may have been effective, but it was an offensive slur.</p>
<p>And a bigot should not be entitled to a hero's payout.</p>
<p>You're allowed to use any language you want to save somebody's life.</p>
<p>Really? Any language?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>You gonna let a man die over a word?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. It's just a word.</p>
<p>"Just a word." Oh. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, Frank, tell me something: If you were going to save somebody else's life, you know, from a falling piano, and you needed a word to just... to just cut right through...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>...what word would you use to call out to the arbiter?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>I suppose...</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what? We're, uh, we're treading on some dangerous territory here, buddy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>"Nigger"?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh! Whoa, whoa!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What, what?</p>
<p>Charlie, you can't use that word.</p>
<p>I'm trying to guess the word that he was saying that he thought Frank was gonna say.</p>
<p>No, you don't say that ever.</p>
<p>I was not using the word.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Don't ever... that's not...</p>
<p>You can't use that word, buddy.</p>
<p>And yet, we've just sort of been casually throwing the F-word around willy-nilly for the past few days, and that hasn't been a problem?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, Mac, because the... there's a very dark history associated with... the N-word.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you know that a faggot is a burning bundle of sticks on top of which they used to burn homosexuals?</p>
<p>So, basically, when you call someone a "faggot," you are saying that they should be burned at the stake.</p>
<p>Is that right? That's, uh...</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.</p>
<p>That's pretty dark.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there are a few words that we shouldn't be throwing around.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about "cuոt"?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>We can't lose that!</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a good word.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's tough. It's a great word.</p>
<p>And it's just not offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Especially, uh, directed towards a woman when you're trying to insult her.</p>
<p>(men laughing)</p>
<p>When you're trying to make a woman feel small.</p>
<p>That's extremely offensive!</p>
<p>Come on, you could yell "penis" at me, and I'd be fine with it. Well, all right, fine.</p>
<p>Well, then, we're gonna take away your favorite word.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, "cocksucker"?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's wrong with that?</p>
<p>You can't say "cocksucker" if we can't say "cuոt."</p>
<p>I find it offensive that the idea of sucking cocks is offensive.</p>
<p>Exactly. There's nothing offensive about sucking cock.</p>
<p>Half the population loves to suck cock.</p>
<p>The other half of the population, they love getting their cock sucked.</p>
<p>It's kind of a win-win.</p>
<p>We're getting off the point, okay?</p>
<p>In terms of the ticket, I'm calling bullshit on Frank, because, for some reason, he thinks that I'm gay, and that is why he called me the F-word, which makes him a bigot.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Uh, catch me up here.</p>
<p>Now, you're not gay?</p>
<p>Obviously not.</p>
<p><strong>Faith</strong>: Okay. Interesting.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Reynolds, um, simply, was just trying to disrespect you.</p>
<p>He wasn't trying to make a comment about your sexual orientation?</p>
<p>No, well, see, here's where things get just a little bit tricky, because Frank thinks Mac is gay because...</p>
<p>Mac is gay.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>What?! What-what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Enough with this.</p>
<p>This is boring.</p>
<p>I mean, he's into the closet, he's out of the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We don't like you either way.</p>
<p>Oh, look, now, I care about my body.</p>
<p>So now they become, like, obsessed with me being gay.</p>
<p>Obsessed? We don't care! We're the ones who don't care.</p>
<p>Okay. All right, hold on.</p>
<p>Dee, let me just... let me put this to bed.</p>
<p>Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.</p>
<p>So, just come on out of the closet and be done with it.</p>
<p>You'll feel better.</p>

<p>You know, you guys are just jealous because I've got <em>a million-dollar idea and I've got the ticket.</em></p>
<p>You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!</p>
<p>I bought the ticket.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?! Are you crazy?!</p>
<p>(overlapping arguing)</p>
<p>Quiet! Quiet!</p>
<p>Quiet!</p>
<p>Now, I've heard from everybody involved, and I will make my decision.</p>
<p>But let me make one thing clear.</p>
<p>In order for this to be entirely just, I will make my decision based on fairness and compromise.</p>
<p>You understand?</p>
<p>Okay, I think I'm all caught up.</p>
<p>All right, so what's the verdict?</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you got?</p>
<p>I think it's actually pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald is in possession of the ticket, so he has ownership.</p>
<p>However, he would not be in possession if his life were not saved by Mr. Reynolds, who set off the chain of events saving him.</p>
<p>So I see it as a 50/50 split.</p>
<p>(groaning) - Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I'm a hero!</p>
<p>Oh! You bitch!</p>
<p>50/50 split?</p>
<p>...out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Nothing for the man who paid for the ticket?</p>
<p>I bought it!</p>
<p>And this bigot here is gonna get a hero's payout?</p>
<p>He may be a bigot and he did use disgusting speech, but it's not technically hate speech since Mr. MacDonald does not claim to be gay.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, does that mean if I claim to be gay, I get all of it?</p>
<p>Well, um, y-yes.</p>
<p>You would be entitled to keep all of it.</p>
<p>I claim to be gay!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Now you're gay?</p>
<p>There's a history behind it.</p>
<p>I've been gay forever.</p>
<p>Everybody knows it. Even the balloon kid knew it.</p>
<p>Soon as he gets that ticket, he's going back in the closet.</p>
<p>Yeah. This isn't fair.</p>
<p>Mark my words.</p>
<p>If he's gonna do it, he's got to stay out, which he won't, I guarantee you.</p>
<p>Fine. Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!</p>
<p>Totally out. I'm gonna...</p>
<p>Hey, uh, excuse me, would you please do the honors <em>on my ticket, please?</em></p>
<p>It's probably worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Margie</strong>: Okay. Sure.</p>
<p>Let's, uh... let's see what we have here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, you're a winner.</p>
<p>What? How much?</p>
<p>$10,000.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p>(all exclaiming)</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Gay Mac rules!</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>Gay-gay, rich Mac!</p>
<p>All right, if you will just sign this, releasing the ticket and agreeing to my ruling.</p>
<p>Don't mind if I do.</p>
<p>(Charlie groans)</p>
<p>I wonder what I'm gonna do with all this money.</p>
<p>Maybe start an LLC.</p>
<p>Ass Pounder 4000?</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>It's all going right into the product.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, sign the paper so you can go back in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p>You go back in. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Well, you signed the thing. You got your money.</p>
<p>Just go back in the closet. Just get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: We know you're gonna do it, so you might as well just do it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe I'll... maybe I'll stay out.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>You can just go back in. You signed the paper.</p>
<p>Y-Yeah. I mean, you got your money.</p>
<p>No, I think I'm out now. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm... I'm gay.</p>
<p>Actually feels pretty good.</p>
<p>See ya, guys.</p>
<p>(exhales)</p>
<p>(bike squeaking)</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Eh, good for him, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, good for him. I'm...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Guess I'm happy for him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a relief, honestly.</p>
<p>All right, if, uh, you'll just take care of this, then, uh, we'll be all done.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>That would be a bill.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Oh, money stuff.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>That goes to Frank.</p>
<p>I know it's steep, but you did go through three arbiters, and you've been here 17 hours.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>Yikes, yikes.</p>
<p>What's-what's it add up to there, Frank?</p>
<p>$9,986.</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>Holy cow, you guys aren't cheap.</p>
<p>(chuckles): You guys aren't cheap.</p>
<p>The arbitration was Mac's idea.</p>
<p>Let's let him pay for it.</p>
<p>That's a great idea.</p>
<p>That's fair. In fairness' sake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's got the money for it.</p>
<p>He's got the money now. Yeah.</p>
<p>But maybe let's make him pay it tomorrow, you know?</p>
<p>L-Let's let him have this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Poor guy did just come out over a $14 scratcher.</p>
<p>That's all that's left?</p>
<p>(chuckles): Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>That sucks.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p>Tell you what, man, I am happy for him, but I do still hate him.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's not a gay or straight thing, is it?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>It's a Mac thing.</p>
