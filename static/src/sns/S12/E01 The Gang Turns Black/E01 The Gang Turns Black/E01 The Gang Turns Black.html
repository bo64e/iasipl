<p>Well, we did have a black president before the orange one.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that doesn't mean there's not problems.</p>
<p>I mean, what about the whole, like, Black Lives Matter thing?</p>
<p>Uh, well, sure, no, good point.</p>
<p>But, I mean, I don't know why it took 'em so long to realize that their lives matter.</p>
<p>I mean, they-they've always mattered, you know? But I would also say that all lives matter, you know?</p>
<p>And while black people may not feel like it, it's kind of tough out there right now for everybody.</p>
