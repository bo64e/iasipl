<p>We did it! We're gonna be rich!</p>
<p>We're gonna be rich.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>All right, Cowboy, how you feeling right now?</p>
<p>I'm feeling good. Ready to put on a show for all these guys.</p>
<p>(Mac and Charlie cawing)</p>
<p>What the hell is going on? Who are these guys?</p>
<p>Uh, just like to take the opportunity to thank Fight Milk.</p>
<p>Yes, and thank you, Cowboy, and thank you, Megan.</p>
<p>We'd also like to take this opportunity to announce that Fight Milk is now the official drink of the UFC.</p>
<p>Official drink.</p>
<p>Now if you're in...</p>
<p>(microphone feedback)</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>This is not the official drink of the UFC.</p>
<p>And I don't know who these guys are.</p>
<p>Security, get these assholes out of here!</p>
<p>Fight Milk!</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Fight Milk! Fight Milk!</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: Fight Milk! Fight Milk! Fight Milk!</p>
<p>Fight Milk! Fight Milk!</p>
<p><strong>Man (on Tv)</strong>: The nationwide hatred for Wolf Cola continues to intensify on an hourly basis...</p>
<p>Holy shit. We're getting hammered worse than before.</p>
<p>Bye-bye, Frank's Fluids.</p>
<p>Turns out there are<em> two</em> things that can't be forgiven... raping children and disliking dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well, what am I gonna do with all the merchandise, man?</p>
<p>Throw it in the garbage, burn it. Who gives a shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're done. Fight Milk shit the bed.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Chet (on Tv)</strong>: Breaking news from the sports world.</p>
<p>Fighters at a UFC event in Philly tested positive for several banned substances, stemming from an energy drink called Fight Milk.</p>
<p>We pumped it full of human growth hormone, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, just nothing else was working.</p>
<p>It just... it was just giving people diarrhea.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Starting to become known as the official drink of the UFC, this Fight Milk is a serious smudge for the group, and a potential public relations nightmare.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Holy shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You guys, this is good.</p>
<p>This is good. We're freed, and they are screwed.</p>
<p>See, this is actually the one<em> good</em> thing about the 24-hour news cycle.</p>
<p>If you give it enough time, something new will come along to replace peoples' old outrage with new outrage.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Fight Milk, except that it's made right here in Philadelphia by a parent company known as Frank's Fluids.</p>
<p><em>Goddamn</em> it!</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>Start the clock.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
