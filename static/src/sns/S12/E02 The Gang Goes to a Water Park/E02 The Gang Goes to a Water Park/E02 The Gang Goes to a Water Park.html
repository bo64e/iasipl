<p>(children coughing)</p>
<p>Oh, Christ, does every single one of these kids have the flu?</p>
<p>Seems like it.</p>
<p>All right, now I bet you guys are wondering what's going on with this racing suit, huh?</p>
<p>No, not even a little bit.</p>
<p>You're like, "What's that rascal Charlie up to?"</p>
<p>"What's he up to this time?" Right, right?</p>
<p>I'm not thinking that at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, it's an issue of aerodynamics, really.</p>
<p>You see, every second counts in the water park.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we plan to ride every single ride in there today.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Yeah, the brochure says three days.</p>
<p>We're saying bullshit to that.</p>
<p>We're gonna get it done in one.</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<p>All right, well, good luck with that 'cause you got, like, ten minutes of clean water and then every slide's basically a urine delivery system.</p>
<p>Yeah. - (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: We're not gonna get drenched in piss.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're gonna go in there, find our favorite ride, bomb down it once, Yeah. then sit by the pool the rest of the day disease-free.</p>
<p>Don't kid yourself about the water, buddy.</p>
<p>You're not gonna be disease-free; this water's already infested with every parasite on the planet.</p>
<p>And I, for one, have no intention of stepping foot in any of it.</p>
<p>So what do you come to a water park for?</p>
<p>Hot food, cold beer, bikini'd women seeking relief from the insufferable prison of motherhood.</p>
<p>Yeah, lot of pleasures to be had at the park, Frank.</p>
<p>None of which involve piss.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>And it's all free, too, if you know how to get it.</p>
<p>Well, it's not free, you got to pay to get in.</p>
<p>Not me, I had my bracelet laminated in the '90s.</p>
<p>I haven't paid to get in here since I was 14.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Nice, nice.</p>
<p>Oh, smart.</p>
<p>Oh, shush! Shush, shush, shush, shush, they're about to open!</p>
<p>Why do we have to shush?</p>
<p>Oh, guys! I almost forgot.</p>
<p>Do not go near the pool drains, no matter how good you might think they feel on your butt.</p>
<p>What? - Huh?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You do not sit on those!</p>
<p>You know, because of the suction on your butthole?</p>
<p>No one's thinking about that, man.</p>
<p>(all disagreeing)</p>
<p>No one's thinking about that at all.</p>
<p>Oh, good, 'cause it is bad news.</p>
<p>Those things will suck the intestines right out of you.</p>
<p>Like it did to that one kid back in '96.</p>
<p>Now, she had to chew through her intestines just to get free.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: When I see the drain, I'm not gonna go try and sit on it.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go! Here we go!</p>
<p>We got to go! Get in there!</p>
<p>Go! Go! Go!</p>

<p>Uh, it's a urine tester.</p>
<p>Just want to be 100% sure.</p>
<p>It turns light red at the slightest hint of piss.</p>
<p>And I think we're good.</p>

<p>Yeah, no shit!</p>
<p>Dee, you got to move.</p>
<p>Me move? You move.</p>
<p>You're blocking me.</p>
<p>Your stupid wrist band got us all jammed up.</p>
<p>It's not just that.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>The slide's too small, the nerd was right.</p>
<p>shit, what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Uh... okay. Just remain calm, all right?</p>
<p>Do not panic, that's the worst thing you can do.</p>
<p>Okay, but we got to get unstuck before they send another kid because... oh, God, some big, fat kid's just gonna come blasting down on us.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You're gonna be fine. Trust me.</p>
<p>(thud, both yell)</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: This is slow, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm never gonna get through this crap.</p>
<p>We should've gone down the first slide we saw.</p>
<p>I know, I know, but we needed to start at the northmost point of the park, right?</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Then we work our way south, Yeah. and that cuts back on the excess running back and forth.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that said, I'm sorry I got us so lost.</p>
<p>I can't ever tell which way is north on a map.</p>
<p>It's at the top.</p>
<p>I thought north was, like, up.</p>
<p>"Up"?</p>
<p>Yeah, like if I turn the map this way, now where is north?</p>
<p>Still at the top of the... no.</p>
<p>Down?</p>
<p>Now, come on, Charlie, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>It's confusing, right?</p>
<p>We got to get going here.</p>
<p>I know, goddamn it.</p>
<p>Where's he going?</p>
<p>Coming through. Excuse us.</p>
<p>What, what?</p>
<p>How come he can cut to the front?</p>
<p>Oh, Ethan is here with a special program for children with leukemia, so he skips to the front of the line.</p>
<p>Thank you! Coming through.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: AIDS!</p>
<p>AIDS, I got AIDS. I got AIDS, we're coming through.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Cutting through.</p>
<p>I'm his doctor, my patient's got to get to the front of the line Yeah.</p>
<p>Because he has AIDS.</p>
<p>I got the AIDS.</p>
<p>He got it from a gay guy in the '80s.</p>
<p>I'm not gay, I didn't... but...</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>There's two kind of AIDS... there's the vagina AIDS and then the needle-based AIDS.</p>
<p>I-I'm a vagina guy.</p>
<p>Well, no, actually my test results show I got... sorry, I'm... AIDS. that it was the gay AIDS.</p>
<p>All AIDS are bad.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>That's... no good AIDS.</p>
<p>But I'm telling you, like I said, this is not the gay AIDS.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, he's adorable.</p>
<p>(chuckling)</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>Oh, daughter, yeah.</p>
<p>I try to take her to fun places like this.</p>
<p>Let a little sunshine back into her life ever since her mom...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Did she...</p>
<p>Die horrifically?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Drowning. Kind of ironic, us being at a water park, but, you know, you got to... you got to roll with the punches, you know?</p>
<p>Got to get back out there and live life...</p>
<p>Daddy, Daddy, can I borrow $20?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, hi there, what's your name?</p>
<p>Abby.</p>
<p>I'm hungry, Daddy.</p>
<p>Can I please have $20?</p>
<p>Well, I think you can get something to eat for a lot less than that, hon.</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>I'm hungry, I'm starving, and you haven't given me any money.</p>
<p>(sighs) Yeah.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>

<p>Anything for my little...</p>
<p>Abby.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I'm done with you.</p>
<p>Keep up.</p>
<p>Aah! Jesus.</p>
<p>You'd think all the pressure would blast us through.</p>
<p>No, it's just squeezing me further into the stuck!</p>
<p>Okay, well, get-get the bracelet off.</p>
<p>Just rip it off.</p>
<p>Dee, I'm trying.</p>
<p>I can't get any actual leverage on it.</p>
<p>Besides, it's triple-laminated.</p>
<p>It's not just gonna rip.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I think someone peed.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Sherman, did you pee?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Sherman, my vial is turning light pink.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Ugh... goddamn it, Sherman, I ordered you not to pee!</p>
<p>Sorry!</p>
<p>Oh, disgusting!</p>
<p>Sorry's not gonna cut it, Sherman, it's not gonna cut it.</p>
<p>Nobody else pee!</p>
<p>Ah, the sun's just blasting me right in the face.</p>
<p>Why does it have to be right there?</p>
<p>Dee, if God put the sun there, there's probably a reason, okay?</p>
<p>Don't question him; we need God!</p>
<p>God didn't put the sun anywhere.</p>
<p>The sun stays still; the Earth moves around it.</p>
<p>(all scream)</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>We gotta get these kids out of here.</p>
<p>All right. I'm going for it. I'm just pulling on one of 'em.</p>
<p>Come on. Ah, this friggin' dome's like a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Get him through, I can get him.</p>
<p>(Mac grunts)</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Get help.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Kid, kid, kid, listen. Come here.</p>
<p>Before you go, no matter how alluring it is, do not put your genitals or your butthole near the pool drain. You got it?</p>
<p>In fact, cover your butthole.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Okay, go.</p>
<p>Okay, kid. Go, kid, go!</p>
<p>Come on. Go.</p>
<p>Cover that butthole, kid!</p>
<p>Mac. Stop talking to children about their buttholes, okay?</p>
<p>It's not appropriate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, I think we gotta get another kid out.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>What about this one?</p>
<p>That kid looks passed out, Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's out cold, but I think I can maneuver his body pretty easily.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we send him down there, he might drown.</p>
<p>Guys, I gotta take a poop.</p>

<p><strong>Man</strong>: I see you stealing.</p>
<p><strong>Abby</strong>: I wasn't stealing them!</p>

<p>Where have you been? I've been worried sick about you.</p>
<p>This your daughter?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Officer Dennis Reynolds.</p>
<p>Hi. Off-duty, of course.</p>
<p>This is your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Look, I caught her stealing sunglasses.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>No, I didn't! I was just...</p>
<p>Abigail, I gave you $20 to buy whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>What happened to that? Do you still have it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, then you need to pay for these sunglasses.</p>
<p>Actually, no. You know what?</p>
<p>On second thought, no.</p>
<p>You don't get the sunglasses.</p>
<p>You need to be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>I think that she gets...</p>
<p>I really appreciate everything that you do.</p>
<p>Real police officer to security guard, honestly, I want to thank you for everything.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>This little girl, she's gonna be grounded for a month.</p>
<p>Come on, Abigail, let's go.</p>
<p>Try to touch me, and I'll scream "rape."</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I see the road you're headed down: the lying, the stealing, all of it.</p>
<p>And as somebody who's been down that road, let me tell you something: you've got real talent.</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>That ought to work.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, it's a simple lunch play.</p>
<p>I tell the burger stand some hyperactive brat knocked my food on the ground, they replace it, no questions asked.</p>
<p>I usually just swipe a burger off some dumb-ass family while they're not looking.</p>
<p>Well, that begs the question, Abigail: you want to be a thief or do you want to be an artist?</p>
<p>You see, an artist takes whatever he wants when somebody's looking right at him.</p>
<p>These are too small for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>It's, uh, Thunder Gun Express.</p>
<p>We just finished construction.</p>
<p>It'll be open in a few weeks.</p>
<p>A Thunder Gun ride?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the movie?</p>
<p>Yeah, but there's no water or anything yet, so we still have to test it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's totally dry.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It's not, it's not... no, but it's not, it's, it's not open yet.</p>
<p>It's Thunder Gun, man. No hesitation.</p>

<p>I've got an idea!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>If we can get Sherman's mouth to this bracelet, we can get out of here.</p>
<p>You said you couldn't rip through it.</p>
<p>No, I can't.</p>
<p>But Sherman can chew through it!</p>
<p>Like the girl in the pool drain when she got her anus stuck, she chewed through her prolapsed anus and chewed herself to freedom.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?!</p>
<p>Sherman!</p>
<p>Get your mouth to this bracelet and chew!</p>
<p>Aw, screw it. Try it.</p>
<p>Chew like you've never chewed before.</p>
<p>Go, Sherman, chew!</p>
<p>(indistinct chatter)</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?</p>
<p>I got some boy to give me this.</p>
<p>I said I'd kiss him if he met me in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Then I swiped his wristband, so he can't get back in.</p>
<p>(laughs) Nice.</p>
<p>Thanks. Well, I got to roll.</p>
<p>What do you mean? Where you going?</p>
<p>We're just getting started.</p>
<p>Yeah, but my mom said it's time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>That's a disappointing glimpse into your future.</p>
<p>Now, why don't you tell your mom you want to stick around for a little while?</p>
<p>That won't work.</p>
<p>She never listens to me.</p>
<p>Oh, now, see, no. That bothers me.</p>
<p>A genius whose fate is controlled by an idiot?</p>
<p>You think I'm a genius?</p>
<p>Yes! Yes, I think you're a genius.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>When I was your age, I couldn't have accomplished half the things you did today.</p>
<p>See, this is why the Chinese are destroying us.</p>
<p>If you were born in China, you'd be the head of some factory by now.</p>
<p>Or they would've thrown you in a river, 'cause you weren't a boy.</p>
<p>All right, it's not a great analogy, but you get my point.</p>
<p>A-Abby... you deserve better.</p>
<p>Here, I... I want you to have it.</p>
<p>No, what do you mean? You earned that.</p>
<p>No, please, take it.</p>
<p>So you never forget me.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dennis.</p>
<p>For being the first adult to actually give a shit about me.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You!</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>We need to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Your daughter is a special kid.</p>
<p>A gifted child who should be treasured.</p>
<p>If she were born in China, she...</p>
<p>Wait, I already did that.</p>
<p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>If she were born in...</p>
<p>What country treasures their women?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What am I talking about?</p>
<p>Mom, can I have a slushy?</p>
<p>Yes, in just a minute.</p>
<p>Is that Abby's brother?</p>
<p>I don't have a daughter.</p>
<p>Yes, you do. The girl that was just...</p>
<p><em>ABBY: Please take it.</em></p>
<p>So you never forget me.</p>
<p><em>DENNIS: See, an artist takes whatever he wants...</em></p>
<p>...when somebody's looking right at him.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you? Why are you...?</p>
<p>(shushing)</p>
<p>(quietly): Huh.</p>
<p>(Charlie whistles)</p>
<p>How would you even describe something like that?</p>
<p>It's so beautiful.</p>
<p>They should've sent a poet.</p>
