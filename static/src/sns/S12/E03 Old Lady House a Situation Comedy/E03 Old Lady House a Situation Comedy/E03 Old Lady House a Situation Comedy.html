<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>No, your mom is the monster, all right?</p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>Oh, the sweet one?</em></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Uh, look, if anything, my mom's aggravatingly sweet, but we're not having an argument about who's sweeter, what...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, hang on a second here, guys.</p>
<p>What are you going on about?</p>
<p>All right, look, my mom's been calling me, like, all the time, okay?</p>
<p>She's clearly upset.</p>
<p>Well, how would you know? You don't even answer.</p>
<p>My mom stopped calling me altogether.</p>
<p>Your mom stopped calling you the day the phone was invented.</p>
<p>My mom has a great relationship with me.</p>
<p>She never calls you!</p>
<p>She calls me all the time!</p>
<p>Yes, she does!</p>
<p>But I have proof, anyway.</p>
<p>I have proof. Look at this.</p>
<p>I got this in the mail.</p>
<p>Is that, like, a ransom note from Mac's mom?</p>
<p>Huh? No. This... my mom sent this.</p>
<p>Oh. Why would your mom write a ransom note to herself?</p>
<p>Oh, it's not a... it's not a ransom note.</p>
<p>This is just how she writes notes to me.</p>
<p>That-that's like a bunch of gibberish, Charlie.</p>
<p>I don't know...</p>
<p>Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the animal my mom fears the most, right?</p>
<p>She-she feels trapped inside her own home.</p>
<p>There is no way you could get that from this.</p>
<p>Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>I think I have a pretty simple solution here.</p>
<p>You see, ever since I moved in with Mac, and Dee and Old Black Man, my surveillance system's just lying around in storage.</p>
<p>I got about a baker's dozen of cameras.</p>
<p>They're just sitting there.</p>
<p>I say we set them up in your mom's home and find out what's really going on in there.</p>
<p>That could work. I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>Great idea.</p>
<p>You don't think that's creepy?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p>He's talking about spying on your moms.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>You can't spy on unsuspecting women.</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Uh, they're not women. They're old.</p>
<p>At a certain point a woman goes from being a woman to just being an old person.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Well, what happens to a man?</p>
<p>A man lives and then dies. Why are we having this argument?</p>
<p>A man remains a man.</p>
<p>Dennis, it's a great idea.</p>
<p>Okay, and no one's gonna get hurt.</p>
<p>It's not like they're gonna get exploited in any way, right?</p>
<p>No, no, no, exactly. I think once we have a look at what's going on in there, we might find the situation to be, uh, pretty comical.</p>

<p>Oh, but this makes me feel so much better.</p>
<p>Now that I know that you're watching me.</p>
