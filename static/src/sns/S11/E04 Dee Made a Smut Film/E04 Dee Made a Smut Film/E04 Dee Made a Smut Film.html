<p><strong>Dee</strong>: <em>Hey, guys. Here we go. I'm ordering it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>:<em> Drop the bluff, Dee. No one believes you're in an actual movie.</em></p>
<p>You guys are gonna feel hella stupid when you see me acting in a feature film. "Hella." Are we saying "hella" now?</p>
<p>'Cause I like it. No, we're not saying "hella," okay?</p>
<p>No. Nobody's saying "hella" anymore.</p>
<p>I never really got to say it. "Hella" came and went. Me, neither.</p>
<p>Dee, can we watch something else?</p>
<p>Can we watch, like, a superhero movie or something?</p>
<p>This is such a waste of our...</p>
<p>Oh, that's a nice opening shot. Symmetrical vista.</p>
<p>It's beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Directed by Pedro Vyes. Who's he?</p>
<p>He's, like, this foreign art house director.</p>
<p>Oh. Ooh... Foreign director. Very impressive.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys, be quiet. This is my scene.</p>
<p>Pretty early for a whiskey.</p>
<p>Or pretty late.</p>
<p>Why don't you make it a double.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? A little hair of the dog that bit you?</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>Yeah, Dee,</em></p>
<p>I got to hand it to you. Y-You've been talking about doing this for years, and... Is that Richard Grieco?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Aw, Grieco. I love that guy. Where's he been?</p>
<p>Richard Grieco is in an art house movie?</p>
<p>That seems odd. That's a little strange.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a little stra...</p>
<p>But, you know, they-they always got to get some kind of a name in order to finance the mo...</p>
<p>Oh, now he's being blown.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>(gang exclaiming, laughing)</p>
<p>Okay. Now-now this makes sense.</p>
<p>So, Dee, you clearly made a porn. This is a porno!</p>
<p>What? No? It's not a porn. You guys, the-the foreigners, they have a much more evolved view of sex.</p>
<p>This is... this is art.</p>
<p>(woman grunting)</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>Dee, what channel did you order this from?</p>
<p>Cinemax.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Cinemax?!</p>
<p>Dee, Cinemax doesn't make art.</p>
<p>You guys, Pedro is-is an edgy, foreign director.</p>
<p>Where's he from?</p>
<p>Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico?</p>
<p>Puerto Rico!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p>Dee, you made a Skinemax flick with a Puerto Rican pervert.</p>
<p>Congratulations. Good thing you got us all together.</p>
<p>Listen, hey, I did not make a smut film.</p>
<p><strong>Grieco</strong>: Gobble that cock.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>Now, why is Grieco</em> resorting to Skinemax?</p>
<p>He's got a great career. He's doing fine.</p>
<p>Actually, it makes sense. I mean, erotic films are very, very in right now.</p>
<p>I mean, Grieco probably didn't realize he was doing a porn.</p>
<p>I think he thought he was doing the next <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> or whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, it's a... it's a fine line these days between art and smut.</p>
<p>It really is. Art's a tricky thing.</p>
<p>The whole art world is bullshit nowadays.</p>
<p>I mean, like, anything can be considered art. I'll bet you Charlie's doodlings could be considered art by some people.</p>
<p>Well, that's 'cause my drawings <em>are</em> art.</p>
<p>You're not an artist, dude. You're drawing with chalk.</p>
<p>No, I'm drawing with marker and, like, pen and stuff.</p>
<p>I'm just eating the chalk.</p>
<p>Charlie, don't eat chalk.</p>
<p>Well, it settles my stomach.</p>
<p>My stomach's a little...</p>
<p>If your stomach hurts, eat a Tums.</p>
<p>What's the difference?</p>
<p>One is chalk!</p>
<p>Well, I don't like wasting Tums.</p>
<p>Tums is very good to draw with.</p>
<p>This maniac is an artist?</p>
<p>I'll bet you if I hung one of Charlie's doodles in a modern art gallery, people would not know the difference.</p>
<p>Mm. No. No, I disagree.</p>
<p>No, art has to come from a more meaningful place.</p>
<p>It can't just be silly nonsense.</p>
<p>I mean, take my erotic memoirs, for example. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Now, that was art.</p>
<p>That was smut.</p>
<p>No, dude, what I do is art. And you know what else?</p>
<p>I think I should film it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, guys, I'd be a fool not to ride this erotic tidal wave our culture seems to be on, film it, do the next<em> Fifty Shades of Grey,</em> my style, you know?</p>
<p>My film would be real, it would be tasteful, it would be... it would be subtle.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be some goddamn Puerto Rican smut.</p>
<p>I'm down to try this, like, art gallery idea of yours.</p>
<p>What do you think Grieco would do?</p>
<p>He wouldn't eat chalk.</p>
<p>Yes, but I just don't understand why you're choosing to dress like Richard Grieco.</p>
<p>Well, because he's a cool bro and I'm a cool bro.</p>
<p>I just want to do a Grieco thing. I'm vibing with it.</p>
<p>I'm vibing with it, man. Stop saying that you're vibing and "bro."</p>

<p>That's not part of the, uh, whole thing.</p>
<p>It's very disturbing.</p>
<p>It's very avant-garde.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What do you think it's all worth?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Ango, what do you think?</p>
<p>Millions.</p>
<p>I'd trade my limbs for it.</p>
<p>Well, the market is dictated by what people will pay, so...</p>
<p>Well, right, but how much are<em> you</em> willing to pay for it?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(laughs) Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>I'm really not interested in buying anything.</p>
<p>But you own an art gallery.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Oh.</p>
<p>I<em> rent</em> an art gallery, or more accurately, my parents rent one for me.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>So that painting I bought from you was worthless?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>It meant something to you.</p>
<p>It's worth exactly what you paid.</p>
<p>I want to sell it back. Okay.</p>
<p>In that exchange, it would only be worth what<em> I</em> would pay for it, which is, again, um, nothing.</p>
<p>I-I don't get it.</p>
<p>When is stuff art?</p>
<p>Uh, hey, guys, guys, um, if I may, I think I can sum this all up.</p>
<p>You see, art is an ambiguous thing, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, just because you make some art, it doesn't mean that you're an artist.</p>
<p>But, also, it<em> does</em> mean you're an artist.</p>
<p>But does it mean that that art is good art?</p>
<p>Is art good just because the right people say it's good?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>That's-that's how it works.</p>
<p>Yeah, but keep in mind, you know, a lot of modern art is... is trash.</p>
<p>I mean, it's shitty.</p>
<p>It's not...</p>
<p>You know, it's not good.</p>
<p>It's terrible.</p>
<p>You know? And yet, it's a fine line between van Gogh and Van Damme, you know, between Depp and Grieco, between Banksy and Charlie, that makes it very difficult to determine what's good art.</p>
<p>You know, what's high art?</p>
<p>What has worth?</p>
<p>What has meaning?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>But if one thing has become abundantly clear to me today-- and it should be to all of you, as well-- is that I wasn't raped.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>We had a good time, she and I.</p>
<p>Yeah? It was a... it was a two-way road.</p>
<p>The whole thing was... mutual.</p>
<p>And the woman in no way looked like Rick Moranis.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>She totally did. I remember her.</p>
<p>Remember her? Yeah.</p>
<p>Um...Oh, no.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even sleep with her.</p>
