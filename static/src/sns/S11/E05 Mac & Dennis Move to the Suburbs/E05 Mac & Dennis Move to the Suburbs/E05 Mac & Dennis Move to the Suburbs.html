<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>Hey, Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee! Do you want to take your feet off my bed, please?</em></p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: <em>It's not your bed, okay? It's my goddamn floor!</em></p>
<p>And how many times do I have to ask you guys to please just pick up your shit when you wake up in the morning!</p>
<p>You're turning this place into the Superdome.</p>
<p>Superdome? That's, like, six years too late.</p>
<p>That's a super lame reference.</p>
<p>And it's kind of offensive.</p>
<p>You'll be happy to know, by the way, we are looking for a place right now.</p>
<p>All right? What about this place, man?</p>
<p>Ah, it looks a little bit junky.</p>
<p>It kind of reminds me of here.</p>
<p>Yeah, this place is a piece of shit.</p>
<p>It's not junky, okay?</p>
<p>You guys have destroyed everything, and that's why it looks junkier, like a couple of locusts.</p>
<p>Oh, I take that as a compliment.</p>
<p>It's not a compliment.</p>
<p>Well, it's biblical, so it's a compliment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(stammers) Why is everything so goddamn expensive? I mean, I wish we hadn't burned down our rent-controlled apartment.</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Yeah, you think?</p>
<p>Dee, I will slap you in the teeth.</p>
<p>You think this is easy?</p>
<p>We-we have a list of demands here.</p>
<p>We need two bedrooms.</p>
<p>We-we need two bathrooms, minimum.</p>
<p>You know what? Whatever.</p>
<p>What's your plan?</p>
<p>Where are you guys gonna find a place that fits all of your needs for under 1,500 bucks a month?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Well, guys,</em> this is it.</p>
<p>Welcome to our beautiful new home.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: This is crazy. You guys should've just moved into that empty apartment in our building.</p>
<p>The one where the family was murdered?</p>
<p>Brutally murdered.</p>
<p>Pass. This place is awesome.</p>
<p>You guys are gonna thrive out here, and I am not gonna have to worry about you hogging my shower anymore.</p>
<p>And we don't have to worry about getting ringworm.</p>
<p>You brought the ringworm.</p>
<p>Yeah, and now your apartment is infested with it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Don't worry, you'll be back to giving each other worms soon enough.</p>
<p>These are city scum.</p>
<p>They can't hack it out here.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to bet?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank. So if Mac and I can live here for a month, then you have to pay our rent for an entire year.</p>
<p>Deal. And if you don't, you have to sleep in bed with an old man for a year.</p>
<p>(laughing): Gross!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you laughing about, Charlie?</p>
<p>You already sleep with an old man, and for no reason other than you seem to enjoy it.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, Frank?</p>
<p>You got a bet.</p>
<p>Won't last a month-- Frank is insane!</p>
<p>This place is paradise, man.</p>
<p>We can really stretch out, you know?</p>
<p>It-it's quiet, it's calm.</p>
<p>It's not like the city where everything is so stressful, you know?</p>
<p>I'm-I'm just... I feel at ease.</p>
<p>When was the last time that we had a home-cooked meal?</p>
<p>Oh, dude... (stammers) it's been forever.</p>
<p>Well, my friend, dig in.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Mac... this is incredible.</p>
<p>You like it?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, that is such a relief because I worked so hard on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I call it Mac's famous mac and cheese.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Okay, well, I don't know how...</p>
<p>I don't really know how famous it is.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm your roommate, and I've never heard of it.</p>
<p>So, what do you want to do after dinner?</p>
<p>Uh... well, see, the TV's not hooked up, so can't watch TV.</p>
<p>Um, there's not really any bars around here, so...</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know what we should do?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Let's just get a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(faint chirp nearby)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>What was what?</p>
<p>(chirps again)</p>
<p>You hear that, that chirping sound?</p>
<p>I did not, no.</p>
<p>Probably a smoke detector or something like that, huh?</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>Hey, to a great night's sleep.</p>
<p>(crickets trilling)</p>
<p>(low hissing)</p>
<p>(smoke detector chirping)</p>
<p>(fan blades swooshing)</p>
<p>(distant lawn mower humming)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Hey, man, did you hear that...?</p>
<p>The pool filter?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It was like a jet engine.</p>
<p>I didn't get any sleep at all last night, you know?</p>
<p>One noise is so much louder than all the city noises combined, you know?</p>
<p>You just, you fixate.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I get that, but I-I was actually talking about that chirping sound-- did you hear that?</p>
<p>It was, like, happening all night.</p>
<p>No, I didn't hear that.</p>
<p>Oh, man, it was driving me nuts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, want to roll?</p>
<p>I, uh, got us some music.</p>
<p>I made this Creed mix.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, Creed, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a long commute, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking more, like, Bryan Adams.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it-it is Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Which is technically my music day.</p>
<p>Right, it's...</p>
<p>Yeah, and that was cool and all when it only took us, like, ten minutes to get to work, but now we're looking at, like, an hour or so commute.</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe more my thing.</p>
<p>But hey, you know what?</p>
<p>Here's an idea.</p>
<p>Why don't you take a personal day?</p>
<p>You know, I mean, we got a lot of property here.</p>
<p>It might be nice to have someone here to look after it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, maybe get that TV working.</p>
<p>Maybe take a run at that, uh, pool filter?</p>
<p>Oh. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>You must be the new neighbors.</p>
<p>Name's Wally Schmidt.</p>
<p>No relation to Mike.</p>
<p>But don't tell my wife. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Boy, it sure is a hot one today, huh?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you boys.</p>
<p>What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p>He just comes up and starts talking to us?</p>
<p>Right, some guy comes up to me, I don't know what he's...</p>
<p>I don't know what he's up to.</p>
<p>No. It's like the whole time, I'm staring at him, I'm thinking, does he have a knife?</p>
<p>Are we gonna have to take this bitch out right now?</p>
<p>No. I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But it's-it's the city, though.</p>
<p>It-it's forced me to develop these sharp edges.</p>
<p>For protection, you know?</p>
<p>I got to smooth them out.</p>
<p>We're in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Let's work on it a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Shall we? You know, 'cause now I'm all tense.</p>
<p>I don't want to bring this energy into work, you know?</p>
<p>Luckily, I got the commute to relax.</p>

<p>I couldn't follow any of it.</p>
<p>What did you do today?</p>
<p>Did you, uh, fix that pool filter?</p>
<p>Uh... I tried.</p>
<p>But it turns out it's actually really complicated, and I didn't go to school for that, you know?</p>
<p>Mostly I just tried to get the living room set up.</p>
<p>It took a little while to find a stud.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can, I can see that.</p>
<p>Maybe, uh, take another personal day tomorrow, huh?</p>
<p>You know, maybe I will take another run at that pool filter.</p>
<p>Maybe try and do all the other things that you tried to do today, but, uh, you know... do them.</p>

<p>Don't tell me about present weather...</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize we had company.</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis.</p>
<p>This is Jimmy-- he's the pool guy.</p>
<p>I invited him over for dinner.</p>
<p>Mac, can I speak to you in the foyer for a second?</p>
<p>Oh, uh... Sure. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Excuse us for a second.</p>
<p>Just be a... just be a... just be a quick minute here.</p>
<p>Hey. What?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Come on, man. You gonna invite some guy over to my house that I don't even know.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I just wanted to have, uh, somebody over for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: So I got to have dinner with some guy, "Hey, pool guy."</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: His name is Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Jimmy? I don't give a fuck what you do.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You could ask him about all sorts of things. I mean...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: What do you want me to ask pool guy?</p>
<p>If he knew shit that I was interested in, he wouldn't be a fucking pool guy.</p>
<p>I said I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. No, I'm just, uh... (chuckles)</p>
<p>I'm just confused, you know, I...</p>
<p>Here I am thinking that we got a pool that's outside.</p>
<p>Eh... I didn't realize that we had an indoor pool.</p>
<p>Can we just forget about it and eat our dinner?</p>
<p>It's just so funny.</p>
<p>We got enough money for two pools.</p>
<p>And yet we don't have enough money for a recipe book, 'cause here we are eating mac and cheese again.</p>
<p>You don't know how hard it is to be cooped up in here all by myself, okay?</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>At least you get to go to work.</p>
<p>I "get to go to work"?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, everybody, hey, I get to go to work.</p>
<p>I "get" to have a job.</p>
<p>I "get" to have to make money for us.</p>
<p>Oh, my... You know what, screw this.</p>
<p>Wh... Oh, oh, yes.</p>
<p>Fine, just walk away right in the middle...</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>(thudding)</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Aah.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>What...?</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>The hell you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, do you hear it, too?</p>
<p>I heard you bashing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that chirping?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's a cricket.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, I'm gonna say something here, and it might not be popular, but...</p>
<p>I hate this place.</p>
<p>And I got to get back to the city.</p>
<p>I'm going nuts.</p>
<p>I miss the city, too.</p>
<p>I miss the action.</p>
<p>You know, I thought this place would soften my edges, but they're sharper than ever.</p>
<p>Dude, I cannot be cooped up here.</p>
<p>You know, cooking and cleaning and fixing.</p>
<p>All right, all right, calm down, calm down.</p>
<p>I... I think I have an idea.</p>
<p>L-Let's... let's invite the gang over.</p>
<p>You know, we'll clean up the place, we'll serve 'em a nice dinner, we'll show 'em how-how well we're doing, and I'll feel Frank out about this bet, you know, which in retrospect is completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>How are they gonna find an old man that's gonna go along with this?</p>
<p>Right. Exactly. (chuckles)</p>
<p>(doorbell rings)</p>
<p>Mac and Dennis, old man.</p>
<p>Old man, Mac and Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Ah...</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: So, uh, what's with the hats?</p>
<p>(Frank and Charlie laugh)</p>
<p>I... You wouldn't get it. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you kind of had to be there, man.</p>
<p>Hey, how about that food, huh?</p>
<p>Mac calls it "Mac's famous mac and cheese."</p>
<p>And it is famous.</p>
<p>In my stomach. (laughs)</p>
<p>We're your friends, and I've never heard of it.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>We are having so much fun at this house.</p>
<p>I'll tell you, I can't believe we ever lived anywhere else.</p>
<p>But I was just curious, if we were to lose this bet, what would the logistics be, like, with the old man thing?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.</p>
<p>If you guys are cracking, you can forfeit now, I'll buy the three of youse a California king-size bed to sleep in.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: What?!</p>
<p>No, they're not gonna forfeit-- this place is rad.</p>
<p>You want a little side action?</p>
<p>No, no, no, don't muddy this with side action.</p>
<p>Dee, don't do it.</p>
<p>I'll take some side action.</p>
<p>No... (huffs)</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>How about if they win, I'll take that California king bed for myself.</p>
<p>Fine, and if they lose, the three of you got to sleep with the old man.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I have to piss.</p>
<p>Out of my penis.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, well, clearly Mac wants to speak to me in secret.</p>
<p>Uh, so excuse me.</p>
<p>Wha...?</p>
<p>Oh, good, you got my signal.</p>
<p>Yeah, got your signal.</p>
<p>Dude, we're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it.</p>
<p>Yeah, dude, it's cool, man.</p>
<p>W-We'll figure it out. It's...</p>
<p>No, no, it's not cool.</p>
<p>There's no way we're gonna make it.</p>
<p>And also, dude, what's with the hats?</p>
<p>What is with those hats?!</p>
<p>Dennis, I got to know.</p>
<p>They told me the story, and it didn't make sense, and now we can't get it out of them.</p>
<p>Look, dude, I don't want to sound racist, but can we just discuss the fact that it's an old black man?</p>
<p>Yeah, mmm.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be an old man.</p>
<p>Just an old man.</p>
<p>Now it's a black man.</p>
<p>Dude, that's, like, a whole other thing. That's two things.</p>
<p>That's two things, it's two things.</p>
<p>All right, you know what, let's...</p>
<p>Maybe we just... we-we just... we take the California king.</p>
<p>I mean, that's a big bed.</p>
<p>You want to share the bed with an old black man?</p>
<p>No, of course not, I...</p>
<p>All right, that sounded racist.</p>
<p>I don't want to share a bed with an old man.</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's a big bed, and we could probably work it out.</p>
<p>Okay, so picture big bed, big bed.</p>
<p>Me on the side, you know, you right here.</p>
<p>Old man, right here.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Why am I in the middle? Black man should be in the middle.</p>
<p>Don't call him "black man."</p>
<p>His name's not "black man."</p>
<p>His name's "old man."</p>
<p>Let's stick with "old man."</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just sounds better.</p>
<p>All right, so how about this?</p>
<p>You and I on the big bed, side-by-side, black man, he's...</p>
<p>Now you got me doing it.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Old man is down at the bottom, sideways, like a dog.</p>
<p>Are you calling black people dogs?</p>
<p>No, that's not what I...</p>
<p>That's very racist.</p>
<p>What the hell is going...? (gasps)</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You guys are cracking, aren't you? (scoffs)</p>
<p>Nah, it's-it's, like... fine. Nah, it's fine.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>It's soul-crushing, Dee. - Oh, my God, I can't make this house into a home.</p>
<p>I didn't go to school for that.</p>
<p>He didn't go to school for it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, why did you let me take the side action?!</p>
<p>I told you not to take the side action!</p>
<p>You bitch. You bitch.</p>
<p>Why didn't you yell it so I could hear it?</p>
<p>I'm tired of yelling.</p>
<p>Damn it. Now we got to figure out where Dee goes in the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, right, Dee's got to be in the bed.</p>
<p>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I'll tell you exactly where Dee goes, okay?</p>
<p>Dee goes right in the goddamn middle of her brand-new California king-size bed all by herself.</p>
<p>How are we even having this conversation?!</p>
<p>All you boys have to do...</p>
<p>Guys, all you got to do to win is just exist.</p>
<p>Hey, morning, buddy.</p>
<p>You're up early.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm up early, and I'm feeling great.</p>
<p>You know, I was thinking about it, and Dee was right.</p>
<p>All we have to do is exist here for the next couple weeks, and we win this bet.</p>
<p>So... check this out.</p>
<p>I made you that.</p>
<p>"Mac's Honey Do List"?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That is a list of chores to give you a sense of purpose, so you don't feel so cooped up and lonely.</p>
<p>How's a list of chores going to make me feel less lonely?</p>
<p>Well, check out chore number one.</p>
<p>"Name the dog."</p>
<p>Well, that's so stupid.</p>
<p>I don't have a dog.</p>
<p>You sure about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, positive.</p>
<p>I don't have a dog.</p>
<p>I mean, I had Poppins, but he's gone.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>I don't have a dog.</p>
<p>What do you mean, am I sure?</p>
<p>Of course I'm sure.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be so sure.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>What... are you okay?</p>
<p>Look behind you, asshole.</p>
<p>Oh. (gasps)</p>
<p>You got me a dog?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, he's so cute.</p>
<p>I mean, he's no Poppins, but...</p>
<p>Yeah, he's a lot better than Poppins, trust me.</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'm gonna name him Dennis.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You're Dennis.</p>
<p>He's Dennis Jr.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Um, but sure, yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p>Hey, so why don't you go ahead and cross number one off the list there?</p>
<p>See how it feels.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, what's a-a couple weeks between two best friends, right?</p>
<p>It's whatever we make of it.</p>
<p>So why don't we agree right now to make these next few weeks the best of our lives?</p>
<p>You with me, buddy?</p>
<p>I'm with you.</p>
<p>I'm gonna raise this guy like he was our own son.</p>
<p>Okay. (laughing)</p>

<p>You ever been in a storm, Wally?</p>
<p>I mean, a real storm?</p>
<p>Not a thunderstorm, but a storm of fists raining down on your head.</p>
<p>Blasting you in the face.</p>
<p>Pummeling you in the stomach.</p>
<p>Hitting you in the chest so hard you think your heart's gonna stop.</p>
<p>You ever been in a storm like that, Wally?</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Dennis.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>You okay, dude?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who you talking to?</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Dog grave.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Anything exciting happen at work today?</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Well, I called up there.</p>
<p>They... they said you weren't even there.</p>
<p>Can we not talk about my day?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can talk about my day.</p>
<p>And how was your day?</p>
<p>Not great.</p>
<p>You know, with the dog dying and all, but... somehow, old Mac pulled it together.</p>
<p>He cooked for you, and he cleaned for you.</p>
<p>In fact, Dennis, everything I do, I do for you.</p>
<p>What are you talking about, man?</p>
<p>I'm talking about everything I do, I do for you!</p>
<p>And everything you do, you do for yourself!</p>
<p>Sleeping in your car.</p>
<p>Eating at Applebee's.</p>
<p>Were you spying on me?</p>
<p>Oh, don't you turn this around on me.</p>
<p>All you do is think about yourself!</p>
<p>You didn't even notice that I switched up the mac and cheese.</p>
<p>Is that what this is about?</p>
<p>The goddamn mac and cheese?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I noticed!</p>
<p>You put meat hunks in it!</p>
<p>Wow! Hunks of meat!</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Well, of course Dennis would like Dennis.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's Dennis!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You're eating the dog!</p>
<p>(laughing wildly)</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, God! What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>I don't know! I guess it was just a cry for attention.</p>
<p>You didn't even blink twice when I told you that the dog was dead.</p>
<p>I can't live with you anymore in this goddamn place.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go stay in a hotel.</p>
<p>Where's my suitcase, Mac?</p>
<p>Wait. Wait, wait.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis...</p>
<p>Tell me about Mac's famous mac and cheese.</p>
<p>Okay, I can explain.</p>
<p>I called it my famous mac and cheese as-as a joke.</p>
<p>But then it seemed like you like it.</p>
<p>You like that it was Mac's famous mac and cheese.</p>
<p>And so I just kept saying it.</p>
<p>You're pathetic.</p>
<p>You're the one that's sitting at Applebee's eating pot stickers all by yourself.</p>
<p>You're the one that's pathetic.</p>
<p>(doorbell rings)</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, that must be nosy Wally.</p>
<p>Coming to see what all the fighting's about.</p>
<p>Well... why don't we show him what all the fighting's about?</p>
<p>Why don't we show him right now?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, calm down.</p>
<p>Don't you tell me to calm down.</p>
<p>(smoke alarm chirps)</p>
<p>There's that chirping again.</p>
<p>How are you not hearing that?</p>
<p>News flash, asshole!</p>
<p>I've been hearing it the entire goddamn time!</p>
<p>Then why wouldn't you say something?!</p>
<p>Because I hate you!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>(whooping)</p>

<p>Look at this!</p>
<p>Huh? We did what?</p>
