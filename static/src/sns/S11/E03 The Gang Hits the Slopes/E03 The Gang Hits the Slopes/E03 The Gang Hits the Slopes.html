<p>The mountain is ours, Frank!</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Uh... not exactly.</p>
<p>Uh... actually, uh... the whole Snow Palace thing was, uh, all for show.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I needed to distract the local environmentalist groups while I fracked the mountain.</p>
<p>Wh-Wh... What?!</p>
<p>You fracked the mountain?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, the banquet, the race-- it was all set up.</p>
<p>It was just a diversion, it was... a distraction, because I wanted to get into this hill and suck out its natural resources.</p>
<p>So all this here was just one big setup?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I hired the hooker, so you could rip their tops off.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Oh... That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>
<p>I'm good. You want to... you want to stick around, it's okay. No.</p>
<p>It'd be good to go back to Philly, right? I mean...</p>
<p>I'm pretty tired.</p>
<p>It was quite a weekend.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't even like skiing that much.</p>
<p>(groaning): I-I need to go see a doctor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I should probably see a doctor, too, actually, I guess, if Tatiana was a hooker.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, God, gross. Yeah.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p><strong>Man (over P.A.)</strong>: Well, folks, you heard it.</p>
<p>Frank fracked the mountain, and it looks like we'll all be out of jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh... God!</p>
<p>So, did you even hire<em> that</em> guy?</p>
<p>You know, Charlie, I have no idea who that guy is.</p>
<p>Huh. I guess some things really are different on the mountain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
