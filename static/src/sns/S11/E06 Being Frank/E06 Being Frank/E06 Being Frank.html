<p>Eh, eh. Eh.</p>
<p>Mm, mm. Mm.</p>
<p>Still got it.</p>
<p>All righty, here we go. See what we're getting into today.</p>
<p>It's only a backup. You're gonna be fine.</p>
<p>If everybody sticks to the tasks that I've carefully tailored for each of you, then you're gonna be great.</p>
<p>Everything's gonna work out.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em> Oh, shit!</em></p>
<p>Frank, do you know what's happening?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>Mm, play it cool, play it cool.</em></p>
<p>Ah, Dennis, I know what's happening.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>My God. -So what?</p>
<p>Well, if we were just asking if everybody knows what's going on, I just want to say that I do.</p>
<p>I wasn't asking.</p>
<p>We're not. He didn't. That's not what's going on.</p>
<p>He didn't ask that. That's not the thing.</p>
<p>I wasn't. All right, you know what?</p>
<p>Let's just... let's go over the blueprint, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, the blueprint. I want everybody to map out their positions. Specifically...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>All right, here's your chance to catch up. Look at the blueprint. Listen to the vain one. He knows the deal. What's his name again? Is it Damon? No. Delroy. No. DeMarcus. Why can't I think of his name today? Shoot! I think he just explained the plan!</em></p>
<p>So I think we're good.</p>
<p>Yeah. Frank, you ready to run us all through it again?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>shit. Deflect! Deflect!</em></p>
<p>Shut up, bird!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Don't ask him to run us back through it.</p>

<p>Where you going, man?</p>
<p>You got to stay back here on the walkie in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, emergency.</p>
<p>Right, okay, and you have your walkie, right?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: <em>No.</em></p>
