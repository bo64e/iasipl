<p><strong>Dennis</strong>:<em> Uh... I feel like you guys should have, like, dressed up a little bit for this.</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>:<em> No, no, it sends the wrong image, you know?</em></p>
<p>Uh, we're not selling a game for squares, we're selling a game for, like, everyday people like us, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, that's a good point.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.</p>
<p>You will never guess what happened. Okay.</p>
<p>So this guy comes in, right?</p>
<p>We think he's just a regular customer.</p>
<p>We start chatting him up.</p>
<p>Turns out, he's an executive at Mattel.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, so of course we start talking to him about Chardee MacDennis, and he seemed totally into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's coming by today, man.</p>
<p>We're gonna pitch it to him.</p>
<p>Maybe we could, uh, work in some of the ideas I've been suggesting.</p>
<p>Those aren't "ideas" as much as they are... random acts of violence.</p>
<p>Well, you see, when I was a kid, games were much more violent.</p>
<p>I mean, we used to play "Purple Nurple," "Sock Full of Quarters," "Kick the Jew"...</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: No, why don't you try winning one time?</p>
<p>And then you can start throwing in new rules.</p>
<p>How about we just change the name of the game then?</p>
<p>"Franken MacChardeeden."</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: What? That's terrible.</p>
<p>First of all, your name isn't "Franken."</p>
<p>Secondly, Chardee MacDennis is just a working title.</p>
<p>Technically, we're still in arbitration.</p>
<p>Last we left it, Dee had filibustered, and Charlie had a motion pending.</p>
<p>And I will not yield to the gentleman.</p>
<p>'Cause you have no honor, you goddamn bitch.</p>
<p>You have no honor!</p>
<p>You see what I'm talking about-- it's a whole thing, Frank.</p>
<p>Then let's call it "Chardee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo."</p>
<p>What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>What made you just think of that?</p>
<p>It's not a break-dancing competition.</p>
<p>There's no electricity involved.</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Uh-uh-uh-uh.</p>
<p>Hey, there, how's it going, uh... Andy was it?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Ah, Andy, I want you to meet Frank.</p>
<p>Frank, uh, meet Andy from Mattel.</p>
<p>Hello, hello.</p>
<p>I got to tell ya-- I'm pretty excited.</p>
<p>Adult game play is a fast-rising market, and we are always on the lookout for something a little out of the box.</p>
<p>Oh, we-we can help you there, bud.</p>
<p>That's great. Now, what was the name of the game again?</p>
<p>Chardee MacDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo.</p>
<p>Okay, Andy, you're gonna like this video we made for you.</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>(Charlie shouts indistinctly)</p>
<p>(echoing): Chardee MacDennis.</p>
<p>Chardee MacDennis is all your favorite games rolled into one: <em>Mouse Trap, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry...</em></p>
<p>But it's not exactly like those things.</p>
<p>It's also like Boggle, Wheel of Fortune, Risk.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: <em>Chardee MacDennis!</em></p>
<p>What other games do you like?</p>
<p>It's like those other games too!</p>
<p>But more better.</p>
<p>And different enough legally.</p>
<p>I'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>I'm a lawyer in this part.</p>
<p>We're like Moby... remix!</p>
<p>(air horn blares)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: <em>Ch-Ch-Chardee MacDennis!</em></p>
<p>Regular board games should be called...</p>
<p>"I'm bored... games"</p>
<p>I don't get that one.</p>
<p>I... No, I told you not to... Stay out of my peripheral...</p>
<p>Do you want a game that lulls you into a sense of security, <em>but surprises you with constant rule changes?</em></p>
<p>Then you want the game of games...</p>
<p>Back... back up.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Man (thundering)</strong>: <em>Chardee MacDennis!</em></p>
<p>We always win. And they always lose.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What are you guys doing over there?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>(static hissing)</p>
<p>W-Why'd you put that in?</p>
<p>Yeah, what was that?</p>
<p>Factually accurate.</p>
<p>So, Andy, what did you think?</p>
<p>I... got to say, it's a little confusing.</p>
<p>Uh, can't we just play the game?</p>
<p>Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, we tend to get a little competitive when we play.</p>
<p>You know, we're not exactly a mellow bunch.</p>
<p>Right. That'll be fun.</p>
<p>Plus, that's the best way for me to understand the game.</p>
<p>But that's what...why you would understand...</p>
<p>Yeah, that's why we did that.</p>
<p>Okay, let me confer with my associates for a minute.</p>
<p>Why don't you grab a drink?</p>
<p>It's o-on the house, of course.</p>
<p>Um, guys, can we talk?</p>
<p>Uh, cool, man.</p>
<p>I think we can probably, um...</p>
<p>We can't...</p>
<p>No, no, no... no, no, I-I think we can.</p>
<p>Uh, we can do this, guys.</p>
<p>We just got to be... just got to make it fun.</p>
<p>You know what we have to do?</p>
<p>Is we have to not care about who wins. Just for this time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That'll help. That will help.</p>
<p>We just have to sell the game.</p>
<p>Just sell it. Okay. We can do it.</p>
<p>All right, so, Frank, you'll be on Andy's team.</p>
<p>Wait, don't stick me with him. He-he doesn't know the goddamn rules.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get crushed again.</p>
<p>Shut up, Frank, just...</p>
<p>Shut up. Shut up. It's not about winning or losing.</p>
<p>Exactly. It doesn't matter. It's fun.</p>
<p>We're not gonna care...</p>
<p>It's fun.</p>
<p>So we'll just... we'll keep our emotions in check.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Just be like: (exhales)</p>
<p>(all exhaling)</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>(exhaling continues)</p>
<p>Gentlemen, good luck to you.</p>
<p>And to yous. And to yous all.</p>
<p>This is nice-- a little role playing.</p>
<p>Very big in gaming right now.</p>
<p>This also celebrates sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed. Yeah, well, you're totally getting it.</p>
<p>You're catching on.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, there used to be a couple rules about not cursing and not asking questions in certain rounds, but I think we should do away with that, for now, because it's your first time playing and, guys, we don't want anybody blacking out.</p>
<p>Yeah, no problem. Right, that's fine.</p>
<p>I think that'll be fine.</p>
<p>We're flexible.</p>
<p>It's a good idea.</p>
<p>Okay, are we ready?</p>
<p>Three, two, one.</p>
<p>Gentlemen... suck my dick.</p>
<p>(shouting gibberish)</p>
<p>Hut, hut, hut.</p>
<p>(playing bugle)</p>
<p>What the hell's going on?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, this is our flag-raising ceremony.</p>
<p>Yeah, we used to do the Maori war dance, but that-that got us a little too riled up.</p>
<p>Either way, this is all about intimidation and showing off your prowess.</p>
<p>Uh, think of it like the Indian-Pakistani border ceremony that they do over there.</p>
<p>Now, this is Mac and Charlie's flag, which, as you can see, is fairly badly burned.</p>
<p>Not only does the winner get to stomp the loser's game pieces, but they also get to burn their flag up.</p>
<p>Now, you'll notice that the Golden Geese flag is unsullied.</p>
<p>You'll also notice that Mac and Charlie's flag is just a little weird, and that's because their original name was the Thundercats, uh... but they were confused by that.</p>
<p>Well, 'cause we're not cats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're not cats.</p>
<p>So, then, how could we...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Even though it's the name they chose.</p>
<p>So they went with the Thundermen.</p>
<p>(playing quavering note)</p>
<p>This brings us to Frank's flag, which is, uh... yeah, it's just unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: It's four Fs.</p>
<p>I didn't know it was gonna come off like that.</p>
<p>Pretty sure you did.</p>
<p>(playing rousing tune)</p>
<p>Okay, Andy, Level 1 is Trivia, Puzzles and Artistry.</p>
<p>The first team to get three points moves their game piece to the next level.</p>
<p>All right. Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What Philly celebrity would you most want to have a drink with? Oh, shit, okay, yeah, you know what-- a lot of the questions are opinion-based. Heads up.</p>
<p>Ah. Okay... I-I see.</p>
<p>Uh, all right, this is, uh, let me guess. Um...</p>
<p>Oh: Dr. J.</p>
<p>That's not it! All right, all right.</p>
<p>Play it cool, play it cool.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right. That is wrong, though. You wouldn't want to have a drink with him.</p>
<p>Dee, chance to steal.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby. Yes! All right.</p>
<p>Point for us.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions are outdated.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, they are a little outdated.</p>
<p>Okay, our turn, our turn.</p>
<p>Um, artistry. And it's an all-play, guys.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>All right, now, a member of each team must make this clue out of clay while the other member tries to guess what it is.</p>
<p>Okay, uh, penis.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Uh, lip-penis.</p>
<p>What? No, look, look.</p>
<p>Oh, hard penis.</p>
<p>A hard clay penis.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Gargoyle inside.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>It's a-a, okay, a chopped-off head, a decapitat... uh, head in a box!</p>
<p>Dee, I'm gonna put your head in a box if you don't start getting the answer right.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>A heart, it's a heart!</p>
<p>Uh, it's, uh... it's, uh, love!</p>
<p>Love!</p>
<p>Oh! He got it! Was that it?</p>
<p>(whoops)</p>
<p>Get another card. How do you make a heart?</p>
<p>If the... Love?</p>
<p>Yeah, because I was making, uh, Cupid's arrow, dude.</p>
<p>Well, why does it have a big vein running through it?</p>
<p>Because that's the streak as it flies through the air.</p>
<p>Come... At least I didn't put a woman's head in a box.</p>
<p>This is not a woman's head in a box, you sick freak.</p>
<p>This is a woman's head in a freezer.</p>
<p>And it's supposed to represent the preservation of love forever and ever.</p>
<p>Whatever, dude. It's our turn, it's our turn. We go.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: No puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles, no puzzles no puzzles, no puzzles...</p>
<p>Puzzles.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Put this bottle back together.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that's interesting.</p>
<p>What bottle?</p>
<p>This one.</p>
<p>Now just be very, very careful.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Final touches, final touches.</p>
<p>Watch that blue string-- don't pull it apart.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. All right.</p>
<p>Ready, ready?</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay... okay.</p>
<p>Okay, very... Very careful.</p>
<p>Very, very careful.</p>
<p>It held.</p>
<p>It held!</p>
<p>It held! Just swallowed a little glass, but it held, man!</p>
<p>You see, that's what I'm talking about-- you sacrifice, you put the work in...</p>
<p>That's right! you earn that card.</p>
<p>We're catching up to 'em.</p>
<p>Hey... Okay, it's our turn, then.</p>
<p>Dennis and Dee skip right to Level 2.</p>
<p>Yes, yes! Aw... Aw...</p>
<p>Face, face!</p>
<p>(squawks)</p>
<p>Due to some alcohol-related cheating, we decided to incorporate I.V.'s to keep everything on the up-and-up.</p>
<p>You guys were the ones that were cheating.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, I feel like Andy has to have one of these.</p>
<p>Well, Andy's our guest.</p>
<p>We don't want to be poking him with needles.</p>
<p>Unfair, unfair!</p>
<p>Yeah, unfair, unfair, unfair.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, as you can see, Mac and Charlie are a little worked up about never having won the game. Ever.</p>
<p>I'm a little concerned about the safety of this.</p>
<p>The... Why... Oh, oh, If it were beer?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no-- we're mainlining wine.</p>
<p>It's not beer. We switched Level 2 to wine because you can't mainline beer because it's got bubbles in it and shit.</p>
<p>We tried-- it was bad.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's safe for people to put those beverages directly in... Time!</p>
<p>(blasting note)</p>
<p>(gasps) Oh! (grunts)</p>
<p>Okay, Andy, welcome to Round 2 (Body): Physical Challenge, Pain and Endurance.</p>
<p>Okay, now, we've added a new challenge to Level 2-- this is, this is really exciting.</p>
<p>So what you do-- you spin the globe, you point your finger.</p>
<p>Wherever your finger lands, you have to speak in the accent of that region for the rest of the round, otherwise, you gotta drink.</p>
<p>That sounds fun.</p>
<p>That's a great idea.</p>
<p>Isn't that good?</p>
<p>Isn't that good?</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Uh... ha!</p>
<p>Russia!</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so I got it.</p>
<p>I guess I...</p>
<p>(Russian accent): I guess I got to do that?</p>
<p>Huh? (Russian accent): You do Russia.</p>
<p>Hey, look at Andy, look at Andy.</p>
<p>Okay, let's see...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p>"Brasial."</p>
<p>No, Brazil.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Wh-What's the accent of Brazil?</p>
<p>It's a-it's a country in South America-- why don't we say any Latin American accent'll do?</p>
<p>Any Latin American? Okay.</p>
<p>(bad Mexican accent): Okay, homie. Uh... <em>Hola, le homes.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, man. Nachos.</p>
<p>Oh, real racist with it, huh? Yeah, that is extremely racist-- and by the way, that's more of a Los Angeles sort of Mexican cholo vibe.</p>
<p>Let's go... let's go see the Dodgers play the Lakers. Low rider.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, Dee, you want to spin for us?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Oh! Ah, would you look at that-- Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That shouldn't be on there.</p>
<p>You barely spinned it, homes.</p>
<p>That's bullshit, man.</p>
<p>(Philadelphia accent): Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Looks like the tide's turned.</p>
<p>Yeah, looks like we got an advantage over yous guys, huh, Den?</p>
<p>(with accent): What is going on?</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>My Philly accent.</p>
<p>Wow, that's not even close.</p>
<p>Drink, homes.</p>
<p>Ow! Okay, slower.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Physical challenge.</p>
<p>And this one's an all-play.</p>
<p>Oh! Hey! Okay, everybody.</p>
<p>This is good. We like...</p>
<p>Hands on a bird body!</p>
<p>(groans) A member from each team must try and keep their hand on Dee's bony body for as long as they can.</p>
<p>(groans) Dis is shit. Dis is not good.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>(exhales through teeth)</p>
<p>Hang in there, homes. I can't do it, "mang." I can't do it.</p>
<p>You barely even put your hand on there already.</p>
<p>Hang in there, man.</p>
<p>I know, but...</p>
<p>Ah! I can't do it, I can't do it!</p>
<p>Oh! Ha!</p>
<p>Mac, that's crazy!</p>
<p>Ay, ay, ay!</p>
<p>Mac and Charlie are out!</p>
<p>Hey, why'd you do that?</p>
<p>I couldn't do it!</p>
<p>Ay, ay, ay!</p>
<p>Oh, violation!</p>
<p>That's not L.A. Mexican.</p>
<p>That's, like, Cartoon Mexican.</p>
<p>We barely even switched it, homie.</p>
<p>No, I don't know.</p>
<p>I'll have a drink, all right?</p>
<p>You got to drink, too.</p>
<p>Oh... (Middle Eastern accent): What is so hard about keeping one hand on this woman?</p>
<p>She's a very pleasant woman.</p>
<p>She's a very, very pretty woman.</p>
<p>Ugh. Don't sexualize her, dude.</p>
<p>This is bad enough as it is.</p>
<p>(Germanic accent): Vhat is the matter, Dennis?</p>
<p>Vhy are you zo uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Because the closeness of your hand to her breast...</p>
<p>Stop. Yeah, stop. ...which is making you want to have sex with her?</p>
<p>Don't, don't... oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Ugh! Oh... Oh!</p>
<p>(gasps) Wait, what's... what's going on?</p>
<p>You stupid idiot.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you glued your hand to her!</p>
<p>Cheater! Cheater! Cheater!</p>
<p>Oh, is that the accent drop?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, all accents are dropped the minute someone gets caught cheating. Yeah, yeah, we have to be able to break them in our native tongue to allow for maximum shame.</p>
<p>Shame, shame, shame...</p>
<p>Shame, shame...</p>
<p>(all shouting "Shame!")</p>
<p>So... so no more I.V.'s?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That's a Level 2 game.</p>
<p>You don't want to mainline liquor, buddy.</p>
<p>You don't want to do it.</p>
<p>Still a pretty stiff drink.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Things get ratcheted up in Level 3.</p>
<p>Then even get worse in Level 4.</p>
<p>There is no Level 4.</p>
<p>Yes, there is: Mind, body, spirit, horror.</p>
<p>Stop, Frank. Come on.</p>
<p>There's no horror level.</p>
<p>Look, Andy, his ideas don't represent the game.</p>
<p>They don't represent us.</p>
<p>Okay, pick a card now...</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>shits and Ladders.</p>
<p>Oh! (chuckles)</p>
<p>Sort of a play on<em> Chutes and Ladders.</em></p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Each member must take a laxative and get on a ladder.</p>
<p>The one who can hold it in the longest wins. FRANK: Love this one.</p>
<p>Also known as Shoots and Splatters.</p>
<p>Poops and Bladders!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Andy!</p>
<p>I'll go get the laxatives.</p>
<p>All right, All right.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p>Strongest stuff on the market.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Mm. Oh, that's strong.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>Okay, to the ladders!</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>I'm already feeling a twinge. (yawns)</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I feel something.</p>
<p>I don't feel like I have to poop, though.</p>
<p>I feel weird. I kind of feel crazy. Like, what is that?</p>
<p>That isn't a laxative, is it, Frank?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Welcome to Level 4, (echoing): horror.</p>
<p>(distorted laughter)</p>
<p>Oh. What is this?</p>
<p>Wake up, guys. Wake up.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hello, gang.</p>
<p>The keys to your cuffs have been sewn into your forearm.</p>
<p>Beside you are some tweezers attached to a car battery.</p>
<p>Last team out of the room loses.</p>
<p>Frank, this is insane.</p>
<p>Let us out of here!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Everything has to be based on an existing board game!</p>
<p>That's the whole thing!</p>
<p>Oh, but it is, Dennis.</p>
<p>Ever hear of a game called...</p>
<p><em>Operation?</em> (cackles)</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>He's got a point.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(zapping)</p>
<p>(shouting)</p>
<p>(zapping continues)</p>
<p>This game is totally insane!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Don't give up on the game!</p>
<p>The game is fine! (groans)</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, this isn't representative of us...</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm gonna stop!</p>
<p>I'm gonna stop!</p>
<p>No, I quit, too. I quit.</p>
<p>I can't do it.</p>
<p>I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p>It's just the bone.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Charlie!</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ, dude! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh! I think you shit your pants, too.</p>
<p>Well, it was probably just the laxative kicking in. It wasn't a goddamn laxative, Charlie!</p>
<p>You just pooped your pants!</p>
<p>You guys quit! You quit and we won the game!</p>
<p>(grunts) Finally.</p>
<p>Finally, I won the game.</p>
<p>This is not what I signed up for, you donkey-brained maniac!</p>
<p>Uncuff me!</p>
<p>Cool it, cool it.</p>
<p>Take it easy. I mean, it's just a... it's just a simple mind game.</p>
<p>No one had a key on 'em.</p>
<p>You know, I knew they'd cave like bitches.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Andy, did you just call him "donkey-brained"?</p>
<p>Yeah. What? It's an expression.</p>
<p>What did you mean by "not what I signed up for"?</p>
<p>Do you two know each other?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>No. No. No.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait-- look at this, guys.</p>
<p>"Mattel" is spelled wrong on his business card. That says "Matel."</p>
<p>I'm calling this number.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p><strong>Frank (recorded)</strong>: Welcome to the home of Wolf Cola...</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>(shouting "Cheaters!")</p>
<p>Oh, okay, Frank, so you clearly just hired this guy so that you could win and put your stamp on the game!</p>
<p>No, there's no truth in that at all. No.</p>
<p>Tell 'em, Andy.</p>
<p>(door slams)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: What?!</p>
<p>It was all bullshit? It was just a hoax?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...</p>
<p>Unreal.</p>
<p>So, then, if this isn't about selling the game anymore...</p>
<p>Well, then it's about winning.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Public humiliation.</p>
<p>Are you ready, Charles?</p>
<p>(slurring): Yes... Okay, I'm-I'm in a sort of...</p>
<p>Dude, are you-you sure you're okay?</p>
<p>You might've lost a lot of blood from digging around in there with the tweezers.</p>
<p>You know. He's around it. Yep.</p>
<p>Here we go. Okay, then here we go.</p>
<p>You have to withstand one full minute of intense berating.</p>
<p>Okay, that's, uh, lights on.</p>
<p>He's ready. "Lights on," he said.</p>
<p>"Lights on." Okay.</p>
<p>But it's not gonna be from us.</p>
<p>Nope. Not from us.</p>
<p>It's from<em> her!</em></p>
<p>Ow! Ow! You're holding my hair!</p>
<p>Okay, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Ow, let go! Oh, my God, that hurt so much!</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you know what, it was supposed to be a big reveal.</p>
<p>I had a whole thing planned.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>You know what, of course you ruined it-- you are the worst.</p>
<p><strong>The waitress</strong>: Oh, my God, what is that smell?</p>
<p>Is that poop? Did you poop in your pants, Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, gross.</p>
<p>That's so disgusting.</p>
<p>This is gonna be so easy.</p>
<p>No, dude, don't listen to them, okay?</p>
<p>(sniffles) You can do this, Charlie.</p>
<p>If you can not cry for just one minute, just one minute, we win the goddamn game.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>You can do this.</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(grunts) Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>All right. Okay. Okay. Here we go.</p>
<p>I can do...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Ready, get set, go.</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly, I have been waiting for this for a long time, you poop-smelling (distorted): trash person.</p>
<p>Your face, it looks like a troll!</p>
<p>You look like you have troll features!</p>
<p>You stalked me! There's something wrong with you!</p>
<p>Your brain is broken!</p>
<p>I hate you!</p>
<p>I hope you die! And I hope you go to hell!</p>
<p>Three! Two!</p>
<p>And I hope it burns!</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>(distorted shouting)</p>
<p>You did it! You did it!</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>We won! (shouts happily)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>:<em> Charlie?</em> DEE: <em>Come on, buddy, you can do it.</em></p>
<p>Come on, wake up, Charlie, wake up.</p>
<p>I don't know if he's gonna wake up.</p>
<p>I don't either.</p>
<p>Charlie, come on, buddy.</p>
<p>Charlie, are you okay? Charlie...</p>
<p>Charlie, open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Charlie? Oh. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. There he is.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>We thought we lost you, buddy.</p>
<p>We thought we lost you.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Oh, man. What happened?</p>
<p>God... like, all I remember is, like, winning the game and then passing out.</p>
<p>Is that how you remember it?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>No. No, no, you cried like a baby.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much right when the waitress started talking, you cried like a little bitch.</p>
<p>Quite a bit.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You-you must have been hallucinating from all the blood poisoning.</p>
<p>So... did you guys win?</p>
<p>Yeah. Big-time.</p>
<p>We always do.</p>
<p>So did you crush our game pieces?</p>
<p>No. Oh, my God, Charlie, no.</p>
<p>Charlie, we weren't even thinking about the game anymore.</p>
<p>No one was.</p>
<p>We were terrified for you.</p>
<p>With you in that condition?</p>
<p>Really? Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you so much, guys.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>That's, like, really, the nicest thing you've ever done.</p>
<p>Uh, Dee, can you...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(sighs) Charlie, no, we wouldn't have done that with you... with you in that condition.</p>
<p>Yeah. It-it...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But now that you're conscious, you know...</p>
<p>Dee, are you, uh, all set back there?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Loser. Yeah!</p>
<p>(both taunting, screeching)</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>(both honking)</p>
<p>Yeah! Yeah!</p>
