<p><strong>Frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Never saw it?</p>
<p>What are you guys looking at?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, new couches. We got rid of the old one, but the prices are insane.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's nuts, man.</p>
<p>I think we should just rent like we did the last time, you know?</p>
<p>Wait, you rented your sofa?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all we did was pay the interest.</p>
<p>How much was the interest?</p>
<p>Oh, it was nothing. It was like 25 bucks a week.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How long did you have it?</p>
<p>15 years, bro.</p>
<p>About 15 years, yeah.</p>

<p>That seems high.</p>
<p>That's pretty bad business, fellas.</p>
<p>I don't understand why prices are so high right now.</p>
<p>Inflation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, well, right.</p>
<p>Inflation, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, because of the inflation.</p>
<p>You guys do understand what inflation is, right?</p>
<p>Inflation? Yeah, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. For the sake of argument...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...pretend we don't.</p>
<p>Inflation is when the price of goods and services go up.</p>

<p>Charlie, we don't want to hear it. Frank, keep going.</p>
<p>Well, you see, the government tries to curb inflation by raising interest rates, so that people borrow less and spend less.</p>
<p>Okay, so if prices are going up, can we get a raise?</p>
<p>( <em>phone ringing</em> )</p>
<p>No, well, you see, if I raise your wages, then you'd have more money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that, in this case, is not good.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: No.</p>
<p>( <em>ringing stops</em> )</p>
<p>You know, it would increase inflation.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>And we don't want that to increase, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So maybe what we would need to do is lower our wages. I get it.</p>
<p>But that would cause a recession.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which could lead to a depression.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Plus, I brought my own nuts.</p>

<p>Consider it an offering.</p>
<p>Of war?</p>
<p>Of peace. What is going on with you, dude?</p>

<p>Mmm, some are from a tree, yes.</p>
<p>A fancy tree?</p>
<p>One of the fanciest, Mac.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>

<p>No. You can stay here one night, okay?</p>
<p>But I don't want to hear your goddamn business idea 'cause I don't care. Now tell us the Frank thing.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Frank only lent you guys the money 'cause he thinks you're gonna fail.</p>
<p>In fact, he wants you to fail.</p>
<p>See, he's what you would call a predatory lender, and he's simply taking advantage of you guys.</p>

<p>This is a classic inflation-interest play.</p>

<p>We got to go. We got work to do.</p>
<p>Just grab anything small.</p>
<p>Lamps are good 'cause they're easy to run with.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Are we robbing this place?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>You haven't paid your rent in three months, you deadbeat.</p>
<p>You can't come in here and take my shit.</p>
<p>Oh, you want it back? Well, then pay your rent.</p>
<p>I'm getting my gun.</p>
<p>Go for it, bitch! We got bulletproof vests on!</p>
<p>Oh, no, I don't. I don't have a bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>Relax, these guys are always bluffing. Grab stuff.</p>
<p>Frank, no. What is happening? You're a slumlord now?</p>
<p>Yes, I collect on these guys, and if they don't pay, I throw 'em out on the street, like I did you.</p>
<p>What? You're my landlord?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got tired of paying your rent all those years, so I bought the building.</p>
<p>Why did you raise the rent?</p>
<p>Inflation. I got to increase my nut.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Oh, he's hot.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Relax, they never shoot.</p>
<p>( <em>screams</em> )</p>
<p>Ah, time to go.</p>
<p>Pay your rent, you deadbeat.</p>
<p>Dennis, it's, like, I feel like we got to weigh all this stuff down, man.</p>
<p>Nah, it's fine, it's fine.</p>
<p>Also, I got to talk to you about this Internet money, dude, because this guy does not know what he's sitting on, man.</p>
<p>He's a chump, dude...</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie.</p>
<p>Stop trying to talk business, all right?</p>
<p>It's just not your strong suit, all right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, here comes a customer. Here, let me do the talking.</p>
<p>Hi, sir. Hi, how are you today?</p>
<p>It's a lovely day, isn't it?</p>
<p>A little windy.</p>
<p>A little breezy, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little breezy. But, uh, anyway, are you here to buy some furniture?</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, what if I told you you could get your furniture for free?</p>
<p>Yeah, see, times are very inflatable right now, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, stop, stop.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered owning an inflatable couch?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I don't have a pool, so...</p>
<p>A pool?</p>
<p>Yeah, for the...</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, I see, I see the confusion.</p>
<p>Oh-oh.</p>
<p>No, we're talking about for inside.</p>
<p>Yeah, inside your house.</p>
<p>Oh. What?</p>
<p>Like, how much do you currently rent your couch for?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I-I don't rent my couch.</p>
<p><strong>Mac ( <em>coughing</em> )</strong>: What?</p>
<p>( <em>wheezing</em> ): You pay full price for your couch?</p>
<p>That's outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p>( <em>horn honks</em> )</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, man, you have got to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Oh, and spend the remainder of our nut on medical bills?</p>
<p>I don't think so, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'll simply stop blowing up the furniture.</p>
<p>It is not the furniture, Mac. Okay? It is the nuts.</p>
<p>Dee, what the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Guys, I have information that will change the course of your company, and I will tell you what it is if you let me stay here.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, Charlie already tried that shit.</p>
<p>I did that move, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>wheezing</em> ): He, he did this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, Dee, why are you gluing your hand to the wall?</p>
<p>I mean, it's no way to solve a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, please, I have a solution to all of our problems, but you got to let me talk, okay?</p>
<p>Now, you guys are all completely over-leveraged, and that's the problem, right? My investment, this thing was only, like, ten dollars a unit, then it, like, dropped down to basically nothing, because it's a speculative market, right?</p>
<p>I'm making a bet that the SEC's not gonna regulate.</p>
<p>Of course, regulation's gonna come in at some point, it always does, but right now it's completely unregulated.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not talking about getting out over our skis, I'm just talking about making an investment tonight, turn it around tomorrow... We'll net double.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: That's money talk.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>That's money talk.</p>
<p>Where did you learn to talk like that?</p>
<p>Living with Frank, man. I've been trying to tell you that I'm picking up on this stuff. So, look, guys, let's pool all of our remaining nut together and turn it into a big pile of green, and then everybody gets a taste.</p>
<p>Okay, I didn't love the sound of that, but, uh...</p>
<p>Was it unclear? I was talking about, like, a huge pile of green, like, and everyone is, like...</p>
<p>Money talk?</p>
<p>...slurping that shit down.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, wow.</p>
<p>I've got a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, me, too.</p>
<p>Sure, sure. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Now, Charlie, did you take... all of my money...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>...and invest it in a box full of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Pies?</p>
<p>Yes. Very good, Dennis. Very good.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure you knew what they are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so these are, like, from 1991.</p>
<p>These are the original ones, right?</p>
<p>Super hard to find, super valuable.</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>Oh, dude, big time. Right? So, here's what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>Could we turn these around tonight and make a little profit? Sure, but I say we sit on them. Maybe we eat one or two.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I was worried about.</p>
<p>Well, you're not thinking big picture here.</p>
<p>No, I'm thinking big pic...</p>
<p>All right, loan's due.</p>
<p>First installment.</p>
<p>And I'm armed and I got a vest, so don't try nothing.</p>
<p>What do you got there?</p>
<p>1991's delicious cream-filled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Pies, fresh from the sewers to me.</p>
<p>Are they made from real turtle?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>How much you want for 'em?</p>
<p>They're not for sale, Frank.</p>
<p>Uh, mine... mine are for sale.</p>
<p>I own some of those, and mine are definitely for sale.</p>
<p>He has a very minimal share, Frank.</p>
<p>Ah. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Market dictates the value, Charlie.</p>
<p>Well... not when your demand is more than the supply.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll get 'em somewhere else.</p>
<p>Will you?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't think so, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh... uh-oh.</p>
<p>'Cause I bought the last remaining ones there are.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No...</p>
<p>Nice work.</p>
<p>And you kept it crypto.</p>
<p>You should have listened to me, Frank.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Name your price.</p>
<p>Board up that new room and the noisy toilet, forgive Mac and Dennis's loan, give Dee her apartment back, and return everything to the status quo.</p>
<p>That's too big a ask.</p>
<p>That's inflation, Frank.</p>
<p>You want the pies or not?</p>
<p>Fine. Done.</p>
<p>Good work, Charlie.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Frank.</p>
<p>( <em>gagging</em> )</p>
<p>I appreciate it. ( <em>gags</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>coughing, gagging</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Mac wheezing</em> )</p>
<p>Are you still eating the nuts?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Does he want to get to the hospital or to Costco?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Costco.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: He wants more nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Costco, yeah.</p>
<p>You know what, buddy? I think we'll take you to the hospital, and they'll have nuts, and you can... you can die there.</p>
<p>( <em>wheezes</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>trio chanting backwards</em> )</p>
