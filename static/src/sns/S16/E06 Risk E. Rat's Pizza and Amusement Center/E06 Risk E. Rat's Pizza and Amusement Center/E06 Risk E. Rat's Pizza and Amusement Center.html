<p>You guys remember that?</p>

<p>That's real, dude.</p>
<p>No, that was real, dude.</p>
<p>You saw them?</p>
<p>I saw 'em, I saw 'em.</p>

<p>That was the fir-first set of boobs I ever saw since my mom's, so...</p>
<p>Yeah. ( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>Do they still have that room where they paddle you if you're out of line?</p>
<p>Oh, no, uh, in our day they called it the Time-Out Room.</p>

<p>Fine.</p>
<p>As I was saying, I feel stupid talking about my feelings.</p>
<p>Like, I don't want to be in the Feelings Center.</p>
<p>That's not the point of Risk E. Rat's.</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>We are on the same page there 'cause, like, this isn't the point.</p>
<p>I don't want to be in the Feelings Center either, and, like, he's dead right about Risk E. Rat's.</p>
<p>That's the whole point of it.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>I feel I just want to go out there and have fun.</p>
<p>That's what I want to do, too.</p>
<p>I just want to play and have fun, and--</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Hey, here's the question about that, you guys.</p>
<p>Do we feel like we've earned that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, well, so do I.</p>
<p>Let's get out there and have some fun, shall we?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>We've only been here for like five minutes.</p>
<p>That's not a punishment. I-I don't feel punished.</p>
<p>Where-Where's the shame I'm supposed to be feeling?</p>
<p>There's no shame in making a mistake, Mac.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>How else would I know not to do it anymore?</p>
<p>Hey, listen, man. I'm a licensed psychotherapist.</p>
<p>You're a talking dog. I'm out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: Great.</p>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>I'm sure you are, Sam.</p>
<p>I'm sure you are.</p>
<p>'Cause you're a pussy.</p>
<p>Now, look, look, man, that's... that's not your fault.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, man.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. This dog, your parents, the whole, the whole culture is grooming you to be a pussy.</p>
<p>You got no freedom, which means you got no balls.</p>
<p>And then, even when you actually do get caught doing something bad, you're not held accountable.</p>
<p>And if you're not held accountable, you feel no guilt.</p>
<p>If you feel no guilt, you feel no shame.</p>
<p>If you got no shame... you're never gonna hate yourself enough to stop being bad and grow some balls.</p>
<p>You diddle this kid, you're definitely on camera.</p>
<p>I don't know if you want to be alone with him.</p>

<p>All right, this is the last piece.</p>
<p>( <em>scanner beeps</em> )</p>
<p>All right, what's it say?</p>
<p>"What does a nosy pepper do?"</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>"It gets jalapeño business."</p>
<p>That's stupid. Let me see it.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it! You know what it is?</p>
<p>You got to do it with an accent.</p>
<p>Uh, it gets "all-up-in-yo" business.</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Yeah, well, that's funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>'Cause that's Black.</p>
<p>That's Black.</p>
<p>Well, n-not necessarily, but it is sassy.</p>
<p>You just got to put some sass on there.</p>
<p>It also could be Mexican, I guess, 'cause of the jalapeño, that's a Mexican pepper.</p>
<p>Um, gets "hall-up-in-your" business, see?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that...</p>
<p>I get it, but I got to know who it's about.</p>
<p>I-I don't think it's about anybody.</p>
<p>I think it's just a-a play on words.</p>
<p>But I got to know who the victim is in order for me to laugh at them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll tell you what, in this scenario it's whites because white people are the only people who don't have the accent to pull off the joke.</p>
<p>Well, that's racist.</p>
<p>That is racist, and I don't appreciate it.</p>
<p>That's very racist.</p>
<p>I'll tell you that much right now.</p>
<p>Is this the satire you're talking about?</p>
<p>I don't know. If I'm being honest, I don't 100% understand what satire means.</p>
<p>Let's go through the jokes again.</p>

<p>What? Are you serious? They got rid of the bar?</p>
<p>There's no bar?</p>
