<p>Mm, can you switch mine to "Donna"?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well, well, well. Looks like the Frigid Bitches are going up against the Hanging Monster Dong Lucky Strike Chili Cheese Fryers.</p>
<p>Is that your name? That's really stupid.</p>
<p>It's too many ideas, man.</p>

<p>Hey, did Dee happen to tell you the history of her experience with bowling?</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>Okay, well, when she was a kid, she was, well, she was pretty decent.</p>
<p>And I got to say, she worked really, really hard at it.</p>
<p>So, she eventually became the captain of the girls' team.</p>
<p>Can you believe that?</p>
<p>Now, I'm no fan of women's sports.</p>
<p>Who is?</p>
<p>Yeah, they're not very popular.</p>
<p>Nobody is.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Nobody watches-- Especially women.</p>
<p>Women don't even like women's sports.</p>
<p>So I wouldn't have it.</p>
<p>And to prove that Dee's female mind was mentally weak, I started to go watch her, and I would say, "gutter ball" right before she rolled it, and wouldn't you know it, every time I said it, she'd roll a gutter ball.</p>
<p>Since then, if I even so much as look at Dee when she bowls, she can't knock down a single pin.</p>
<p>Not even one.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>

<p>What happened?</p>
<p>What the hell happened?</p>
<p>In the third act of my play, Donna rolls a gutter ball in the big match against her rival high school.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Can you knock it off with the play, please?</p>
<p>( <em>groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Ah, well, well, you done good, ladies.</p>
<p>Your little mind games-- they got you pretty far, but unfortunately... ( <em>grunts</em> ) ...still 11 points shy in the final frame.</p>
<p>Now, technically, I could pick up this spare and push the lead even further, and I... think we all know Dee's about to roll two gutter balls.</p>
<p>So I'll tell you what. Dee, if you would like, uh, you could just quit now and you could all admit that you're inferior in every single way, and we could just call it a night.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, dick?</p>
<p>I don't like your sister. She's a terrible person.</p>
