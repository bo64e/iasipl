<p>( <em>violin music playing</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>indistinct chatter</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Frank, would you like another buttered nipple?</p>
<p>No. The cream is making me gassy.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you have had four of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>both laugh</em> )</p>
<p>You know, we could order you something that's a little bit easier on the pipes.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I know what you're doing.</p>
<p>This is your annual "take me out and see if you can talk me into giving you more of my money."</p>
<p>Oh, stop.</p>
<p>Uh... Is he talking to us?</p>
<p>Give me money. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>We would never. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: And we just want you to have a fun night.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, get that.</p>
<p>What you working on there, bud?</p>
<p>I brought my own can of anchovies because the fish in this place is not salty enough.</p>
<p>Mm, that's...</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Got no taste.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis and Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I-I hear you.</p>
<p>It's, uh, it's not salty enough.</p>
<p>I want to point something out here to you, Frank.</p>
<p>I think we do a pretty good job of pretending like you're not an animal.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Is that thing loaded, by the way?</p>
<p>Nah, it's not loaded.</p>
<p>( <em>Dee sighs</em> )</p>
<p>And get off my back, huh?</p>
<p>Hey. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>You got it. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Got no intention to be riding on your back, pal.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: We like you just the way you are.</p>
<p>Mm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, maybe, just possibly, that entitles us to a little taste of your fortune after you die?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I-I...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I want to tell you something, I am not intending on dying anytime soon, so don't waste your breath.</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>You know what? Screw this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I... Dee, I told you this was a mistake.</p>
<p>No, I know, I know.</p>
<p>I... You know what? I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Couple of vultures picking at my carcass.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>You know, I am in the prime of my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think that you can...</p>
<p>( <em>gunshot</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis and Dee scream</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You shot us!</p>
<p>( <em>patrons murmuring</em> )</p>
<p>You shot us! I got shot in the face!</p>
<p>You said there were no bullets!</p>
<p>Okay, so it was loaded. My mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, don't be so dramatic.</p>
<p>I just nicked you.</p>
<p>It's not like anybody's in any real danger.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>I'm saying, don't shoot the whole balloon down, right?</p>
<p>Like, you-you pull it down...</p>
<p>Frank shot us.</p>
<p>He shot us in the face. We barely survived.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Wha...</p>
<p>Uh, no, not awesome.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. You came in all excited.</p>
<p>I thought you were bragging.</p>
<p>I was picking up on an excited energy, for sure.</p>
<p>Getting shot in the face and surviving is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>Listen, we got to get his gun away from him, okay?</p>
<p>I-I don't even care about the money anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, no, no, neither do I.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit about the money.</p>
<p>I mean, the man is a maniac, and he's gonna wind up shooting everyone in this bar.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I do care about the money, though.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, so do I. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's the only thing I care about. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on. You know what I'm worried about?</p>
<p>I'm worried he's gonna kill himself with that gun before he gets old and senile enough to rewrite us into the will.</p>
<p>That's it. That's it. We need him to live long enough so he can become fully demented.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I know, but, guys, I'm picking up, like, a super stressed-out vibe from you, and it's really important to remember, like, you know, money isn't everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course you don't care, Charlie, because your dad didn't have anything to pass down to you.</p>
<p>No, that's true, but my mom does. Yeah.</p>
<p>On my mom's family side, I got a huge inheritance coming my way.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>H-How did I not know this? You're gonna be rich?</p>
<p>Yeah. Totally. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, uh, rich in history and legacy and, uh... ( <em>clear throat</em> ) ...teeth, of course.</p>
<p>Teeth?</p>
<p>Yeah. It's a pretty sweet deal, actually, you know.</p>
<p>Everyone on my mom's side of the family, going back to the Niña and the-the Pinta and the, uh, Santa Margherita, um, they've all been putting their teeth into a jar when they die.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And, uh, when I turn 40, that sweet little piece of history's coming my way.</p>
<p>Just stop. Okay, Dee, we need to get that gun away from Frank.</p>
<p>Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.</p>
<p>You don't do something like that.</p>
<p>You know, because, like, Frank's gun is a big piece of who he is, right?</p>
<p>That's his legacy. That's his history.</p>
<p>That's like, that's like my jar of teeth, right?</p>
<p>I don't want that taken away from me when I get old.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Charlie, I got some bad news for you, bud.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You turned 40 a long time ago.</p>
<p>Yo. Hey, Ma, how you doing?</p>
<p>Hi, Mom.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, boys.</p>
<p>What brings you by?</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, hey, I want to show Mac that jar of family teeth we got.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Y-You-you do?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Ma, did you realize I was over 40?</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> ) You are?</p>
<p>Yeah, turns out. Yeah, I figured you probably forgot, too, or something, but, um, yeah, can I get that jar of teeth now, please?</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I-I'll go look for them.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, good. Go-go get my teeth, please.</p>
<p>Cool. Hey, Mom, since we're here, um, do we have any kind of, like, family heirlooms or anything?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) Like, anything of value that our family owned at some point?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hm. Okay, what if it's just, like, sentimental?</p>
<p>Just, like, proof that we existed?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Wait, what about those letters?</p>
<p>Weren't there some kind of letters that my grandfather wrote to my dad during World War II?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those letters exist? Well, well, who's got them?</p>
<p>Donald.</p>
<p>Donald? Donald who?</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Duck.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Yeah.</p>
<p>Donald... Donald Duck? What's she talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, my mom's making a joke. She's-she's really funny.</p>
<p>She's got a great sense of humor. Right, Mom?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. She's talking about my Uncle Donald.</p>
<p>Huh. I didn't even know you had an uncle Donald.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that's my dad's brother.</p>
<p>Donald McDonald?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>Donald McDonald. Wow.</p>
<p>Your dad really scored with the name Luther, I guess, huh?</p>
<p>( <em>Bonnie screams</em> )</p>
<p>Mom? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p>( <em>muffled whimper</em> )</p>
<p>Did she try to pull out her own teeth?</p>
<p>Did you just try to pull out your own teeth?</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>She clearly did.</p>
<p>I can see the pliers.</p>
<p>We can see the pliers, Mom.</p>
<p>Ah! Ugh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Why did you do that?</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to-to tell you, I gave away the jar. ( <em>crying</em> )</p>
<p>You gave away the jar of teeth? To who?</p>
<p>Your sisters.</p>
<p>To my sisters?</p>
<p>Those ungrateful bitches. What the hell, Mom?</p>
<p>They don't even live in Philly anymore.</p>
<p>They moved all the way up to northern New Jersey.</p>
<p>They're terrible to you.</p>
<p>I'm the one who stayed. I'm the one who takes care of you.</p>
<p>How could you do that?</p>
<p>( <em>screaming</em> )</p>
<p>Now she's screaming.</p>
<p>This is crazy.</p>
<p>Now she's screaming. Now she's screaming.</p>
<p>Well, you yelled at her.</p>
<p>Now Mom's screaming.</p>
<p>Now Mom's screaming.</p>
<p>Ah, I can't believe you did this.</p>
<p>Why are you yelling at her? I don't know...</p>
<p>She gave it away to my sisters.</p>
<p>They're the worst people on the planet.</p>
<p>I didn't even remember that you had sisters.</p>
<p>All right. Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Look, we're just gonna have to go and get them.</p>
<p>I think she's having a stroke, dude.</p>
<p>We're just gonna have to get in the car right now and go get them. Come on, man.</p>
<p>We should go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Let's get in the car. Let's go.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac, we're taking your car. Mom, just calm down.</p>
<p>It's okay, okay? I'm not mad at you. It's fine, okay?</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Breathe through your, breathe through your nose.</p>
<p>I love you, too. I love you, too.</p>
<p>This is fucking insane.</p>
<p>I made a mistake.</p>
<p>You did make a mistake. You did make this... All right.</p>
<p>Christ, let's get her cleaned up. All right.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to upset you.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Frank, um, could you stop scratching yourself with the gun, please?</p>
<p>I'm itchy, I'm itchy.</p>
<p>I-I bet.</p>
<p>Probably from rolling around in the grass outside of your apartment.</p>
<p>No, I was rolling around in the grass because I was itchy.</p>
<p>The itch came first.</p>
<p>Okay, well, why don't you hand me the gun, and I'll scratch you with my fingers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna hand you my gun, but I'll let you scratch. You want to scratch me?</p>
<p>Go on. ( <em>grunts</em> ) Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Scratch me. See.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do it down by the neck.</p>
<p>Frank, I...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: The back of the neck. The back of the neck.</p>
<p>Okay, but I just don't want to get shot again, is all.</p>
<p>The gun's not loaded.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what you said last time, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: ( <em>grunts</em> ) I got to take a piss.</p>
<p>Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>( <em>grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>This is not working.</p>
<p>Should we just attack him and take it?</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>He'd mow us down like Scarface. We can't come at him like that.</p>
<p>We'll spook him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what? He needs to be lulled into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>You don't tell a dog you're taking him to a vet to put him down.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You give that dog the best day of his life, and then you turn out the lights when he least suspects it.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. Oh...</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Ooh, that was a long wait.</p>
<p>Woo.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>♪ Just can't wait... ♪</p>
<p>Why is your mom driving my mom's car?</p>
<p>I don't know. Dude, they got some weird arrangement worked out so your mom can focus on smoking.</p>
<p>Speaking of, I'm getting choked to death back here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mac, do you mind, like, cracking a window or something?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why not? I mean, it's ridiculous to just sit in the smoke.</p>
<p>'Cause it's too drafty. It's unhealthy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>

<p>Sorry, my mom's on a new health kick. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Can we, like speed up or something?</p>
<p>Another car just passed us. Mom, that's, like, the 50th car.</p>
<p>Why are you going so slow?</p>
<p>Well, highways are scary.</p>
<p>You're going 35.</p>
<p>I can see you're going 35.</p>
<p>But... And everybody's just in such a hurry.</p>
<p>No, it's just the normal...</p>

<p>How much further? Mac?</p>
<p>Mac? Hello?</p>
<p>( <em>whispering</em> ): My mom's finger is up, which means "no talking".</p>

<p>Mm, no. That... No, you just stay on the 206 the whole way up.</p>
<p>No, no, we're gonna, we're gonna hit Hamburg on the way.</p>

<p>Hamburgers.</p>
<p>Oh, hamburgers?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, that's one of the best food there is.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, they really are.</p>
<p>And, you know what, you can eat them right here in the car.</p>
<p>You know, once in a while, they give me the runs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's why we put that towel down for you, buddy.</p>
<p>Mmm. Mmm!</p>

<p>Yeah, really hammering them down there, huh, bud?</p>
<p>Very good. Mmm.</p>
<p>Oh! ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>I almost ate my gun.</p>

<p>Oh, I haven't been here in forever.</p>
<p>Go check it out... Oh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Did-did you just slam your head into the window?</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't realize it was up.</p>
<p>Well, were you gonna dive out of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was very excited. I want to go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Go see the boys.</p>
<p>Have fun, buddy.</p>
<p>Go see the boys.</p>
<p>Get after it.</p>

<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>I don't know how much more of this I can take.</p>
<p>Hey, we're almost there, Dee, okay? He's getting tired.</p>
<p>Let's let run him around the bridge for a little while, and then we have one more stop, okay?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Oh, he's pissing on another hydrant.</p>
<p>Okay. He's... literally turning into a dog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got to smash.</p>
<p>You just smashed. You smashed, like, three times on the way up here. We keep having to pull over so you can smash. What...</p>
<p>There is a lot of smashing.</p>
<p>She's very regular.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I'm out of paper towels.</p>
<p>Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Mrs. Kelly.</p>
<p>I'm sure my Uncle Donald has toilet paper.</p>
<p>You've been wiping with paper towels?</p>
<p>I hope everyone brought their appetite because I made quiche.</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Aw, that's really nice, Uncle Donald, but we're kind of in a hurry.</p>
<p>W-Well, that's a shame. ( <em>stammers</em> )</p>
<p>We never get to see each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a shame, but I'm really here about the letters.</p>
<p>You know, the letters that Grandpop wrote to you and Dad during the war.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, yes, yes, I-I-I have those letters.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>I was kind of hoping they would pass down to me.</p>
<p>You know, sort of like a family heirloom.</p>
<p>Well, that would make sense because, well, they weren't actually written to me.</p>
<p>They were addressed only, uh, to your dad.</p>
<p>Grandpop didn't write to you?</p>
<p>He-he liked your dad, uh... more.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, I was the, um, you know, "funny" one, you know.</p>
<p>It's the reason I never got married.</p>
<p>Not something we talked about back then, but... but i-it always made me feel, uh, a little, uh... different.</p>
<p>Well, I-I'm sure you can understand what that feels like, Ronald.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So, the letters?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. ( <em>laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is, uh, this is great, Uncle Donald, 'cause it's really gonna tie a lot of things together for me, you know?</p>
<p>It's, uh... I have something to pass down to my kids.</p>
<p>It's-it's important to have a legacy.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. You know, I... I wouldn't know, though. I, you know, I... I don't have any children of my own.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>whispers</em> ): What is this guy's deal?</p>
<p><strong>Donald</strong>: Oh, here they are.</p>
<p>( <em>whispers</em> ): It's, like, everything you've ever wanted.</p>
<p>Kind of sad, really, uh, me keeping letters that, uh, weren't even for me.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) You know. But, uh...</p>
<p>I guess I just, uh, wanted a connection, uh...</p>
<p>( <em>sniffles</em> )</p>
<p>...with my dad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That is sad.</p>
<p>If I could just... Yeah. Thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there's nothing more... more important in this world than the connection between a father and a son.</p>
<p>Well, besides the connection between a son and a mother.</p>
<p>Right, Mom?</p>
<p>She's smashing.</p>
<p>Yeah, she took off, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, she had to smash.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we could wait for her in the car.</p>
<p>This is so annoying.</p>
<p>I mean, you're gonna take time out of my day, and you have everything you've ever dreamed of right here, but we're gonna just blow right past it, aren't we?</p>
<p>It's probably time to go, huh?</p>
<p>Well, uh, o-okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well-well, uh, you know, hey, if you ever want to, uh, you know, hang out, you know, we could throw the old football around.</p>
<p>Ah, I don't really like playing football.</p>
<p>It's kind of for jocks.</p>
<p>It's all he ever talks about...</p>
<p>No, it's like...</p>
<p>...is wanting to have a catch with his dad, so...</p>
<p>Nah, 'cause remember we were talking about how it was like a... for jocks?</p>
<p>Uh, no. That never happened.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, well, uh, we could read.</p>
<p>We could read.</p>
<p>Oh, but, like, he can't read.</p>
<p>Imagine that. Imagine that.</p>
<p>He can't read, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, but he's not talking about me, he's talking about bonding with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, like...</p>
<p>But we're gonna blow right past this, huh?</p>
<p>Reading is for nerds, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, is that what it is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, cards?</p>
<p>Uh, well, the thing about cards is, like, with the... the jacks and the queens and the kings and, like, I don't like celebrating royalty.</p>
<p>You know, he-he knows that.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, man.</p>
<p>You know that. We've talked about that.</p>
<p>You're driving me crazy, dude. All right, fine, let's go.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe you guys can swap phone numbers or...</p>
<p>I think that would be weird.</p>
<p>No? No, not gonna do it?</p>
<p>That would be weird. Okay.</p>
<p>Fine, then this was a good waste of our time, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Well, t Yep.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Beautiful. Probably brings back a lot of good memories.</p>
<p>Right, Frank?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys, uh, mind if I...</p>
<p>Oh, no. Of course. No, please. Please. Yeah.</p>
<p>Please. Yeah.</p>
<p>Take that you, cesspool.</p>
<p>Polluted sack of shit.</p>
<p>You know, Dee, I kind of feel like we did a good thing here.</p>
<p>I do, too. We gave him a good day.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>For him.</p>
<p>Not for a normal person.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah. Jesus.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You all done, bud?</p>
<p>Yeah. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Good. Hey, oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, where to now, Frank?</p>
<p>We want to take you somewhere.</p>
<p>Uh, no, it's okay. I get it.</p>
<p>I-I thought it was a cash grab at first, but I see where you're going.</p>
<p>The hamburger, playing with Duncan under the bridge, and now the beach.</p>
<p>A perfect day can't last forever.</p>
<p>I know why we're here.</p>
<p>Oh. You do?</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Gosh.</p>
<p>Thanks for making it so easy on us.</p>
<p>We expected more resistance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I guess hung on a little bit too long.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>And afterwards, you guys can have the money.</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> ) You mean it?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. Here.</p>
<p>Oh. Gosh.</p>
<p>I-I got to say, this-this went so much more smoothly than I...</p>
<p>Yeah, it really did.</p>
<p>Uh, just do it when I'm looking out at the ocean.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Ah, don't be coy. I had a good run.</p>
<p>What are you...</p>
<p>And it's really good you didn't do it in front of Charlie.</p>
<p>That was a class move.</p>
<p>Just put me down quick.</p>
<p>Put you down? Wha...</p>
<p>Oh, you know what? I think I'm gonna run, and then you do what you have to do.</p>
<p>But if you shoot me in the leg, come over and finish me off, because I don't want to lay there and suffer.</p>
<p>Actually, here, I'm gonna take...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go natural, because I've seen too many guys die and take a shit in their pants.</p>
<p>I don't want that. And bury my poop.</p>
<p>Or just kick some sand over it.</p>
<p>'Cause... And then you can do what you want to do.</p>
<p>You can float me out into the ocean and let sharks eat me.</p>
<p>Or you can leave me on the ground, gruesome for the kids to see.</p>
<p>Oh, ugh. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>We are not gonna kill you, Frank.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What, did you think we were just gonna shoot you right here on the beach?</p>
<p>I mean, there-there's people around.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised they didn't run when you started shooting the ocean.</p>
<p>I-I'm not.</p>
<p>It's the Jersey Shore. But good God, man.</p>
<p>Well, if you're not gonna snuff me out, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>We were giving you one last day with your gun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's time to let it go, Frank.</p>
<p>You were stealing my gun?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Well...</p>
<p>Screw that.</p>
<p>No, it's too dangerous, Frank.</p>
<p>You're out of control with that thing.</p>
<p>By the way, you're out of the will again.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why? Just because of the gun?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly. Because I don't trust you two guys.</p>
<p>I mean, if you're in the will, who knows?</p>
<p>You may wind up shooting me in the back.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>You just told us to shoot you in the back!</p>
<p>That's different. It's not the same thing.</p>
<p>Take me back to Philly.</p>
<p>You get an Uber.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Get in the car.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Go on. Let's go.</p>
<p>Dee, why'd you let him snatch that thing back?</p>
<p>I-I...</p>
<p>All right, let's go.</p>
<p>Just barge right in, Mom.</p>
<p>O-Okay.</p>
<p>Don't-don't be shy, okay?</p>
<p>Bunny?</p>
<p>Candy?</p>
<p>Are you home?</p>
<p>Which one is the can?</p>
<p>There's probably, like, a million bathrooms.</p>
<p>Just go find a bathroom, Mrs. Mac.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>I don't remember those being your sisters' names.</p>
<p>No, it's not their names. They had their names changed.</p>
<p>Oh. How do they afford to live like this?</p>
<p>T-They're doing some, like, stupid, like, social media thing.</p>
<p>I-I don't know, I guess they're making a killing on it.</p>
<p>Hey! Candy, Bunny!</p>
<p>Candy...</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Mom, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Well, we just wanted to drive up...</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Why'd you bring Dirt Grub?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, hi. Nice to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Shut up, fag!</p>
<p>Why'd you bring your fag friend?</p>
<p>Yeah, why is Mac here?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>This is so distasteful.</p>
<p>Uh, dude, uh...</p>
<p>You know what? I'm not gonna argue with you guys.</p>
<p>Oh, you're not?</p>
<p>Okay? No, I'm just here for the teeth.</p>
<p>No, you can't have them.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can't have them, Charlie.</p>
<p>You can't have them.</p>
<p>Mom gave them to us.</p>
<p>Well, what do you even care about the teeth?</p>
<p>I-I thought you always said they were weird and gross.</p>
<p>They are weird and gross.</p>
<p>Yeah, super gross, but people like that stuff, so we need them.</p>
<p>We need them.</p>
<p>Need them for what?</p>
<p>ASMR, dickweed.</p>
<p>Yeah. ASMR.</p>
<p>What is that? What even is that?</p>
<p>We stick our hands in the jar.</p>
<p>People pay to watch us stick our hand in the jar.</p>
<p>They pay for that shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They like the noise of the teeth, and they give us a lot of money on OnlyFans.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of money.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>More than you could ever imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All your doing is sticking your hands in teeth and people pay you enough to live like this?</p>
<p>We obviously take our tops off. Like...</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>Oh, girls.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Shut up, slut.</p>
<p>You're literally a slut.</p>
<p>All right, you know what? Give me the teeth. Give me the teeth.</p>
<p>No. Finders keepers, bitch.</p>
<p>Finders keepers.</p>
<p>You did not find them!</p>
<p>Mom gave them to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, she did.</p>
<p>Okay, we're her favorite.</p>
<p>I clogged the toilet.</p>
<p>What the hell? Gross.</p>
<p>Who is this old lady clogging our toilet?</p>
<p>That's my mommy.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Gross, Mac!</p>
<p>Why did you clog our toilet?</p>
<p>Why'd you clog our toilet, old lady?</p>
<p>There was no TP.</p>
<p>If there was no TP, what did you wipe with?</p>
<p>The letters.</p>
<p>You wiped your butt with the letters that Grandpop sent Dad and then flushed them down the toilet?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Bunny</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>This is so weird, guys. You got to go.</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Put that down.</p>
<p>This is gonna be the new Kelly family heirloom, and I'm gonna put all my teeth in it and all of Mom's teeth in it and none of yours.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>mumbles</em> ) Oh, uh, yep.</p>
<p>Yep. Yep.</p>
<p>You got to stop doing that. You're not gonna have any teeth left.</p>
<p>You sure you don't want to pop a couple in?</p>
<p>You know, you can be a part of my legacy, dude.</p>
<p>I-I feel like you should be.</p>
<p>No, I-I'm good.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm good.</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>When one-one falls out, go ahead and toss it in.</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>It won't.</p>
<p>( <em>gunshots</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah. There. Take that, lock.</p>
<p>Oh, what the hell, man?</p>
<p>And the door wasn't even locked.</p>
<p>You're paying for that door, Frank.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Well, this is great. This is just great.</p>
<p>You know, like, now what are we supposed to all put our teeth in?</p>
<p>Our faces?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I'm talking about our legacy.</p>
<p>You know? I can't hold onto it, man.</p>
<p>Legacy? You want to talk legacy? You know what our legacy is?</p>
<p>Spending our lives in this goddamn bar with a lunatic man who acts like a dog and handles his gun like a maniac!</p>
<p>Oh, fine.</p>
<p>I see where this pity party's headed.</p>
<p>If you're gonna be crybabies about it, all right, take my gun.</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>( <em>all groaning</em> )</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it, Frank.</p>
<p>You've officially shot everyone in the bar.</p>
