<p>Oh, no, no. No, no. Don't-don't put that on me. No, I'm just a simple actor. This, this is the man, the brains behind the whole operation.</p>
<p>No. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: <em>It's a team effort.</em></p>
<p>Wow. Hollywood celebrities right here in Philly, huh?</p>
<p>I don't love it. I mean...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>.. why can't they stay in their lane?</p>
<p>Why do they have into come into our lane?</p>
<p>The celebrity booze thing's a little out of control.</p>
<p>It's a total sellout. I mean, a complete cash grab.</p>
<p>Any idiot could take a bottle of booze, slap a celebrity's face on it and-and make a fortune.</p>
<p>I mean, we could do it if we wanted.</p>
<p>Oh, we know more about booze than these two guys, probably.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Look, yeah, is there an opportunity for us to create a booze of our own, right?</p>
<p>And go pitch those guys? Yeah, of course there is.</p>
<p>It would be so easy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It would be so easy, you know?</p>
<p>And could we do something like that?</p>
<p>Also, yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Of course, we could, you know.</p>
<p>But I mean, are we gonna go do something like that?</p>
<p>Yes, we're gonna do that, yeah.</p>
<p>Of course we are, yes.</p>
<p>I think we should.</p>
<p>I think we should.</p>
<p>It's already happening.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Okay, guys,</em> I think we can all agree we need to come up with a brand that is representative of who we are as people and as businessmen.</p>
<p>Now I ask you guys this: what's the first word that comes to your mind when you are trying to describe us?</p>
<p>Premium.</p>
<p>Mm, I was gonna say that, dude.</p>
<p>Premium.</p>
<p>I was gonna say premium.</p>
<p>You were gonna say that, too?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>And look, hey.</p>
<p>Listen, man, you're spot-on. Premium.</p>
<p>Yes, our brand will, of course, be a premium brand.</p>
<p>Now, what is the most premium alcohol ever invented?</p>
<p>Goldschläger.</p>
<p>Goldschläger. Yeah.</p>
<p>Goldschläger. All right, hey!</p>
<p>We're all on the same page here.</p>
<p>Yeah, we think--</p>
<p>This is good, I like this. Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Swiss cinnamon schnapps liqueur with drinkable flakes of gold floating in it.</p>
<p>My God, what's more premium than that?</p>
<p>Yeah, nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing, right?</p>
<p>Here's a pitch. Okay, I can get a bunch of nickels and I could smash them up and put them into a 'schläger.</p>
<p>Right? We call it Nickelschläger, and we pitch it as, like, the working man's spirit.</p>
<p>And, you know, nickels are, they're easy to find and, uh, just as shiny.</p>
<p>Well, that sounds disgusting, and, uh, potentially dangerous as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm-a try it, though.</p>
<p>Listen, I think I've pinpointed a small market trend that we could corner but that could also totally represent us.</p>
<p>I'm talking about a blend.</p>
<p>A blend?</p>
<p>Oh. Blends.</p>
<p>Yes. Blends, blends.</p>
<p>Blends!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Blends are very popular these days.</p>
<p>Wine blends, whiskey blends, you know?</p>
<p>So let me ask you this: what is the second-classiest drink in the world?</p>
<p>Jägermeister. Yes.</p>
<p>Jägermeister. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Jägermeister.</p>
<p>Jägermeister, yeah.</p>
<p>Amazing, yes.</p>
<p>It's the 'meisters and the, and the 'schlägers and the schnapps.</p>
<p>I mean, those are the drinks that make people feel high-end, you know, like they're on a European ski adventure, right?</p>
<p>( <em>all laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, it's true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those drinks that make people feel premium, you know?</p>
<p>So I say we do a blend of all the most premium drinks.</p>
<p>We put them all together, and we make one drink called Paddy's SchlägerSchnappsterMeister.</p>
<p>That's brilliant.</p>
<p>That's so smart.</p>
<p>Well, because it-it blends them...</p>
<p>Dude, that is really smart. It's fun.</p>
<p>.. all together, like you said.</p>
<p>Who's thought of that?</p>
<p>It's a lot of fun, right?</p>
<p>It's elegant.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like you're in Switzerland or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Great, so you guys get it, okay. Great.</p>
<p>So I-I'm so glad we're on the same page with this.</p>
<p>So, here's the thing. All we got to do is get those celebrity guys' blessing and boom-- we are off to the races, we're gonna be rich men, but I don't think we should approach them without being fully funded first.</p>
<p>So our first test is gonna be landing a big fish who can finance this whole operation, and I know just the guy.</p>

<p>Frank, how would you like to invest in a celebrity alcohol brand?</p>
<p>No, I don't know about that.</p>
<p>I-I once had Greg Louganis as the face of my apricot brand in the '80s.</p>
<p>But when he cracked his noggin at the Olympics, the business took a nosedive with him.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we're talking about a much bigger celebrity than that, okay?</p>
<p>We're talking about a household name here.</p>

<p>Changed the game, Frank.</p>
<p>That it did. That it did.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yes. Yes.</p>

<p>That it did. One of the greatest shows of all time.</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Pardon my language.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry about that. Uh, pardon my driving.</p>
<p>I haven't driven a car in a long, long time.</p>
<p>I-- We really got to start vetting these drivers.</p>
<p>Okay? If we're driving around in these crappy town cars with lunatics and now we're flying coach?</p>
<p>Counterpoint.</p>
<p>Coach?</p>
<p>I do like the grit.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Don't you?</p>
<p>I mean, it's associating with the common man.</p>
<p>Talking about me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>When I first stepped onto the boards in the Great White Way of Broadway...</p>
<p>Oh, and here we go again about Broadway.</p>
<p>Was I in the role of Richard III? No.</p>
<p>Were you? No?</p>
<p>Slipping it in, of course.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was his understudy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>I never really got to be on stage.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I was very close.</p>
<p>You had to earn it, huh?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>You had to earn it.</p>
<p>It's all about the work, isn't it?</p>
<p>See? He's working, we're working.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're-- We are working.</p>
<p>Now, you can never forget where you came from.</p>
<p>Remember how you got here? Remember, huh?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This clown lost all of his money playing slots at Pechanga. Yeah.</p>
<p>It-- I-I--</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: No, you have a problem. You know you have a problem.</p>
<p>The first step: admitting you have a problem.</p>
<p>I admit I am a servant to the gods of chance.</p>
<p>I pray at their altar.</p>
<p>Yeah, way too much.</p>
<p>Come on, baby.</p>
<p>Way too much.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on, baby!</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Let 'er roll!</p>
<p>Let 'er rip!</p>
<p>No, this guy was a week away from sucking off tourists, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>To pay his rent, and you know that.</p>
<p>Fellas, you're not gonna have to suck anyone off.</p>
<p>I'm taking you guys straight to a private plane today.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, great. Finally. See? See?</p>
<p>There you go. Aren't you happy?</p>
<p>Doesn't that feel nice?</p>
<p>I'm very happy. Yes.</p>
<p>( <em>phone ringing</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Finally. Okay.</p>
<p>Sorry, I happen to be getting another-another call here.</p>
<p>I got to take it. Hello, this is the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Oh, my...</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie! You said to call when we landed.</p>
<p>What? We landed?</p>
<p>We landed 20 minutes ago. I'm just gassing up.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it, why didn't you tell me that?</p>
<p>I wouldn't have eaten the disgusting oysters.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>You ate those oysters?</p>
<p>What? You told me to.</p>
<p>That can is from a shellfish company I started with Tony Danza back in the '80s.</p>
<p>Tony's Oysters in a Can-za?</p>
<p>It was a catchy name. Didn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>Goddamn you.</p>
<p>Gross. I am out of here.</p>
<p>( <em>coughing</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>Frank?</p>
<p>Charlie.</em></p>
<p>Uh, this is Mr. Frank.</p>
<p>He's the owner of the plane.</p>
<p>Oh, perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, Mr. Frank? I have the father and son.</p>
<p>You got them, Charlie? Bring them over right away.</p>
<p>All right. Ha, ha!</p>
<p>Charlie got Malcolm and his dad.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Are you serious?</p>
<p>( <em>whoops</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, I'm staying.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You've been complaining about getting off the plane.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden you're staying?</p>
<p>( <em>coughs</em> )</p>
<p>All right. Hey, guys. Come on.</p>
<p>Let's go. Out of the cabin.</p>
<p>What-what-- I'm not leaving my plane.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we've had this whole situation where Jalen Hurts felt trapped and he just freaked out and ran away.</p>
<p>It was not Jalen Hurts, okay?</p>
<p>It was literally just some Black guy.</p>
<p>I-- It was definitely Jalen Hurts. Either way...</p>
<p>It was not Jalen Hurts.</p>
<p>.. let's just go. Let's go.</p>
<p>Let's go. Come on.</p>
<p>Up, up, up.</p>
<p>Ugh, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Now, this is how to travel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, but I always wonder at whose expense.</p>
<p>You know, when I was making my way on the Great White Way of Broadway...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Jesus-- Hey.</p>
<p>It was hard.</p>
<p>You know, I-I have an idea.</p>
<p>Why don't you just shut your eyes and go to sleep?</p>
<p>And then I will let you know when you can wake up.</p>
<p>Okay? Shh.</p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, but sleep's for pussies.</p>
<p>Geez.</p>
<p>Let's party, am I right? Hey, guys, I'm Dee.</p>
<p>Jesus, where'd you come from?</p>
<p>I didn't know we were sharing the plane.</p>
<p>Yeah, I--</p>
<p>Ah! ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Frank, the owner.</p>
<p>And you don't have to share the plane.</p>
<p>This plane, this pretty little bird can be yours for a mere price of $35 mil.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Sorry, actually, um...</p>
<p>( <em>Aaron groans</em> )</p>
<p>It's a beautiful bird.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, don't worry.</p>
<p>We're not-not here to sell you a plane. Frank, please, don't.</p>
<p>Yeah, we want to-- We-we'd sell the plane...</p>
<p>We would, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>.. if you would go for it, you'd buy it.</p>
<p>Just-- We're not selling the plane.</p>
<p>Okay, we're here to sell you, um--</p>
<p>A lifestyle...</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>.. and ill-fitting suits.</p>
<p>No, no, no, uh, that-that's also wrong.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>We're not selling any of that, okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>No, no, no. Let's-let's... No.</p>
<p>We're here to sell you a, uh--</p>
<p>Nickelschläger!</p>
<p>No, goddamn it! None of that.</p>
<p>None of that. Okay, listen-listen to me. Listen.</p>
<p>Look, we're just-- Listen.</p>
<p>He's the driver.</p>
<p>Let's just start over, okay?</p>
<p>We're gonna start all over, and we're gonna do it with a firm handshake.</p>
<p>Oh. I'm not supposed to.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, man.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I think you're in an abusive relationship.</p>
<p>Okay! This is absolutely insane.</p>
<p>Put your hand down, Bryan.</p>
<p>But I don't mind shaking his hand, really, I don't--</p>
<p>No, put it down, you silly little bitch.</p>
<p>Put it down.</p>
<p>Put it down.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Don't you touch him.</p>
<p>I said no.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: What? Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Sit down.</p>
<p>Please, just sit down.</p>
<p>You want us to sit down?</p>
<p>Sit down, please, all of you.</p>
<p>We-we will sit down.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, why don't we all sit down?</p>
<p>I don't ask for a lot.</p>
<p>An Emmy here, a Tony there.</p>
<p>Little pocket change for the one-armed succubus in Reno.</p>
<p>But you.</p>
<p>You, you're-- It's never enough for you.</p>
<p>You want it all.</p>
<p>And you deceived me into thinking that-that I wanted it all, too, and I don't.</p>
<p>And you took charge of our little operation, and ever since then, you've been... you've been controlling my life.</p>
<p>You control everything.</p>
<p>Or do you?</p>
<p>Maybe... you are the one being deceived.</p>
<p>Maybe being the front man of an alcohol business places your head so far out in front of you that you don't even realize that your neck is exposed.</p>
<p>Enough to be lopped off by a public so thirsty to taste the blood of greedy celebrities.</p>
<p>So, when they come-- and they will-- who are they gonna come after, huh?</p>
<p>The sweet, hapless boob... or the slick-talking, scheming millennial?</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>So, I ask you... bitch... who is really in charge here?</p>
<p>( <em>sniffs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is acting.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>What? Wow!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>That was--</p>
<p>That-that was all fake?</p>
<p>Made it all up. Fake, fake, fake, fake.</p>
<p>No offense, anything I said.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you're welcome...</p>
<p>I was just joking.</p>
<p>But I do love to perform.</p>
<p>I do, it's in my blood.</p>
<p>You got the stuff.</p>
<p>Uh, you should consider doing a drama, Mr. Middle.</p>
<p>You really should consider doing drama.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>I think you got the goods, man.</p>
<p>Hey, so listen, do you guys want to invest?</p>
<p>Boss?</p>
<p>fuck no.</p>
<p>fuck no! No.</p>
<p>fuck no!</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Of course not. I don't want to spend another moment with you crazies.</p>
<p>Not another minute.</p>
<p>You people are insane.</p>
<p>Get me off this plane.</p>
<p>( <em>crowd chanting backwards</em> )</p>
