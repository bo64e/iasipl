<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I have high blood pressure?</p>
<p>Well, yes, but that's consistent with your last visit.</p>
<p>We might want to put you on a low dose of blood pressure medication.</p>
<p>Oh... no.</p>

<p>Listen, I-I can see where you're headed with this.</p>
<p>Let's-let's not go there, okay?</p>
<p>If I wanted my blood pressure to be low, I would simply command my body to make it low.</p>
<p>That's really not how chronic high blood pressure works.</p>
<p>Okay, well, it is how it works with Dennis Reynolds, okay?</p>
<p>And if I'm chronically having high blood pressure, it's because I'm chronically suffering fools who won't listen to me when I say that I can do things.</p>
<p>Uh, you know what, Doc? It's fi...</p>
<p>I'm gonna take control of this, okay?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the phones are at our warehouse, so...</p>

<p>Those aren't the phones.</p>
<p>Those aren't the phones?</p>

<p>Um, what if we add a new line to the Frank Reynolds family plan?</p>
<p>Would that make me a new customer?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can do that. I just need your PIN.</p>
<p>Right, 'cause the PIN's the key to the phone, and the phone's the key to the car, and everything's been streamlined.</p>

<p>That's okay. Daisy, was it?</p>
<p>Listen, don't be sorry, okay? I'm not mad at you.</p>
<p>I'm a little upset, but I'm upset at the situation, okay?</p>
<p>And-and the situation is this, Daisy.</p>
<p>If you'll just give me a second and indulge me, okay?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) My new phone won't talk to my car.</p>
<p>Okay, so I called the car rental company, and they put me on with a supervisor who told me to call Tsuma Roadside, so I called Tsuma Roadside.</p>
<p>Spoke to someone over there who put me on with another supervisor who told me to call the service center.</p>
<p>So I called the service center, spoke to about--</p>
<p>I don't know-- two, three morons over there who had no answers for me whatsoever.</p>
<p>They put me on with one of their supervisors, and that person told me to call the car rental company again.</p>
<p>So I called the car rental company, then roadside, service center, rental company, roadside, service center, rental company, roadside, service center, and around and around and around like that for hours and hours, until finally someone had the presence of mind to let me know there's a goddamn customer care line.</p>
<p>Okay, so I called the customer care line and now I find myself talking to you, Daisy, my little wildflower.</p>
<p>And you ask me to enter in my VIN and my date of birth again, information which I already entered into your system.</p>
<p>Okay, now, now, listen, Daisy, Daisy, bear with me here, okay?</p>
<p>I know you didn't create the system, okay?</p>
<p>So you are not to blame.</p>
<p>But somebody did create the system, and I would very much like to blame that person.</p>
<p>So... who is that?</p>
<p><em>Sir, I'm sorry. Who is...?</em></p>
<p>Who is the person who created your customer service system in such a way that the information entered into the computer isn't passed on to the human representative?!</p>
<p><em>Sir, I don't know. I can send you to one of my supervisors.</em></p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. No, Dai... no.</p>
<p>No, don't send me to a supervisor, Daisy.</p>
