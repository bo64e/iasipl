<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. "Congratulations, Paddy's Pub.</em> We are pleased to report that we are interested in featuring your bar on an upcoming episode of our show. We will be sending a producer to do a walk-through soon. Warmly, your friends at... <em>Bar Rescue!"</em></p>
<p>Yes! ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>This is like our dreams come true, right?</p>
<p>What? To be on a reality TV show?</p>
<p>Yeah. Wh-- How did this happen?</p>
<p>I've been writing them a letter every week since the show first started.</p>
<p>Well, how long's it been?</p>
<p>Too long.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I very much do want to be famous, but I don't know if I want to be on a reality show where they try and make us look like jerks.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Right. Oh, right, yeah.</p>
<p>'Cause, like, what if they, like, edit it to, like, make me look stupid or something?</p>
<p>Yeah. This is a definite pass for me. I'm out.</p>
<p>This could be huge for us.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>I'm a little disappointed that you didn't tell me earlier because I would have been working out for weeks in preparation.</p>
<p>I mean, for God's sakes, man.</p>
<p>What if, what if my shirt falls off?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I'm a little off my regimen, too.</p>
<p>Like, I haven't even been doing any of my workouts.</p>
<p>Ever. He never has. Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys are missing the bigger picture here.</p>
<p>I mean, wh-what are the odds that they would pick our bar?</p>
<p>This is a million-to-one shot, and I've got a really good feeling about this, guys.</p>
<p>Things are about to change here at Paddy's Pub because our luck just turned around.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Mac, stop.</p>
<p>The second I clean it up, you're making more crumbs.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>There should be more crumbs.</p>
<p>We should put crumbs all over the goddamn bar.</p>
<p>Sorry, but, Charlie, why am I seeing so many silverfish?</p>
<p>I-I don't know where they're coming from, man.</p>
<p>I cannot get rid of them.</p>
<p>You should not get rid of them.</p>
<p>Don't you guys understand what <em>Bar Rescue</em> is?</p>
<p>These are the exact kind of things that John Taffer's gonna come in and hand our asses to us about.</p>
<p>( <em>sputters</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>No, I don't-I don't want to have my ass handed to me.</p>
<p>I mean, how the bar comes across is a reflection of how I come across. Okay?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I, for one, don't want to be known as a silverfish man. Okay?</p>
<p>I want to look good for the people watching in their...</p>
<p>In, uh, th-the...</p>
<p>Uh... What's the-the thing?</p>
<p>The-the boxes that-that people live in?</p>
<p>You talking about their homes?</p>
<p>Y-- Uh, yes, yeah. Their homes.</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p>Jesus. I couldn't think of that word. That's so weird.</p>
<p>Guys, we have a problem.</p>
<p>But whatever you do, don't laugh.</p>
<p>( <em>laughter</em> )</p>
<p>How are we not supposed to laugh at that?</p>
<p>I wouldn't laugh at that.</p>
<p>This is not funny, all right? It's not a joke.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on with my face, but it's broken or something.</p>
<p>( <em>laughter</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: It's very funny.</p>
<p>That's really funny.</p>
<p>( <em>groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>My egg's all bloody.</p>
<p>Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This is bad, dude.</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff that starts happening when someone's put a curse on you.</p>
<p>Curse? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let's just stop and think for a second, okay?</p>
<p>Like, Dee, did you have any run-ins with anyone who might have put a curse on you?</p>
<p>I mean, I had a tiny little issue with a neighbor last night.</p>
<p>( <em>gunfire on TV</em> )</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>( <em>knocking</em> )</p>
<p>Spewing my hate all over your teenage asses.</p>
<p>What? ( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>Banging the goddamn door down. What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What? Why are you trying to break my door down at 3:00 in the morning?</p>
<p>I baked you some brownies.</p>
<p>Why you baking me shit?</p>
<p>Trying to poison me?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) No.</p>
<p>I just wanted to kindly ask if you could keep the noise down.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Oh. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>I didn't realize.</p>
<p>That was really sweet of you...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>.. to bake these for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, I have something for you also.</p>
<p>Oh, it's so nice. What is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it's a trophy. See?</p>
<p>It says "cuոt of the Year."</p>
<p>That's you.</p>
<p>You are a nasty woman, and bad things are going to happen to you one day.</p>
<p>I guarantee it.</p>
<p>Drop dead.</p>
<p>Well, there you go. It sounded like that lady cursed you.</p>
<p>I don't know. I call old ladies cuոts all the time. We all do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>No, she brings up a good point.</p>
<p>We do. We do.</p>
<p>I called an old lady a cuոt this morning.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Did you? Yeah.</p>
<p>I sure did. I sure did.</p>
<p>No, I might've done it, too, actually.</p>
<p>Honestly, for me this raises an even bigger concern.</p>
<p>Okay. What's that?</p>
<p>Dee had no right to give that trophy away.</p>
<p>I mean, we worked very, very hard on that.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groans</em> )</p>
<p>We did. It's not easy to make.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to do it.</p>
<p>Plus, she earned it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you earned it.</p>
<p>And you earned it.</p>
<p>And you're just gonna give it away? I mean...</p>
<p>Either way, this is all bullshit anyway, because we're not having bad luck, we're having good luck.</p>
<p>What about my egg?</p>
<p>You know what that might've been?</p>
<p>Y-You might've gotten cursed when you killed that seabird.</p>
<p>What seabird?</p>
<p>Oh, I didn't tell you guys about this? Okay.</p>
<p>So, the other day, uh, Frank's making a banana daiquiri.</p>
<p>Seagull flies right into the bar.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Yeah. Here you go.</p>
<p>It's tasty.</p>
<p>( <em>squawking</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A seagull.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>( <em>squawking</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, a little birdie.</p>
<p>Oh, what a sweet little birdie.</p>
<p>You want some food? Want some?</p>
<p>( <em>seagull squawking</em> )</p>
<p>Whoa! shit, Frank!</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>Ah, Frank. Jesus.</p>
<p>Come here, you rat, die!</p>
<p>( <em>grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Ah! Goddamn!</p>
<p>And die, you fucking seagull.</p>
<p>bitch. fucking cuոt.</p>
<p>Well, it's bad luck if a seabird flies into a building.</p>
<p>No, dude. It's bad luck to kill a seabird.</p>
<p>Every sailor knows that.</p>
<p>I don't sail.</p>
<p>Charlie, will you stop trying to turn our good fortune into bad fortune?</p>
<p>All this doom and gloom. Nobody is cursed.</p>
<p>Oh, really, Mac? Because I straight-up heard Cricket curse you yesterday.</p>
<p>All right. It's time to make good on your end of the bargain, Mac.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I still need proof.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, man. Don't start with that.</p>
<p>We had--</p>
<p>Cricket, what are you doing in here, man?</p>
<p>That's what I was just saying.</p>
<p>Cricket, what are you doing in here?</p>
<p>What? What-what-- No, we're-we're talking business.</p>
<p>Business? I'm not doing business with you, street trash.</p>
<p>What is your deal, man? What-what...</p>
<p>One second you need me, the next I'm a pile of garbage?</p>
<p>Is that what this is?</p>
<p>Cricket, beat it, man...</p>
<p>You better beat it or I'm gonna beat you with my shoe!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Get out of the bar, dude.</p>
<p>You know what? Screw you guys.</p>
<p>Oh. Hey, Mac.</p>
<p>A curse on you.</p>
<p><em>Vos omnes maledicti mille annis.</em></p>
<p>I mean, he-he literally cursed you, man.</p>
<p>Now, guys, come on. We got to take this seriously.</p>
<p>Like, let's look at this. Like, uh, Frank.</p>
<p>Let-Let's do our homework on sailors' curses.</p>
<p>Dee, Mac, go make your apologies.</p>
<p>I will do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>In fact, I am done listening to this.</p>
<p>It's irritating, anti-God, and most importantly will not make for good <em>Bar Rescue</em> banter.</p>
<p>I am leaving.</p>
<p>Come on, man!</p>
<p>Charlie, how do you know all this curse...</p>
<p>Stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That-- I mean, look, maybe it's real, maybe it's not.</p>
<p>But, like, look at it this way.</p>
<p>Like, i-if a black cat crosses your path, do you spit over your left shoulder?</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You guys don't do that one?</p>
<p>I don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, like, when you're hopeful for something, though, do you knock on wood?</p>
<p>Oh, that one. No. No.</p>
<p>Nah... No.</p>
<p>I've heard of that one, but I don't do it.</p>
<p>Well, do you make a wish when you blow out a damn candle? I mean...</p>
<p>Of course we do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, that one I do.</p>
<p>You know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Candles, yeah, I like that.</p>
<p>Well, 'cause I want my wishes to come true.</p>
<p>Okay. And why do you do it?</p>
<p>You do it just in case.</p>
<p>Just in case it's real, right?</p>
<p>And "just in case" is as good a reason to believe in anything as any.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>This is such a waste of time.</p>
<p>I got to call a doctor or something.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you definitely should.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you have Bell's palsy.</p>
<p>I, uh, I looked it up.</p>
<p>But first you got to apologize to your neighbor.</p>
<p>Yeah. Just in case? Hmm?</p>
<p>Just in ca-- No, no.</p>
<p>I don't believe in that bullshit. No.</p>
<p>She's got the trophy. I want to get the trophy back.</p>
<p>You had no right to give that to her.</p>
<p>I swear to God, if she doesn't have that thing, I'm gonna paralyze the other side of your face.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>'Cause I want it. Come on, that's-that's crazy.</p>
<p>You-you have to be nominated for that.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Hello, um, you don't know me, but I'm the brother of this horrible woman, and she just wanted to come by and tell you that she's very...</p>
<p>Uh, she-she feels-- She, uh... ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, what's the word?</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) To make better the feelings?</p>
<p>"Sorry"?</p>
<p>Sorry. Yes. Goddamn.</p>
<p>Um... I don't know what that-- Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, and also, she, um...</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) She gave you something, uh, a trophy, and-and it was not hers to give.</p>
<p>Do-do you perhaps still have that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have it. I'll get it.</p>
<p>Yeah? Okay, great.</p>
<p>You know what? I got to look up some clinics, 'cause I really need a doctor to fix my face before we're on TV.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Whoa. Did-did you see that?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>See what?</p>
<p>Uh, a black cat just ran out of her apartment.</p>
<p>It just...</p>
<p>I didn't see a cat.</p>
<p>You kidding me? It ran right past us.</p>
<p>Well, that's not good.</p>
<p>A black cat?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, shit. What'd Charlie say we were supposed to do if we saw it? That's a bad omen.</p>
<p>Oh. ( <em>spits</em> )</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Uh-oh. I got you, didn't I? Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Yes, you did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Boy, that's a shame.</p>
<p>Thank you for this, though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, listen, um... Do you have a cat?</p>
<p>'Cause I think I just saw one run out of your apartment.</p>
<p>A cat?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. A little black cat?</p>
<p>I had a little black cat. Her name was Maureen.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>But she's been dead for years.</p>
<p>Huh. That's crazy.</p>
<p>I was, I was murdered to a woman named Maureen.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>No, I meant married. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I was married to a woman named Maureen.</p>
<p>I-I...</p>
<p>That's so weird. I swear I saw a cat.</p>
<p>You know what? This place is full of cats.</p>
<p>Can we get out of here, please?</p>
<p>Yeah, go. Go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And please keep the noise down at night.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, you got it, cuոt.</p>
<p>Are you sure about this, Cricket?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure about it, man.</p>
<p>I've been greasing the doormen of this building for years.</p>
<p>Chase Utley's back in town.</p>
<p>He's coming out of his apartment any second now.</p>
<p>Is it good intel? 'Cause I only got one good shot at this.</p>
<p>Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. What do I know?</p>
<p>I'm just a street rat, right?</p>
<p>I'm just trash. That's what you said.</p>
<p>Okay, Cricks, I'll tell you...</p>
<p>You've got nothing for me.</p>
<p>I knew you were gonna be a little bit of a bitch about this, so I did something nice.</p>
<p>I got you a sixer.</p>
<p>You got that for me?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a gift for you, buddy.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) There's only four in here.</p>
<p>I drank two of 'em, of course.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Well, thank you. ( <em>clears throat</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, I'm gonna buy a six-pack and not drink two?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. That's kind of the kind thing to...</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) But I-- Look, um, thank you for the four.</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, I drank four.</p>
<p>Two of those are piss.</p>
<p>Because I was stuck in the van, and you were out...</p>
<p>You know what, I don't even care, frankly.</p>
<p>I'm just glad to have a beverage.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>( <em>clears throat</em> ) All right, um...</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p><em>Dominus espritu sanctum,</em> okay?</p>
<p>You're off.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>I was, uh, I was lifting the curse that I put on you.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah, no, I don't believe in curses.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's anti-God, and God is the reason that all things happen.</p>
<p>And speaking of things that happened, I got to show you something, Cricks, but you got to keep it a secret.</p>
<p>Something wrong with your dick?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, I was waiting for this.</p>
<p>If it's your dick, though, I-I got to charge you for it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell you right now.</p>
<p>No. It's not my dick, Cricket.</p>
<p>Well, if-if you're gonna whip it out, uh, we're on the clock. All right?</p>
<p>I'm not whipping anything out!</p>
<p>There's a tiered system...</p>
<p>Look. This.</p>
<p>What? What is that?</p>
<p>It's a monkey paw, and I think it's good luck, like a rabbit's foot or something like that, 'cause ever since I found it, nothing but good things have happened.</p>
<p>Uh, sorry, I thought God was the reason that anything good happens, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, no. God <em>decides</em> who the good things happen to and then who he smites.</p>
<p>You're not following.</p>
<p>I-I can't follow it.</p>
<p>Cricket, I'm...</p>
<p>It makes literally no sense.</p>
<p>You got to pick a lane.</p>
<p>I don't even know why I even...</p>
<p><strong>Cricket</strong>: Let's get this open. I'm feeling curious.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Wait, that's-- there he is, there he is. Okay.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>( <em>car horns honk, tires screech</em> )</p>
<p>Mr. Utley?</p>
<p>Mr. Utley?</p>
<p>Mr. Utley, a moment of your time, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Utley?</p>
<p>Mr. Utley, hello?</p>
<p>Hello. Oh, hi. Hi, Mr. Utley.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, would you like an autograph?</p>
<p>Oh, no. That's a cl-- a classic, Mr. Utley.</p>
<p>I-It's me, Mac.</p>
<p>I don't know a Mac.</p>
<p>I wrote you a letter every week for the last ten years.</p>
<p>Did you not receive my letters? There was a video.</p>
<p>A video in response. Wait.</p>
<p><em>"Dear Mac, I feel like I can call you Mac because you called me Chase.</em> Thank you for the compliment on my hair. It's my fourth favorite thing after baseball, running fast and my dad. I'm sorry your dad doesn't like you. Maybe you could become a better son. Meeting you and having a game of catch sounds like a lot of fun, but like I said, I'm really busy playing a lot of baseball for the Phillies. I hope you have a good life. Fans like you make my life a 'grand slam.' <em>Your good friend, Chase."</em></p>
<p>Wait, you're that Mac?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I thought Mac was a little kid.</p>
<p>Yes, there's a child. A child...</p>
<p>A child born unto me. Little Mac.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He's Little Mac, I'm Big Mac, and you shall have a catch with him.</p>
<p>Your hair, it's throwing me.</p>
<p>It's making me very nervous. ( <em>exhales</em> )</p>
<p>On the Dodgers, yes, you were the Silver Fox.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, you were just the Fox.</p>
<p>I don't know, man. I'm pretty busy.</p>
<p>Yes, we're all, we're all busy, but the boy is sick.</p>
<p>He's very sick. He's, he's dying.</p>
<p>He's got leukemia and you shall have a catch with him.</p>
<p>Where's my car?</p>
<p>I'll tweet that you didn't.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I threatened you.</p>
<p>Now I'm upset and so are you.</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> )</p>
<p>A catch, we shall have? Later today.</p>
<p>Okay. Maybe, but for, like, five minutes tops.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I'm really busy.</p>
<p>( <em>knocks on window</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p>Hey, can we pick your brain about something?</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, I didn't think you could make it.</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>Yeah, shit, I forgot it's Uncle Jack's birthday.</p>
<p>Come on in, Charlie. You can sit next to me.</p>
<p>Nah, I'm good. Uh, we'll come back later or something.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, Charlie. I want a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Oh, do you? Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, all right.</p>
<p>♪ <em>Happy birthday, dear Jack</em> ♪<br />
♪ <em>Happy birthday to you.</em> ♪</p>
<p>Can we switch seats?</p>
<p>( <em>laughter</em> )</p>
<p>Okay, make a wish.</p>
<p>Oh, right, right, right. Okay, you and I hold hands.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Okay, ready?</p>
<p>( <em>exhales sharply</em> )</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Good. All right. Very good, very good.</p>
<p>Hey, you want to know my wish, Charlie?</p>
<p>Sure don't, pal.</p>
<p>Ooh, don't tell him your wish, it won't come true.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I made a wish, too.</p>
<p>How about you and me go on upstairs with some cake, Bon?</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, you don't get a wish, okay?</p>
<p>That's not how birthday candles work.</p>
<p>( <em>both laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Says who?</p>
<p>Uh, look, that's not why we're here!</p>
<p>Mom, Frank killed a seagull.</p>
<p>( <em>screams</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, that's not good, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know it's not good, Uncle Jack. Okay?</p>
<p>That's why-- that's why we came here, all right?</p>
<p>Mom, now is that the kind of thing that could put, like, a curse on Frank?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They say that a sailor's spirit lives on in the gulls, and if you kill a gull, the sailor can haunt you for the rest of its life.</p>
<p>No shit?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, is there anything we can do, or, like...</p>
<p>Well, you could slit Frank's throat with a horn of a goat and drink a bowl of his blood.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, uh, okay, yeah, maybe not, maybe not that.</p>
<p>Is, like, there anything else, or...</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>He could behead the gull and wear its skull around his neck for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Mom, that's not gonna work, 'cause we don't have the gull anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>It's at the bar.</p>
<p>What? It is?</p>
<p>Mm, yeah.</p>
<p>I kicked it under one of the booths so I didn't have to clean it up.</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> )</p>
<p>Okay, so you're telling me that you want to wear a seagull skull around your neck for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>I don't know. Could be cool.</p>
<p>No, we're not doing that. That's crazy.</p>
<p>Mom, anything else?</p>
<p>You could give the seagull a proper burial.</p>
<p>What? Well, yeah, that one, Mom. That one.</p>
<p>Why didn't you lead off with that one in the first place?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes you're at sea, Charlie, and you wouldn't have that option.</p>
<p>Do I look like I'm at sea, Mom?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>You don't know if I'm at sea?</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>You don't, uh-- Uncle Jack, stop. Stop putting your hand on me.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</em> ( <em>grunting</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> ) Looking for this.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Maureen Ponderosa.</p>
<p>Well, why do you have that?</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to keep it as a-a-a...</p>
<p>Oh, a trophy? From the murder.</p>
<p>No, not a-- What? No, not a trophy.</p>
<p>I-- As-- I wanted...</p>
<p>Like a souvenir f-from your victim.</p>
<p>Not a souvenir, no. It's-it's, a... It's a-- I wanted to keep it as a w-way to spite her.</p>
<p>Which one? Which one's it under?</p>
<p>Uh, by the jukebox. Over here.</p>
<p>Oh-- Ah!</p>
<p>Over here.</p>
<p>I see it, yeah. Let me get a trash bag.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>That's the gull Frank killed.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) All right.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Oh, that's his dead wife.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Looks like a trophy.</p>
<p>No, it's not a-a trophy, okay? ( <em>stammers</em> )</p>
<p>The crazy bitch had it in her will that she wanted to be buried in a pet cemetery, and I refused.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>You refused your wife's dying wishes to be buried in a pet cemetery? Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Because she's not a cat.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, dude, like, that's-that's the exact kind of thing that could lead to a curse.</p>
<p>That... I know.</p>
<p>I-- Yes. Okay, I get that now.</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p>This is bullshit, Cricket.</p>
<p>I don't know what you're so upset about.</p>
<p>Y-You said get a kid.</p>
<p>I mean, his name on the street is literally "Kid."</p>
<p>That's what he goes by.</p>
<p>He is a grown man.</p>
<p>I can be whatever you want me to be, champ.</p>
<p>I'll make your dreams come true.</p>
<p>Oh, he can.</p>
<p>Would you make it-- Do a, do a turn. Do a spin.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>There you go. Make it sexy. Let's go.</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, move the bangs, put the bangs.</p>
<p>Show them your face, show them your face.</p>
<p>Yeah. Huh?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>All right, yeah. You're gone.</p>
<p>Uh, here. Go.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>drug? Mm.</p>
<p>No eyes.</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It's all about respect.</p>
<p>Mac, what the hell is this?</p>
<p>Um, I believe that Cricket is now a pimp, and that was his boy slut.</p>
<p>Uh, t-that's oversimplifying it.</p>
<p>But, uh, that's-that's it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>No, we got that. He got, yeah, he means like...</p>
<p>Yes. I-I mean, what are you doing with Cricket?</p>
<p>No, he's got a monkey paw. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Oh! Come on, Cricket. That's a secret.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't keep secret. Honestly, I'm so high, I'm thinking about it, and I'm gonna go with him in the bathroom and finish up the-- Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Mac, what's going on with the monkey paw? What is this?</p>
<p>You know how I've been chasing Chase Utley for years to have a catch?</p>
<p>Well, I finally got to him and we were supposed to have a catch tomorrow with my "dying son."</p>
<p>Cricket was gonna help me find one, but he brought back a junkie.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>You actually met Chase Utley? How'd you do that?</p>
<p>Well, ever since I found this monkey's paw, my luck has totally turned around.</p>
<p>Well, actually, it wasn't just a paw.</p>
<p>It was a whole monkey behind the kegs, and he was dead.</p>
<p>He had this cash in his hand, and when I went to grab the cash, the whole hand just, like, kind of popped out, and I've been carrying it around ever since.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Monkey in the bar, right? Totally random.</p>
<p>Wha-- That-That's not random at all.</p>
<p>That's probably the monkey that worked here, robbed us and fucked our faces.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: He got stuck behind the keg.</p>
<p>It's behind the kegs?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Well, actually, I found him by the office, but I kicked him behind the kegs because I didn't feel like cleaning him up.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>( <em>all groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Well, he is decomposing and there's also a shit-ton of mold back there.</p>
<p>shit, now I smell it.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I got a new fix, all right? I got a new fix for everything.</p>
<p>We're gonna take, uh, your wife, the gull and what's left of the monkey, and we're gonna bury them all in a pet cemetery.</p>
<p>And Mac, you are gonna have a catch with Chase Utley, but not with your dying son.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>'Cause he's already dead.</p>
<p>( <em>bagpipes playing</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Chase</strong>: I'm confused.</p>
<p>This is your son?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, Mr. Utley.</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to tell you earlier.</p>
<p>He was only ten years old when he died. He's dead now.</p>
<p>Why is he buried at a pet cemetery?</p>
<p>Dogs. He loved dogs.</p>
<p>Okay, man. What is this?</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I...</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) Look, I know you're gonna think that this is crazy, but I-I found this monkey paw, and it's brought me really good luck.</p>
<p>And I know that you don't think superstitions are real, and that this is all ridiculous...</p>
<p>Not real? Of course they're real.</p>
<p>What, really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you think baseball players get out of their slumps?</p>
<p>With superstitions.</p>
<p>'Cause what they believe influences their actions.</p>
<p>But actions do have consequences.</p>
<p>Like lying, Mac.</p>
<p>Why don't you hand over that monkey paw?</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>You're right, actions do have consequences, and I...</p>
<p>I'm really sorry, man, I think...</p>
<p>Hall of Fame, baby, here I come!</p>
<p>What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p>I think Chase Utley just stole my monkey paw.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, then, maybe the curse has been lifted.</p>
<p>Oh. Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, hey, guys? Um...</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Okay, so, apparently, um... temporary facial paralysis and brain fog are all symptoms of exposure to high levels of mold.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>You know what? That might also explain the silverfish.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it does. Actually, it does.</p>
<p>They eat mold.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>And what about my egg?</p>
<p>Well, is it possible, Frank, that that egg was a seagull egg?</p>
<p>( <em>tongue clicks</em> )</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>That might've been, because, you know what, we found some eggs...</p>
<p>And we...</p>
<p>And you might've mixed them up.</p>
<p>I might've swapped-- mixed them up.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause we had store eggs and we had found eggs.</p>
<p>You did a flip-flop.</p>
<p>You did a flip-flop.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>So, the-- so, there's no curse.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. McDonald, we regret to inform you that we came by your bar and there was nobody there."</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>"After several failed attempts to reach you, we have decided to rescind our offer. We wish you the best of luck. Your friends at <em>Bar Rescue."</em></p>
<p>Damn it. If I had that monkey paw, none of this would've happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that means we are still cursed.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't, it doesn't!</p>
<p>We're not-- There is no curse.</p>
<p>Okay? Mac, no, you were never lucky.</p>
<p>Okay? You just bombarded them both with mail.</p>
<p>And you stalked Chase Utley for years.</p>
<p>We're not unlucky, okay? We're just the type of--</p>
<p>We're just the type of people to bury various animals and-and wives in a pet cemetery when we know we should be at work.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the bar.</p>
<p>( <em>soft laughter</em> )</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Uh, what about me? What about my luck?</p>
<p>I don't know, Cricks, I guess... there's no real explanation as to why bad things would happen to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it's just one of those things, Cricket.</p>
<p>That's life. That's life, sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>You got a dark cloud following you around.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: It is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: It is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: It is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Nice day.</p>
