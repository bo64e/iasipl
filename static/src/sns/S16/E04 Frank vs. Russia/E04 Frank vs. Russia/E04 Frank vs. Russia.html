<p>Wake up, wake up. Come on.</p>

<p>Right away!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Guys, make way. Make way, please.</p>
<p>Hey, wait, no, no, please.</p>
<p>Cutting it pretty close there, pal.</p>
<p>Ah, I feel like I got to take a shit.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. There's no time for that.</p>
<p>Oh, God, excuse me. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: No, no, no, no, no autographs.</p>
<p>I'm not ready for this.</p>
<p>Listen, listen.</p>
<p>You got it, you got it, you got it.</p>
<p>Listen to me.</p>

<p><strong>Mac</strong>: <em>Dennis, please.</em></p>
<p>Just... Dennis, please, please.</p>
<p>God, no.</p>
<p>Pretty please, just help me.</p>
<p>No! No, Mac.</p>
<p>I'm not helping you, okay?</p>
<p>Stop talking to me about Johnny.</p>
<p>Well, hey, I could help you with your guy troubles.</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>No, thanks, Dee. You suck with men.</p>
<p>Tell that to the guy leaving my apartment this morning.</p>
<p>That's right. Your girl got her guts pumped last night.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that is disgusting.</p>
<p>Your guts pumped?</p>
<p>Aren't you, like, 60?</p>
<p>You're not a girl.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on, Dee. This is insane.</p>
<p>I mean... really.</p>
<p>Who talks like that?</p>
<p>And, by the way, anybody can get a guy to bang them once.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I guarantee you he'll be coming back for seconds.</p>
<p>In fact, he pulled an old move of mine.</p>
<p>He took my phone "by mistake" so that he could see me again.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>How's he gonna call you?</p>
<p>Dennis, can you help me get my phone--</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, I need your help really quick, man.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Do you remember when we stole a restaurant buzzer the other day?</p>
<p>I can't find it anywhere.</p>
<p>It's a matter of national security here, man.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, no, no, I'm sure, yeah.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe it's in the back office. Let me check the back office. Frank, let me check the back office.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, Frank, could you help me with something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you kidding?</p>
<p>You want Frank's help with your guy troubles?</p>
<p>He's insanely homophobic.</p>
<p>Huh? Not anymore.</p>
<p>No, once Mac did the dance, then I get it. I get the gay thing.</p>
<p>He gets it. He's an ally now.</p>
<p>Okay, so, Frank, I need some relationship advice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm having some issues with this guy that I'm dating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to take it to the next level, you know, Right. by actually meeting this guy.</p>
<p>What, you've never met the guy?</p>
<p>No, never met him, never spoken with him, never seen him, but it's not weird because we're in constant communication through the beads.</p>
<p>The beads?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. The extra-large anal beads that I shoved up my butt, and Johnny can control them via an app on his phone.</p>
<p>And when I feel the buzz, I know it's time to go to the motel and wait. It's very romantic.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, he's never actually showed up before, but one day he will, and it's going to be hot.</p>
<p>That's it. I'm out.</p>
<p>I'm out. That's it. I don't get it. I am never gonna get it.</p>
<p>Beads? You never said anything about beads.</p>
<p>Let me-let me explain it again.</p>
<p>What beads?</p>
<p>It's beads that go into my ass.</p>
<p>The dance never said anything about no beads.</p>
<p>Frank, I found it. I found it. I found it.</p>
<p>Let's get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>We got it, guys, we're good.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: anal beads up his ass.</p>
<p>( <em>door opens, closes</em> )</p>
<p>Dennis, can you please help me get my phone back?</p>
<p>'Cause I need my phone.</p>
<p>No, Dennis, help me, though. Help me because I need help--</p>
<p>No, you are beyond help, okay?</p>
<p>You let a stranger hack your butthole. Dennis--</p>
<p>Enough! Enough.</p>
<p>It is clear that I'm not going to get a moment's peace until I foist you two off on someone else, so, fine, I will help you.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! All right, all right <em>let's go.</em></p>
<p>This is all I could find.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, this is good. Um...</p>
<p>Okay, are there, like, a pair of, like, weird spy glasses in here or anything?</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p>Aw, shit.</p>
<p>They dropped all those charges weeks ago. Wh--</p>
<p>Call you back.</p>
<p>Hey, what are you guys doing with all my research equipment?</p>
<p>Charlie and Frank are gonna play spies.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we're not playing spies, we're playing chess, okay?</p>
<p>There's a Russian grandmaster coming to town.</p>
<p>I'm entering Frank in the tournament, and then he's gonna rise through the ranks, and he's gonna beat this guy's ass, USA style.</p>
<p>So, I need the glasses, Uncle Jack, because Frank's got to be able to transmit me the board while I play along on a computer and I signal him the moves with the restaurant buzzer.</p>
<p>No, stop, stop, stop. Uh, you're gonna break it.</p>
<p>This is, uh, very sensitive equipment.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, okay. ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Look, do you have the spy glasses or not, dude?</p>
<p>Fine. I'll let you borrow them, but I'm coming with.</p>
<p>Okay? I don't want you breaking any of this.</p>
<p>A play date.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Like we used to.</p>
<p>We never did.</p>
<p>Ah... You don't remember.</p>
<p>Man, we never did.</p>
<p>I mean, what is taking Uncle Jack so long?</p>
<p>Well, why don't we just go in?</p>
<p>( <em>"Pop Goes the Weasel" playing on speakers</em> )</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>What the...</p>
<p>Is that-is that him?</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, Uncle Jack, what-what is this?</p>
<p>My ice cream truck.</p>
<p>( <em>music stops</em> )</p>
<p>You know, I-I have, like, a side business. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Ugh. All right, fine. You know what? Actually, this could work.</p>
<p>You got the spy glasses?</p>
<p>Yeah. Here they are.</p>
<p>Glasses.</p>
<p>Here's how this goes. Frank, you got the buzzer?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got the buzzer.</p>
<p>All right, so Frank's got a buzzer in his pocket, okay?</p>
<p>I'm gonna put it in my pocket.</p>
<p>So, he'll hover his hand over the piece, you know, one buzz for yes, two buzzes for no, three if you need him to switch to a different piece, okay?</p>
<p>Same goes for where to put it down. Got it?</p>
<p>Okay. Yup.</p>
<p>You clear?</p>
<p>Give me a Push Pop, will you?</p>
<p>And get him a Push Pop.</p>
<p>What? Oh, no, I-I don't have any ice cream.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. All right, fine.</p>
<p>Just... just... get to your spot and play the-- Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, I'll be watching you. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groans</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>honks</em> )</p>
<p>Hm... ( <em>mutters</em> )</p>
<p>Should I go here?</p>
<p>( <em>buzzes twice</em> )</p>
<p>Mm. Or should I go... here?</p>
<p>( <em>buzzes twice</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Jack</strong>: <em>Charlie, don't look at the kid, look at the board. Actually,</em> one quick look at the kid again, so I can get a screen grab.</p>
<p>Gross, no, man, no.</p>
<p>No? No?</p>
<p>I-- No, not you. Sorry.</p>
<p>Talking to the voices in my head, so...</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Jack</strong>: <em>Stay on the board.</em></p>
<p>Yup. Yes.</p>
<p>Don't mind my friend. He's schizophrenic.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>shutter clicks</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Jack</strong>: <em>Got it.</em></p>
<p>Go eh...</p>
<p>( <em>buzzes once</em> )</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>I took your little castle-y thing.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Suck on that <em>boy!</em></p>
<p>If he does, let me get another screen grab.</p>
<p>Shut up, dude. That's gross, man.</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) Uh-oh, uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p>Uh, sir, may I have a word with you?</p>
<p>Um, absolutely not, because I'm in the middle of watching a game of chess.</p>
<p>Uh, there is no alcohol allowed on the premises.</p>
<p>What? Wh-What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like, I got to drink wine or something?</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) No alcohol at all.</p>
<p>At a sporting event? ( <em>scoffs</em> ) That's crazy.</p>
<p>Fine, dude. Here you go. ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Frank, I'm gonna have to find some way to sneak beer in here.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Dude, are you still here? Go away.</p>
<p>I gave you the beer, man.</p>
<p>Now, as you're both aware, I have a foolproof system for attracting a woman.</p>
<p>But I also have a foolproof system for attracting a man.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Aw, awesome.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>Shh, shh.</p>
<p>Shh. Shh.</p>
<p>Okay. Now, it begins with me setting you both up with nice, normal dates.</p>
<p><em>You will begin by greeting them with the traditional pleasantries.</em></p>
<p>Very nice to meet you, Patrick.</p>
<p>Kyle, it's a pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure's all mine.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>I'll be nearby, of course, to make sure nothing goes awry.</em></p>
<p>Step one.</p>
<p>S-- suppress your instincts.</p>
<p>See, your first instinct is going to be to try to make yourself seem awesome to him, but that's wrong.</p>
<p>'Cause this isn't about you.</p>
<p>This is a man we're talking about.</p>
<p>It's always about him.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So, you're going to...</p>
<p>I-- inflate his ego.</p>
<p>Make him feel like he's awesome, he's funny, he's the most interesting person in the room.</p>
<p>You're the most interesting person in this room.</p>
<p>Uhp, uhp, uhp. Hi.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) Hello.</p>
<p>I just wanted to come over and introduce myself.</p>
<p>I'm-I'm the manager of the establishment.</p>
<p>Yes, I was just saying that he's the most interesting man in the room.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, it's-- I-I caught that, actually, and I wanted to say to you that, uh, Mac does, in fact, know everyone here, which he would, of course, have to in order to have said something like that.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) So, it's meaningful.</p>
<p>Now, once your man's feeling important, you're gonna show him that you...</p>
<p>N-- need his power.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>See, every man's greatest fear is that he's a... pussy.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>You need to make him feel powerful.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. ( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Oh... man. I just can't seem to get this open.</p>
<p>Do you think you could help me out?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>( <em>soft chuckle</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, this is really on tight.</p>
<p>( <em>grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, are you-are you being serious?</p>
<p>Oh, Christ, Bozo, give it back to me. I'll do it.</p>
<p>Wai-- No, no. Uh, no. Yeah, it's-- You can't.</p>
<p>You can't. You couldn't.</p>
<p>No one could, because these bottles...</p>
<p>( <em>clears throat</em> ) are all, uh... they're defective and un-openable.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's been a recall, actually. See?</p>
<p>It's-it's impossible. Nobody could... ( <em>straining</em> ) ...get these open today. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>You know what? You do look very, very strong.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) You mind giving this one more shot for me?</p>
<p>Let's see if you can get it.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Now that your man's feeling powerful, on top of the world, you must... rip it away from him.</p>
<p>You're going to N-- negate his power.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this needs to be subtle.</p>
<p>A man's ego is... fragile.</p>
<p>The goal here is to make him feel that he may be a... tad bit inadequate, in comparison, maybe, to a former lover.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But don't lay it on too thick.</p>
<p>Mm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Subtle.</p>
<p>I used to fuck LeBron James.</p>
<p>( <em>snorts, coughs</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Now, even if things have gone a little off the rails at this point, we can get things back on track with a classic.</p>
<p>E-- engage physically.</p>
<p>Hey-o.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you got to make sure that your physical engagement is appropriate to the environment, okay?</p>
<p>Your demeanor wants to remain elegant and classy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Mm. Got it.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm grabbing your ding-dong.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, yeah. That's, uh...</p>
<p>And now for the final step, the most profound move of the entire system.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>D.</p>
<p>"Do you want a tissue?"</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You see, with this one simple but profound question, you instantly transport this man back to a time when he was a tiny, snot-nosed little bitch who depended on the most important person in his life for absolutely everything.</p>
<p>The person who inflated his ego, who made him feel powerful, but also powerless.</p>
<p>The person whose validation he's been seeking his entire life.</p>
<p>Guys, the way to make a man fall in love with you is to make him feel like you are... his mommy.</p>
<p>Well, it's getting late.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should probably call it.</p>
<p>I have, uh, one thing that I'd like to ask you.</p>
<p>Um... do you need a tissue?</p>
<p>Do you need a tissue?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You need a tissue.</p>
<p>You need a tissue.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, really? Ah...</p>
<p>Ah, just... That's-that's embarrassing.</p>
<p>( <em>blows nose</em> )</p>
<p>Hang on, all right, stop it.</p>
<p>There we go. Come here.</p>
<p>There we go. Now my little man is all ready for his day.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>Before, they wanted nothing more than this date to be over. But now they can't help but ask...</em></p>
<p>Hey, um, any chance...</p>
<p>Would you want to...</p>
<p>...do this again...</p>
<p>...sometime?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>And there you have it.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is... the SINNED system.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Oh, ho!</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Crazy creepy, though, Oh, yeah, very creepy. with all the mom stuff, and... the name's a little heavy-handed.</p>
<p>Yeah, took a-took a lot to get there.</p>
<p>It's not as clean as the DENNIS system.</p>
<p>Well, but listen, the DENNIS system-- that's a system for getting a woman.</p>
<p>This is a system for getting a man, and that's why SINNED is actually...</p>
<p>DENNIS backwards.</p>
<p>( <em>Dee gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God! ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>That's amazing.</p>
<p>How-how did that line up like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, what are the odds, though?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, wow.</p>
<p>What do you-- The odds of what?</p>
<p>What are the odds that the steps to the system would be DENNIS backwards and that they would spell out the word "sinned?"</p>
<p>High! High. 'Cause I made it up.</p>
<p>Oh! Yeah, he did it on purpose.</p>
<p>Oh, my... He made it up.</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>What's up, guy--</p>
<p>You know what, I got to say, I am, I'm still, like, buzzing from last night.</p>
<p>Got a little hairy there for a second, didn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we pulled it off.</p>
<p>We sure did!</p>
<p>We really did.</p>
<p>We really did.</p>
<p>Success.</p>
<p>All right, so talk to me, when are those second dates?</p>
<p>Ooh, yeah, no, that's not happening.</p>
<p>What do you mean, that's not happening?</p>
<p>Well, I got home last night, and, I, uh, found myself real horny, so I popped a couple of Mommy's magic beans and headed over to Kyle's house.</p>
<p>Roofies. I roofied myself. Yeah, not 100% sure if we plowed or not, but I do know I got this.</p>
<p>You stole his phone.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I'll be honest, Aw... the details are a bit hazy, still, but I do know I stole somebody's phone.</p>
<p>And you?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm not doing it either.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Okay, but I have a good reason, Dennis.</p>
<p>I have a really good reason, 'cause I'm not a-a rapist and a thief like Dee is. I'm-I'm just a boy in love.</p>
<p>I'm just a boy in love with Johnny, and I realized that I-I have to be with him.</p>
<p>Well, no, see, that's-that's the thing--</p>
<p>Johnny doesn't love you. He doesn't even like you.</p>
<p>You don't know him.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You don't know him.</p>
<p>I know him better than you.</p>
<p>Do you? Because I am him.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I invented Johnny as a means of getting you out of the apartment when you were irritating me.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Okay, like, when "Johnny" sent you out to go get those soft-shell crabs, you remember that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. And he was supposed to meet you, but he didn't. He ghosted you, right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And so, you came sauntering back in the house and all depressed, and I was like, "Well, I tell you what, buddy, I'll eat the soft-shell crabs. They are my favorite."</p>
<p>And I said, "Oh, my God, what a coincidence because they're-they're Johnny's favorite, too."</p>
<p>Yeah, because I am Johnny.</p>
<p>Then who's Dennis?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, if you're Johnny, then who-- who's you?</p>
<p>I'm Dennis! I've always been Dennis.</p>
<p>L-L-Let me-- This is gonna make it all clear. This is my phone, Don't want to get into this-- and when I push a certain button...</p>
<p>Wait, hold on. H-Hold on a second.</p>
<p>( <em>buzzing</em> )</p>
<p>What, what?</p>
<p>Johnny's buzzing me. I got-- Look.</p>
<p>No, I pushed the button.</p>
<p>I haven't heard from him in a while, and I'm going to the motel. I got to meet him.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Mac, it's not Johnny. I pushed the button on my phone--</p>
<p>I can't engage with you on this right now.</p>
<p>I got to-I got to go see Johnny.</p>
<p>Dennis! Dennis. I need your help, man.</p>
<p>I need your help, big-time.</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>I am done helping people.</p>
<p>Dude, we're so close, man. We're in the finals.</p>
<p>Yeah? I don't care.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And there's no way I'm gonna be able to sneak a restaurant buzzer in now.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? You're not gonna stop talking.</p>
<p>So, I-I'm just...</p>
<p>Yes-- No, I'm not, because, Dennis, I need your help. Look, I've I don't care. been controlling Frank using the restaurant buzzer, okay?</p>
<p>Wait a-wait a-- whoa, what...</p>
<p>And it's the perfect plan.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Sorry, did you just say you've been... controlling Frank like a pawn in a game?</p>
<p>Like a puppet?</p>
<p>Uh, I didn't say any of those words, but yeah.</p>
<p>I've been-I've been controlling Frank, uh, in chess, yes.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>And Frank's been aware of the puppetry the entire time?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course. He's in on it. But dude, it's over, right?</p>
<p>Unless you know a way I can sneak something into this tournament that vibrates.</p>
<p>I think I may have a way, but, uh...</p>
<p>Frank's not gonna like it.</p>
<p>Dee.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>Got any more of those magic beans?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>'Cause we're gonna need to turn the lights out.</p>
<p>( <em>door opens</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Frank! Frank, get up!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Wow, what...</p>
<p>Wake up! Wake up, man!</p>
<p>We're late!</p>
<p>Okay. What?</p>
<p>We're gonna miss it, dude.</p>
<p>( <em>door closes</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>reporters clamoring</em> )</p>
<p>Move. No, out of the way.</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank. Cutting it pretty close there, pal.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Ah, feel like I got to take a shit.</p>
<p>What? You got to sh-- Don't shit, don't shit.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, no, no. There's no time for that.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I'm not ready for this.</p>
<p>No, listen to me, listen to me. You are ready.</p>
<p>Everything you need is already inside you.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Move. No, out of the way.</p>
<p>( <em>heart beating</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p><em>The excitement here is palpable.</em></p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: <em>At last, the moment we've all been waiting for, Mr. Reynolds is about to make his first move.</em></p>
<p>( <em>clapping</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You got this, Frank!</p>
<p>You got this, man!</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) I don't know what I'm doing.</p>
