<p><strong>Announcer ( <em>over P.A.</em> )</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Philadelphia Zoo.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that...</p>
<p>Damn it. Where is Frank?</p>
<p>I'm not missing this lion feeding.</p>
<p>Oh, lions are cool, man.</p>
<p>For sure. But, you know, the best exhibit's the meerkats. You know?</p>
<p>Meerkats!</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, man, you know, they have those bubbles, you know, where you can pop your head up out of the ground and look around.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're looking around.</p>
<p>It's like you are a meerkat.</p>
<p>No, I'm not waiting for Frank. I'm-I'm just gonna go in.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>'Cause I-I don't want to wait here for the guy.</p>
<p>I know. But I think we should...</p>
<p>I really feel like we need to stick together.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Dee, will you calm down? She got lost at the zoo when we were seven. It's fine.</p>
<p>I-I got trampled by wild animals at the zoo when I was seven.</p>
<p>Sheep.</p>
<p>At the petting zoo.</p>
<p>Goats!</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about that. Okay, guys?</p>
<p>Because modern technology has figured this out for us.</p>
<p>We're all connected now.</p>
<p>That is why I started this group text chain.</p>
<p>You know? So we can stay in constant communication.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna hit up Frank real quick, and we'll find out what's up.</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis mutters</em> )</p>
<p>Guys, this way, nobody is gonna get lost, because the texting keeps us all on the same page.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, see, there you go.</p>
<p>Frank's five minutes away.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, everybody knows that "five min away" actually means 20 minutes away, okay?</p>
<p>I'm not missing this live feeding, okay?</p>
<p>Dude, why the big deal about watching a-a lion eat a pile of dead meat?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no. Wrong. Alive.</p>
<p>Okay? Quite alive, I assure you.</p>
<p>That's a thing? Zoos do that?</p>
<p>That's a thing.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Dennis has a boner? He does?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, he doesn't.</p>
<p>Well, goddamn it, he did.</p>
<p>I did. It's gone now.</p>
<p>Uh, do we have to do this whole texting thing?</p>
<p>I mean, Dee's already annoying.</p>
<p>She's always been annoying, Charlie.</p>
<p>That's why we ditched her when she was seven.</p>
<p>You... ditched me?</p>
<p>Oh, shut up, Dee. Shut up!</p>
<p>God, don't make this all about you.</p>
<p>I'm-I'm going in. I don't-I don't want to wait.</p>
<p>Well, then I'm gonna go with you, 'cause I don't want to get ditched again.</p>
<p>Fine. Whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll catch up with you.</p>
<p>Look, look, look.</p>
<p>And just text us when he gets here.</p>
<p>Who? Frank?</p>
<p>Yes, Frank. Who else would we be talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Text us when Frank gets here!</p>
<p>Huh?!</p>
<p>Frank. Text...</p>
<p>Frank! What? Text us! Text us!</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Text us when Frank gets here!</p>
<p>I can't... I can't... You know what?</p>
<p>I can't... Let me just... I'm-a...</p>
<p>Text 'em now.</p>
<p>I'm gonna text y... Check your phone!</p>
<p>I'm gonna text you!</p>
<p>( <em>phone clicking</em> )</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>choir singing African music in foreign language</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) God, I'm so thirsty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that's the cinnamon in the churro.</p>
<p>That'll make you thirsty.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) You know what?</p>
<p>I'm gonna... I'm gonna update the group.</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Why are you texting that?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I just wanted to, uh, update the group on my status.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's, like, a sexual thing, man.</p>
<p>That means you're thirsting for something, which means you're horny for it.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Dennis is funny with the texts, man.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Aw, come on. Too late, Dee.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. Where is Frank?</p>
<p>I'm just... You know what? I'm just gonna text him again, 'cause I don't know what the hell's going on.</p>
<p>Where you be?</p>
<p>( <em>exhales</em> ) Huh.</p>
<p>What does that mean? He's...</p>
<p>It's a dancing woman, a smiley face and a gun.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I know what that means.</p>
<p>He's stuck behind a woman driver and he wants to shoot himself.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right. Well, I'm just gonna update everybody.</p>
<p>"Late." ( <em>smacks lips</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, but come on, man.</p>
<p>You keep sending updates with no new information.</p>
<p>No, no, I'm just keeping the whole group updated the way a meerkat might.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a meerkat's efficient in how it updates.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? Like, one little chirp, it can warn a whole group of, like, an eagle or whatever.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to, like, chirp over and over and over again, you know?</p>
<p>I-I'm sorry, a-are you schooling me on meerkat knowledge?</p>
<p>Seems like I have to.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, is that right?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, smarty-pants, they don't chirp. They chirrup.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? You think you know a ton about the meerkat?</p>
<p>Well, did you know that the alpha pair will scent-mark the subordinate to show that it's the leader?</p>
<p>If they find the weak one, they start pissing all over it.</p>
<p>Yes. Of course I know that, Charlie.</p>
<p>We watched the same documentary.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm not the one that passed out halfway through and scent-marked all over himself.</p>
<p>I drank a case of beer, man.</p>
<p>So did I.</p>
<p>I also drank a case of beer, and I didn't piss myself.</p>
<p>( <em>mutters</em> )</p>
<p>All I'm saying is you don't have to text, like, every three seconds, you know?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Aw, goddamn it. Where is Frank? I just...</p>
<p>You're gonna text it again?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm gonna...</p>
<p>I just got to make sure everybody knows.</p>
<p>It just means that you're... you want... you're horny. Oh. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Ah, Dennis g... Dennis nailed it.</p>
<p>What-what does that mean?</p>
<p>A peach is a butt.</p>
<p>You're horny for a butt. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>I'm-I'm horny for a butt?</p>
<p>'Cause you're gay.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hey-o!</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late. I had...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>...had to get a bag of bananas so I could taunt the gorilla.</p>
<p>It took you two hours to get bananas?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I was stuck behind that woman driver.</p>
<p>I thought I texted you that.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got that.</p>
<p>Let's just go inside.</p>
<p>I...</p>
<p>Aw, c... Too late, Dee. Come on.</p>
<p>She sucks.</p>
<p>Pick up the pace with it, you know?</p>
<p>She sucks.</p>
<p>I texted a peach.</p>
<p>I already did that, Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. There it is.</p>
<p>You know, speed's very important in comedy texting, Dee.</p>
<p>If it looks like you thought about it for a while, it's pretty lame.</p>
<p>Yeah. I know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ooh, you know what I'll do? I'll do a fist. Right?</p>
<p>So it's like he's thirsty for a fist in the butt. ( <em>snickering</em> )</p>
<p>I don't think anybody's gonna get that.</p>
<p>You know? Plus, the moment is long gone. I mean...</p>
<p>( <em>snorts, laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Goddamn it. What...</p>
<p>No, that... I was wrong. That was funny. I...</p>
<p>Oh, Dee.</p>
<p>Well, you guys are too fast on this thing.</p>
<p>Don't answer. I got this.</p>
<p>Let me just...</p>
<p>I can... No, no! No.</p>
<p>But you're... Okay, go, go.</p>
<p>I got it, I got it. Okay.</p>
<p>What's a... funny thing I can...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Stop. I...</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Well, I mean...</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
<p>Quick. Concise. Job done.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No confusion.</p>
<p>( <em>choir singing African music in foreign language</em> )</p>
<p>All right. Sea lions, here we are.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right. Where are they?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Mm?</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>He said in front. He's not in front.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Exhibit ent...</p>
<p>Entrance?</p>
<p>Oh, come on. I got to go rescue these guys at the exhibit entrance? Excuse me, sir?</p>
<p>Sir? Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, h-how long do we have till the lion begins feeding?</p>
<p>Uh, we're five minutes out.</p>
<p>Five minutes out? Okay. Thank you, thank you. All right.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. I don't want to get lost.</p>
<p>No, I will not adjust my gait to accommodate your weird insecurities about sheep.</p>
<p>It was a goat, and it was a lunatic.</p>
<p>Its eyes were going in every direction.</p>
<p>Oh, were they? Fascinating.</p>
<p>Tell me more!</p>
<p>He pounced on me, and then all of his friends moved in for the kill.</p>
<p>Ooh! Terrifying. Ooh!</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>It was so scary!</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>hippopotamus grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>shit, he's-he's having fun without us.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no. Mac, that's sarcastic.</p>
<p>If he was having fun, it would have an exclamation point.</p>
<p>I'm gonna de-escalate. I'm gonna de-escalate.</p>
<p>Probably pissed he can't find us.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>That's not g... What it means is that he's already given the information and he doesn't want to have to repeat himself.</p>
<p>So you got to scroll up and see.</p>
<p>So, what... Scroll up.</p>
<p>Scroll up.</p>
<p>Dennis hates to repeat himself.</p>
<p>Well, let's find what he's...</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>"Went to C lions."</p>
<p>Oh. shit.</p>
<p>Dude, do you think he went to the sea lions or he went to go see the lion?</p>
<p>Ooh...</p>
<p>Oh. I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know. Let me ask.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah, yeah, I...</p>
<p>What'd you get wrong there?</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Sea. ( <em>chuckles</em> ) Um...</p>
<p>Dude, just let me, all right?</p>
<p>Well, it's-it's the predictive te...</p>
<p>It's better... it's better with pictures.</p>
<p>Went to sea lion or...</p>
<p>Lions.</p>
<p>...see a lion?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh. He's mad.</p>
<p>Oh, no, but...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, it's got an exclamation point.</p>
<p>That means it's happy.</p>
<p>No, it's all...</p>
<p>He's-he's screaming at you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's all caps.</p>
<p>It's all caps.</p>
<p>Screaming?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's not good.</p>
<p>That's...</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>What-what is...</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>What does that mean? I don't know. Dee-Dee sucks, man.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>She-she sucks.</p>
<p>All right, watch this.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>How about that with the eggplant?</p>
<p>Oh. Ooh. We're coming.</p>
<p>All right, let's go.</p>
<p>All right, let's go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Oh, yeah. "We're coming."</p>
<p>Charlie made it work.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Nice. Nice.</p>
<p>Idiots went to the wrong exhibit.</p>
<p>All right, let-let-let's get back there.</p>
<p>I don't want to miss anything. Come on.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Well, stop walking like...</p>
<p>( <em>panting</em> ) Hey, pal. How's it going?</p>
<p>Uh... where's the lion?</p>
<p>Are we close? Are we close?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you just missed it. Yeah, he's fed.</p>
<p>He's back in his cage.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>He ate the kill? He-he devoured the kill?</p>
<p>And I wasn't here?</p>
<p>No, the feeding. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You just missed it. It was awesome.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Man, you said we were five minutes out.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that was only ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>C-Correct.</p>
<p>No, but nobody does it that way.</p>
<p>The five minutes means 20 minutes, man. You can't...</p>
<p>It's the whole reason I'm here!</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>Hey, man. You missed it. It was awesome.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>( <em>choir singing African music in foreign language</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Frank mutters</em> )</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Oh, oh. He's thanking us for something, so that's good.</p>
<p>Dude, how are you so bad at this, man?</p>
<p>He probably missed the feeding. He's blaming us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>shit. You think?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>No. Hold on.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna send him something real quick and make sure everything's all good.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>He says he's great, so we're fine.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>He's screaming at you, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Screaming?</p>
<p>Dude, this whole texting thing is your idea, and you don't know how texting works?</p>
<p>No, he's... He just did it in all capitals.</p>
<p>That's screaming.</p>
<p>That's a scream.</p>
<p>That's what you do when you're screaming.</p>
<p>That's not scream...</p>
<p>This is just all one big misunderstanding due to the sea lions, all right? I know what to do.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna speak from the heart.</p>
<p>Let me just text s-something from the heart that he's gonna understand, something a little bit...</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Smell good.</p>
<p>Not really normal to the... if I...</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Is there a...?</p>
<p>What rhymes with "limber"? What rhymes with it?</p>
<p>Hinder.</p>
<p>How do you not get "timber"?</p>
<p>Timber.</p>
<p>Timber. And...</p>
<p>Oh. Salutations.</p>
<p>And send.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ah, dude.</p>
<p>So, let's just give him a chance.</p>
<p>He's probably gonna take some time and respond to...</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>Frank mumbles</em> )</p>
<p>No, he responded.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, "K."</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) You're dead to him.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's blowing you off, man.</p>
<p>"K" means "okay."</p>
<p>He is pissed, dude.</p>
<p>"K."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He is...</p>
<p>"K" means "okay."</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He didn't even bother to read your thing!</p>
<p>He just sent "K."</p>
<p>How could he possibly read that whole...?</p>
<p>He read it!</p>
<p>He is pissed off at you.</p>
<p>Dennis is the fastest reader in America.</p>
<p>Can we just...?</p>
<p>( <em>ringtone playing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, now he's calling me.</p>
<p>He's calling?</p>
<p>Oh, good. Good, good, yeah.</p>
<p>You could just text, but no. Call me, call me!</p>
<p>I want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Okay. You're gonna like this.</p>
<p>Uh, what is that?</p>
<p>I called him the "F" word.</p>
<p>It's a bundle of sticks. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>No. Dee, no. You can't do that. That's not funny.</p>
<p>Okay, y-you can't say that word.</p>
<p>I didn't say the word. I did the pictures.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter. That's offensive, okay?</p>
<p>And it's off-putting, and it's not a good color on you.</p>
<p>Blue? You're gonna go blue? Don't go blue.</p>
<p>That tells me that you're just not funny at all.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Frank nailing it again.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>What's so funny about what you did?</p>
<p>Well, it works on two levels, Dee.</p>
<p>It-it says that, uh, Frank's on fire and also that, uh, Mac is a raging flamer, which is still totally acceptable, for now.</p>
<p>I have an idea. I have an idea. Check this out.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I'm joking that maybe we should get the Jew lawyer and have an arbitration about what words we can and can't use to describe Mac's sexuality. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>both laugh</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis laughs loudly</em> )</p>
<p>Cool! Super funny and not the least bit anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>You get it! You get it.</p>
<p>Should we just get out of here?</p>
<p>Let's do that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, hold on.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Well, okay, but hang on.</p>
<p>Wait, Dennis. Hey, excuse me.</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Dennis, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Where'd you go?</p>
<p>Where'd you go? Oh, no.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Why won't Dennis answer my calls?</p>
<p>Dude, who cares? Man, I'm so sick of this texting shit.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>It's like we're not even enjoying the zoo, man.</p>
<p>No see no animals.</p>
<p>"Missed your calls."</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, he...</p>
<p>He missed them.</p>
<p>He's lying to you.</p>
<p>He's avoiding you.</p>
<p>Look, can we just go see the meerkats?</p>
<p>Please? Let's just drop it.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank mumbles</em> )</p>
<p>We'll go to the meerkats. We'll have fun.</p>
<p>I want to go taunt the gorillas before they get fed and they're not hungry anymore.</p>
<p>Why do you even want to taunt a gorilla? What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, it's hysterical.</p>
<p>I sit there, eat a banana real slow, and he comes up to the glass, and he's banging on the glass like the dumb ape he is.</p>
<p>It will bang its hands bloody trying to get the banana.</p>
<p>How is that funny?</p>
<p>It's funny 'cause he can't get the banana.</p>
<p>All right, dude. You know what?</p>
<p>Go ahead. Go taunt the gorillas, all right?</p>
<p>But I'm going to the meerkats. I'm not going with you.</p>
<p>Suit yourself.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) All right, can we just go to the meer...?</p>
<p>What are you doing now?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>I'm just sending one last text.</p>
<p>You're gonna send another gi... Another gi...</p>
<p>Okay, it's gonna take a little bit of... Oh!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, he read that so fast.</p>
<p>He didn't read it at all!</p>
<p>I think...</p>
<p>Dude, he doesn't want to talk to you!</p>
<p>Can we just please go to the meerkats, dude?</p>
<p>No. You know what I'm gonna do?</p>
<p>I'm just gonna hang out in the bathroom for a while.</p>
<p>You're gonna hang out in the bathroom?</p>
<p>Yeah, for a while.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It's a gay thing, so you really wouldn't understand.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, it's, like, bathrooms at zoos are, like, big Grindr spots for closeted dads.</p>
<p>Dude, I know what's up here. You're ditching me, man.</p>
<p>You're-you're ditching me so you can go beg forgiveness from Dennis, dude.</p>
<p>It's so pathetic, man.</p>
<p>No, I am not, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's so pathetic, dude. Dude, you're no meerkat.</p>
<p>I am not!</p>
<p>I'm not doing th... I am a... Don't...</p>
<p>I'll tell you...</p>
<p>( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>You're not a meerkat.</p>
<p>Don't be...</p>
<p>Meerkats stick together, Mac!</p>
<p>Don't be like that, Charlie.</p>
<p>Of course I'm a meerkat, all right?</p>
<p>Bullshit! Then why aren't you hanging with me?!</p>
<p>I just want to go meet my needs real quick...</p>
<p>What about the needs of the group, Mac?</p>
<p>I'm gonna meet the needs of the group, Charlie, after that, but I just feel like... Are you... ( <em>liquid splashing</em> ) are you pissing on me?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, uh...</p>
<p>Direct eye contact?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>peeing continues</em> )</p>
<p>Your neck's very high.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm done.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>( <em>peeing stops</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>pants zip</em> )</p>
<p>Don't look at me.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>man vocalizing African music</em> )</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>Y-You came to talk to me.</p>
<p>Unless this is, like, a Grindr situation?</p>
<p>I came to piss.</p>
<p>Look, man, I know that you're mad at me, but when you said that thing about "C lions,"</p>
<p>Charlie was like...</p>
<p>Oh, that's a lie.</p>
<p>That's just a lie, because Charlie can't read.</p>
<p>All right, it was all my fault, but it was an honest mistake.</p>
<p>One thing, Mac.</p>
<p>I mean, I came here to see one goddamn thing, and you ruined it with your texting nonsense.</p>
<p>Yes, but I have some new information.</p>
<p>There's going to be another live feeding.</p>
<p>( <em>man singing African music in foreign language</em> )</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A goat is to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>I heard an employee in here. He was talking about it.</p>
<p>Now, I offered to blow him, but he was like, "Nah, I'm..."</p>
<p>Goat?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>That's some Jurassic Park shit. I like it.</p>
<p>But if you're gonna join me, you must follow my every command because, I swear to God, if you make me miss this one, too, I will feed you to the lions myself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>liquid splashing</em> )</p>
<p>Are you pissing on me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>peeing continues</em> )</p>

<p>Where's the big animal? The... Uh.</p>
<p>Ah. Annoying bird.</p>
<p>The what?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>No, it's just the phones are... they're so distracting.</p>
<p>Now, where's the big, dumb, you know, the ape, the animal?</p>
<p>The-the-the silverback?</p>
<p>Yeah, the dummy. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, well, that's Andy. Uh, Andy...</p>
<p>Andy the dummy.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ): Yeah.</p>
<p>He can be pretty shy.</p>
<p>Yeah... He can be... Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah. So, sometimes you have to look to find him 'cause...</p>
<p>Ah... Oh, excuse me.</p>
<p>What does this bitch...</p>
<p>What is she talking about?</p>
<p>I...</p>
<p>Hey! Hey!</p>

<p>( <em>goats bleating</em> )</p>
<p>So, this should be getting started any minute.</p>
<p>I'm gonna drop a quick pin because I think the guys are gonna want to see this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I got to say, something feels a little off to me a-about all this. W-Why are we in the exhibit?</p>
<p>That doesn't feel safe, you know.</p>
<p>And why are a bunch of children in the exhibit as well?</p>
<p>Yes, that does seem a little strange, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hi-hi. Uh, sir? Excuse me.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>When is the goat to be slaughtered?</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) When is the goat going to be fed to the lion?</p>
<p>Uh, my friend engaged in a sexual exchange for information and was told there was going to be a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Well, he tried but I said no.</p>
<p>Oh, that's...</p>
<p>It's not what you think.</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) I think there's been some miscommunication.</p>
<p>This is the-the petting zoo.</p>
<p>We're feeding the goats. We're not slaughtering them.</p>
<p>( <em>man singing African music in foreign language</em> )</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Dennis, I, uh...</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>No, it's fine, Mac.</p>
<p>This is all fine.</p>
<p>Why don't we just go to the next exhibit.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Cool. Yeah, I thought you were actually gonna be upset with me.</p>
<p>Dennis?</p>

<p>That was amazing!</p>
<p>I knew what you were saying by the looks on your faces.</p>
<p>Yeah. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. I-I felt connected to you for the first time today.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, that's what it's all about.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Dude, Charlie, that smile said a thousand words, you know?</p>
<p>It was like, "I told you so," but also, "I forgive you." I understood everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgave you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I could tell, Mac, by the look on your face, that you really were sorry about me having to miss that lion feeding.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I-I really appreciated that, bro.</p>
