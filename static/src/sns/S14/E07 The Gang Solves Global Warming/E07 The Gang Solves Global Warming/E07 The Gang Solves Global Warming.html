<p><strong>Radio DJ</strong>: 101.3 WNFY weather report. It's a scorcher out there, already 102 degrees. Residents are being asked to keep their thermostats at 76 degrees to conserve energy.</p>
<p>Ah, man, global warming. It's out of control.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's hot, baby.</p>
<p>Guys, we don't really have to worry about global warming, because... yes, is the Earth getting unbearably hot?</p>
<p>Of course it is. But it's all a part of God's plan.</p>
<p>Look, if God wants to roast us like turkeys, there's got to be a good reason for it.</p>
<p>That's easy for you to say; you're young.</p>
<p>You know who's gonna get hurt the worst?</p>
<p>Old people.</p>
<p>Old people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it's the younger generation that's gonna suffer... from global warming the most.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.</p>
<p>Listen, there's no reason to fight, okay?</p>
<p>We're actually living at a... very exciting time right now.</p>
<p>I mean, we're all finally in agreement... that climate change is real.</p>
<p>Well, yes,... the 25 years of climate science... finally caught up with my opinions,... and, Dennis,... when opinions meet facts,... that's when you get truth.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. But the good news is, hey,... for the first time I can remember,... we all have the same truth.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>That's nice, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>How 'bout that?</p>
<p>And, look, while some people are saying, "Look, we're staring down the barrel... of a global catastrophe here,"... that is true, but I think... if we all work together,... we can solve this problem.</p>
<p>Guys, we can beat the heat.</p>

<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Guys?</p>
<p>Feeling that? Nice and cool, huh?</p>
<p>Turned the AC way down.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know why... we're wasting our AC on strangers.</p>
<p>No, Frank, we're not wasting it.</p>
<p>No-no-no-no.... We're adapting to climate change.</p>
<p>People are animals.</p>
<p>When push comes to shove,... there's no "together."</p>
<p>No-no-no, see, listen.</p>
<p>By-by-by cranking the AC... down below the recommended,... uh, settings, and getting the word out... that Paddy's has the best AC in town,... we're actually helping our business... and helping the environment.</p>
<p>No, that doesn't work. Shame's better.</p>
<p>Like I do with my shoes,... you know what I mean?</p>
<p>How would I know what you mean?</p>
<p>My shoes that are made out... of recyclable materials.</p>
<p>I did a whole Instagram Story about it.</p>
<p>Talking about how great the shoes are,... making people feel stupid... for not having them.</p>
<p>You know, you remember.</p>
<p>Who the fuck do you think... is watching your... What?!</p>
<p>Not-not one person on Earth is...</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?... Plus, how is there any plastic... left in the ocean after they used it... to cover your gargantuan feet?</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckling</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, big feet. Hey, guys, though,... we got a little bit of a problem.</p>
<p>Uh, there's, like, a,... I don't know, like, a backup... of the water lines or something.... The ice machine's broken.</p>
<p>We don't have any ice.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Okay, well,... just, uh, call the store... and have them deliver some ice.</p>
<p>And make more waste by having... a big smoke-spewing truck... deliver ice to us when we could... just simply get off our asses... and go get it ourselves? Hey, guys,... listen, I just wanted to... talk about the importance... of not only talking the talk,... but also walking the walk.</p>
<p>Oh. As I'm saying that,... it's reminding me... I'm loving my new eco-friendly shoes.</p>
<p>See there? Not only... am I helping the environment,... I could also get some free swag... if I keep it up, play my cards right.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: That's awesome.</p>
<p>You're such an awesome eco-warrior.</p>
<p>And since you want to walk the walk,... why don't you walk to the... store and pick us up some ice?</p>
<p>I just might.</p>
<p>Okay, then do it.</p>
<p>Maybe I will.</p>
<p>Get out and go!</p>
<p>Could even do an Instagram... Story about it on my way there.</p>
<p>Oh, super cool!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis and Frank</strong>: Go!</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Go, go and go... and go and go and go and go and go, go, go and go.</p>
<p>Fine!</p>
<p>Charlie, come with me;... I need someone to video me... so I look more professional.</p>
<p>I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>We'll do a Story about Purina,... tag them, and get you... a free case of cat food.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Did you see that, Frank?</p>
<p>If you incentivize somebody... to make the right decision,... you can get them to do... whatever you need them to do.</p>
<p>All right, what about me?... Where's my incentive?</p>
<p>Well, uh, how about... we lower that AC even more... and see if that helps you?</p>
<p>How would that help me?</p>
<p>Frank, what's the temperature... at which a certain body part's... small, smooth muscle cells contract,... thereby decreasing... the surface area of the skin,... causing that certain body part... to protrude in an unusual fashion?</p>
<p>65.7 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Make it so.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>Nipples, Mac. Uh, nipples.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>( <em>Bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>Son of a bitch charged me $40... for a bag of ice, Charlie.</p>
<p>They... he's taking advantage... of this heat wave,... jacking up the prices.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's smart.</p>
<p>So what's going on with the feet?</p>
<p>I see you limping here.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what?... These shoes, they are,... they're the worst.</p>
<p>Well, my feet... are all blistered and swollen.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>But they're so cute and totally on-brand.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Don't do the Story now.</p>
<p>Well, you told me... to shoot candid moments... that seemed honest.</p>
<p>I said staged moments... that looked candid and seemed honest.</p>
<p>All right, well, can we just... walk back to the bar? Let's go.</p>
<p>I-I don't know.... I honestly don't think I can walk back.</p>
<p>My feet are killing me.</p>
<p>Let's take the bus, then.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how... much pollution a bus causes?</p>
<p>I don't know. Uh, three?</p>
<p>Three?</p>
<p>Three what?</p>
<p>Pollutions?</p>
<p>All right, we're not...</p>
<p>I-I'm not a scient...</p>
<p>I'm not a scientist.</p>
<p>We're not... You're not a scientist.</p>
<p>I get it.... We're not taking the bus, though,... because buses are wasteful and... more importantly disgusting.</p>
<p>You're just all crammed on... there with a bunch of mongrels... breathing directly into your mouth.... There's no room. No.</p>
<p>Plus it's the future, Charlie.</p>
<p>We can just take a rideshare.</p>
<p>Rideshare? Why... What?</p>
<p>Yeah. It's when a bunch of people... get the app,... and then y'all take the same... vehicle to different places.</p>
<p>Same vehicle, diff... so, like a bus.</p>
<p>Fine, but it's not a bus, it's a car.</p>
<p>So less room.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>'Cause if we just take the bus...</p>
<p>We're not taking a bus, Charlie!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Taking the rideshare. Come on.</p>

<p>It's getting hot as hell.</p>
<p>I did. I did,... but there's too many people here.</p>
<p>I can't offset the body heat.</p>
<p>Hey, we got a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I... yeah, I saw that.</p>
<p>What's with all the water, man?... What's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, that is probably from... the ice machine breaking down.</p>
<p>The water got backed up and... maybe diverted over here.</p>
<p>But that's not what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>The fish factory guys... heard about the AC.</p>
<p>Now they're hanging out.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to go near them.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they're covered in fish parts.</p>
<p>They probably smell like shit.... Go kick them out, Mac.</p>
<p>Uh, well, they go to my church.</p>
<p>And if I kick them out,... then they'll tattle on me to God.</p>

<p>No. No, I actually don't... want hot air from the outside... blowing all over the place,... but thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right, guys.</p>
<p>Listen, we got another problem,... all right?</p>
<p>We're running out of glasses... and I can't run the dishwasher... 'cause it's too big of a power suck.</p>
<p>It's gonna kill the AC.</p>
<p>I got a fix. We got this stuff... back when we were gonna... have the Memorial Day party,... but then we had to cancel... it because of the blizzard.</p>
<p>Oh! You bought the... yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>That's working together, baby.</p>
<p>It's plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p>The Lord provideth again!</p>
<p>No, Mac! No. The Lord not provideth.</p>
<p>Frank provideth.... He's the one who bought the cups.</p>
<p>Frank provideth.</p>
<p>That... well, the Lord... provideth the snowstorm in May... that allowed us to get the cups now.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>See? It's all a part of his divine plan, Dennis.</p>
<p>And that's locked in, so we're good.</p>
<p>Okay, so all we have to do is nothing?</p>
<p>No. No, because, uh,... we have free will, Dennis,... which means that, um,... we have to take the necessary steps... to make sure that that... plan comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Which is predetermined.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter what we... do if it's all predetermined.</p>
<p>You see how your argument... doesn't make any sense?</p>
<p>Uh, that's correct.... But it doesn't have to make sense,... because that's where the faith comes in.</p>
<p>Right? I have faith that... what I'm saying makes sense.</p>
<p>Okay, so even if it doesn't make sense,... your faith makes it make sense.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Got it. Okay, so there's no way... to have a rational... conversation with you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Climate change affects us all.</p>
<p>Okay? We're all in this together.... All right?</p>
<p>We need to work together,... and we can still make a profit, okay?</p>
<p>Don't worry. Just let me think... about how to make this work.</p>
<p>Well, think fast,... because it's getting hotter in here... and people are gonna start dying.</p>
<p>I got an idea. I got an idea.</p>
<p>Look, the-the music,... it's very, very up-tempo.</p>
<p>What if we throw a couple... slow jams in here, all right?</p>
<p>Drop the body heat down a notch.</p>

<p>I didn't account for all... the increased sexiness.</p>

<p>Let's not stop at all.... Let's just chill out.</p>
<p>We'll chill out for a second,... you know what I mean?</p>
<p>We'll chill out. We'll slow things down.</p>

<p>It's fine. W-We... But if we adapt,... we'll keep the party going... for a long, long time. So who's with me?</p>
<p>( <em>Crowd screaming</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Glass shattering</em> )</p>
<p>I got the booze!</p>
<p>( <em>Crowd cheering wildly</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God. That bus was hot as shit.</p>
<p>The third bus was the hottest, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's those local buses.... We should've just gotten off... at the express and walked, but that's...</p>
<p>It's all the buses.</p>
<p>They're bad.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Please tell me the ice didn't melt.</p>
<p>Uh, no,... but somebody ripped a hole in the bag... and stole it. Yeah.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>How did you not notice that?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>My back must have gone numb... from the ice on my back.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, no. No. I can't go all the way... back to that store. I can't do it.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, that's too many vehicles.</p>
<p>But how are your feet feeling, though?</p>
<p>Oh, I got to say, though,... Charlie, the feet are feeling real good.</p>
<p>Whatever you made...</p>
<p>I'm pretty proud of that shoe.</p>
<p>Uh, you should be.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's the medical sponge, which is...</p>
<p>I don't want to hear any of the details, though.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I'll spare you.</p>
<p>Okay? Thank you.</p>
<p>Whoo. So what's the plan now?</p>
<p>I got one last idea.</p>
<p>Hey, oh! Ice!</p>
<p>We got ice.</p>
<p>What's going on in here?... Who are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh, these are our friends... from the fish factory. What's up, guys?</p>
<p>They're actually pretty good... dudes once you get to know them.</p>
<p>Yeah, nice c... not like the... people we had in here before.</p>
<p>They were terrible. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, well, what happened to the party, though?</p>
<p>People were animals, just like I said.</p>
<p>All right, well,... while you guys were in here... destroying the environment, I got ice,... with barely a carbon footprint.</p>
<p>And I also made a... pretty sweet Insta Story... to spread the word and... shame my followers.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>What up, Dee's Nuts?</p>
<p>Just another important... Insta message for you.</p>
<p>Don't forget to reduce, reuse and...</p>
<p>I'd rather drive six Hummers... than smell your shit breath, loser!</p>
<p>Well, these shoes suck.... They're terrible.</p>
<p>My feet are all blistered.... What are you doing? Don't...</p>
<p>You're the stupid idiot! Okay?</p>
<p>No. You put my ice bag down...</p>
<p>I'm not putting the ice down!... I'm taking the ice!</p>
<p>I'll give your money this time.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of my store.</p>
<p>But you try and gouge me again,... you son of a bitch,... I'll gouge your eyes out!</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> ): There you go.</p>
<p>Last time you get recycled.</p>
<p>Hope a bird chokes to death on you.</p>
<p>( <em>Shouts</em> ) I hate the bus!... Oh, you're disgusting!</p>
<p>I can't stand being near... you low-life degenerates!</p>
<p>( <em>Spits</em> )</p>
<p>Ah. Yeah. Not tipping you either,... so don't even ask.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And cut.</p>
<p>Okay, stop saying "and cut."</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie.</p>
