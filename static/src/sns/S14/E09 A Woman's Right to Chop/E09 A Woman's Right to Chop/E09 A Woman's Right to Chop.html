<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: My God, for the love of God, there's two more of 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I mean, it's giving me indigestion.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, man.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I'm tired of looking at it.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And where are they even coming from, dude?</p>
<p>It's that new salon that opened up down the street.</p>
<p>I thought it was gonna be good for business, but this is hard to look at.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I don't even understand why you guys give a shit.</p>
<p>Why do we give a shit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These women have mutilated themselves, Dee.</p>
<p>It's an abomination.</p>
<p>Once you go down that road, it's, you... there's no turning back.</p>
<p>It's just, like, the dumbest hat, too, like...</p>
<p>A hat? Are you talking about their hair?</p>
<p>That's hair? Oh, my... I thought that was, like, a little comedy hat or something.</p>
<p>That's their actual hair... Why would anyone do that?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Wait a second. Poppins?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, it's Poppins!</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ) Poppins! He came back!</p>
<p>My dog came back!</p>
<p>How the hell is that dog still alive?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mac, why don't you just put that poor thing out of its misery?</p>
<p>Put him down? What, are you crazy?</p>
<p>This is my dog, Dee. I love him.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Well, he doesn't love you.</p>
<p>Comes around every three or four years, eats a bunch of batteries or whatever, takes a giant dump on the floor, and then leaves again.</p>
<p>Dee, Poppins comes and goes as he pleases 'cause that's his right as a male.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Women are never gonna get that.</p>
<p>They'll never get it.</p>
<p>Yep. We are hunter-gatherers, Dee.</p>
<p>And if we decide to leave, we're gonna leave.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause that's nature. That's tradition.</p>
<p>That's bullshit.</p>
<p>Traditional roles are ridiculous, and they're made up by men.</p>
<p>If I want to have a baby and then abandon that baby, I have the right to do that.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>A woman abandoning her child?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, that's awful, Dee.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's cheap.</p>
<p>And it's not natural. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like those haircuts. I mean, they... that's traditionally a man's look.</p>
<p>Women can't just adopt it.</p>
<p>You know? I mean, look, it's one thing for, like, a 60-year-old art critic to do it, but, I mean, these are young, sexually viable women making themselves no longer sexually attractive to me, and that upsets the natural balance of things.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: What? No.</p>
<p>If women want to get short, ugly, lesbian haircuts, then they deserve to do that because it's their body and, therefore, their choice.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna make it about that?</p>
<p>You know what? Killing babies is wrong, Dee, and God forbids it.</p>
<p><strong>Frank ( <em>groans</em> )</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>Here comes another one.</p>
<p>( <em>Burps</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> ) It's too much!</p>
<p>â™ª</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: ( <em>Sighs</em> ) I'm telling you, man, something is wrong with Poppins.</p>
<p>His belly's all big. I've never seen him so run-down.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not like he's never been sick before.</p>
<p>You remember the time he drank an entire pot of coffee?</p>
<p>That wasn't good.</p>
<p>No, this is different, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is... Look, check this out.</p>
<p>( <em>Air horn blows</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That's not good.</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, it's just like...</p>
<p>( <em>Air horn blowing</em> )</p>
<p>Where'd you get the air horn?</p>
<p>Oh, I-I picked it up at the hardware store when you were grabbing coffee.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Why?</p>
<p>I want to jump-start Poppins's system.</p>
<p>You know? But it's not working. Maybe if I do it longer?</p>
<p>I'll do it super long, huh?</p>
<p>Uh, you know what?</p>
<p>What if I feed him my coffee, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yep.</p>
<p>You blast him with the air horn, a-and that might wake him up.</p>
<p>Oh, and maybe I'll scream into the other ear.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah. Give it a whirl.</p>
<p>Please don't.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, am I not doing it right?</p>
<p>Do you want to give it a go?</p>
<p>Uh, no, I don't. And, yes, you're doing it correctly, I just prefer you not feed your dog coffee and blow an air horn repeatedly into its ear canal.</p>
<p>Hey, look, if that doesn't make this dog less sleepy, nothing's gonna.</p>
<p>Well, to be clear, uh, sleepiness is not Poppins' problem.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Is it a tumor?</p>
<p>( <em>Exhales</em> )</p>
<p>If it's not, could you say it in that really funny Arnold Schwarzenegger voice that's, like, so funny?</p>
<p>( <em>Accent</em> ): "It's not a tumor."</p>
<p>You know what I mean? And that always, like... Yeah.</p>
<p>"It's not a tumor."</p>
<p>It's funny when he says it, too.</p>
<p>( <em>Regular accent</em> ): Unless it is a tumor, and then it's not gonna be funny.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Well, uh, there's good news and there's bad news. Right?</p>
<p>Uh, the good news is that Poppins is pregnant.</p>
<p>Wait. Poppins is a girl?</p>
<p>Oh, you didn't know your dog was a female?</p>
<p>Oh, nah, I-I could never get underneath that hind leg to check.</p>
<p>You don't want to try to get under Poppins.</p>
<p>I mean, one time I tried to give him a belly scratch and he bit my thumbnail clean off.</p>
<p>He's a monster.</p>
<p>Uh, "she."</p>
<p>Say what now?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>"She-She's a monster."</p>
<p>I can't believe that Poppins is gonna be a father.</p>
<p>A mother.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A mother?</p>
<p>He is?</p>
<p>Hmm... Okay. Uh, do you two not understand gender?</p>
<p>No, I mean...</p>
<p>Well, we don't really do gender at our bar anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Like, gender's so, like, old school.</p>
<p>Like, I-I don't identify...</p>
<p>Um, I'm so sorry to tell you, uh, the bad news, is that given Poppins' advanced age, I'm afraid that she most likely will not survive the delivery.</p>
<p>He won't?</p>
<p>Again, she.</p>
<p>And, uh, yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ): I-I don't think I've ever seen a dog this old.</p>
<p>It's a miracle that she was even able to get pregnant, so when she gives birth, she will most likely die.</p>
<p>Well, you got to kill those babies, then.</p>
<p>( <em>Inhales</em> ) Uh...</p>
<p>What? Dude, what the hell?</p>
<p>I thought you were all pro-life and everything.</p>
<p>I am, but this is different. This affects me.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm so sorry, but we don't perform that procedure here.</p>
<p>We can talk to a, like, a doctor, not a nurse.</p>
<p>That's a good idea. Do you have any doctors here?</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>I'm a...</p>
<p>Let's go. We'll go find a man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Got some information for you.</p>
<p>You're gonna want this information.</p>
<p>Great hair. Keep the hair the way it is.</p>
<p>Very important information, honestly.</p>
<p>Keep your hair the way it is. It's really great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh... Hi!</p>
<p>Hi... G-Going the wrong way.</p>
<p>You going in here to get the... Yeah.</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>Check this out: um, uh, did you know that hair only grows about six inches over the course of an entire year?</p>
<p>Did you realize that? Isn't that mind-blowing?</p>
<p>Think about that for a second. You know?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Here. Grab that for me, if you will.</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's something else.</p>
<p>You can't get your hair cut. You don't want to do that.</p>
<p>Um, now I'll tell you something.</p>
<p>With luxurious locks like yours, it could take, oh, three, four years to grow back to its current length. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, if it ever grows back.</p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p>Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>If that doesn't convince you, there's more. Um...</p>
<p>Listen, are you familiar with the television series Felicity, starring Keri Russell? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, this is Keri Russell right here.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Look at her.Beautiful. Gorgeous.</p>
<p>Beautiful girl. Yeah, gorgeous.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Millions of adoring fans, hit television show, you know, and then she went and did this.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look at that. Oh, God.</p>
<p>What a mess.</p>
<p>Shocking, isn't it?</p>
<p>Still pretty.</p>
<p>With this one tragic decision, Keri Russell a-alienated all of her fans, she got her show canceled, and, man, she was never heard of ever again.</p>
<p>( <em>Belching</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, but Keri Russell works all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, now, does she still play women?</p>
<p>Look, leave me alone, creep.</p>
<p>Probably in a cape or something.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, hold on.</p>
<p>You're about to make a huge mistake, lady.</p>
<p>You don't want to do this. Man.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>She got in.</p>
<p>What is this? What are you guys doing?</p>
<p>One got away.</p>
<p>We let her go.</p>
<p>Well, Dee, we are educating the public is what we're doing.</p>
<p>We're trying to help these women.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Will you please leave these poor women alone?</p>
<p>They're clearly bored and lonely and-and-and needing to do something extreme in order to make themselves feel special.</p>
<p>Listen. Take this one for example.</p>
<p>You don't get a monkey cut like that unless you're broken inside.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?</p>
<p>No, sweetie, I'm talking about you.</p>
<p>I'm using you as an example.</p>
<p>I support your choice to look like whatever kind of primate or simian species you choose, because it is your choice.</p>
<p>Okay? You know what?</p>
<p>Go full baboon, girl. I support you.</p>
<p>No. Dee, Dee, you're not being rational.</p>
<p>Can you at least acknowledge the fact that men should have some say in what women do with their hair? I mean, for Christ's sakes, we're the ones that have to look at it all day!</p>
<p>No, Dennis. I won't acknowledge that.</p>
<p>You have no say. In fact, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm gonna get the haircut.</p>
<p>( <em>Belching</em> )</p>
<p>Don't do it, Dee. You're gonna, you're gonna look hideous.</p>
<p>I know I will. I don't have the face or the body to support a haircut like that, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because I can.</p>
<p>Because I choose to, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>You don't do it.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>You do not do it. You go back to the bar.</p>
<p>I command you!</p>
<p>Dee.</p>
<p>You're not being serious enough.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>One monkey cut, please!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>You... you bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, so, what we'd like you to do is kill the dog puppies, if you could.</p>
<p>( <em>Whispers</em> ): Hey. Don't-don't say "kill," though.</p>
<p>Uh, sorry, murder them, if possible?</p>
<p>Say, uh... Uh, no, say, uh...</p>
<p>Uh, sorry, my friend has a...</p>
<p>"...terminate the embryos."</p>
<p>To terminate...</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you could terminate the puppies' embryos?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what? Come on. Let me just-let me...</p>
<p>Uh-huh. Sorry.</p>
<p>Hang on one second. My friend wants to talk to you.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll do it.</p>
<p>Yes, hi. Yes, we-we need you to perform this dog abortion, and if you don't, my dog is gonna die.</p>
<p>And he-he-he's not gonna be able to survive the...</p>
<p>Yes, I'm-I'm aware that a boy dog can't have puppies.</p>
<p>What's with this? I...</p>
<p>I... Yes. Look, it's a little bit confusing because he used to be...</p>
<p>Look, there was a transition at some point, all right?</p>
<p>He had a sex change.</p>
<p>We see past gender at our bar.</p>
<p>And I don't... They hung up.</p>
<p>That's the tenth one.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>The problem is we-we can't get any doctors on the phone.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You know? You're always talking to a secretary.</p>
<p>I know, it's just...</p>
<p>Puts you on the phone with some other female secretary, and it's like...</p>
<p>And honestly, I tune them out, because I can't... they get so high up in the register.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p>She's gone too far! She has no idea of the ramifications of what her actions... ( <em>Belching</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Whoa. Frankie.</p>
<p>Take it easy, buddy. Your valve's getting all worked up.</p>
<p>( <em>Mutters</em> )</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunting</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, your valve's acting up... You know what?</p>
<p>Here, here... eat some cat food.</p>
<p>Come on, settle down.</p>
<p>( <em>Stammers</em> )</p>
<p>You-you got to get that valve down, man.</p>
<p>You got to calm that down, all right?</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>Neutralize it out with the cat food.</p>
<p>Let me have it.</p>
<p>All right, walk me through what's happening here.</p>
<p>It's Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, she's gonna do it. She's gonna cut her hair off.</p>
<p>( <em>Belching</em> ): Dennis... put me in charge... of making sure she doesn't go through with this madness.</p>
<p>Ooh, Frankie, that valve is bad, man. That is backed up.</p>
<p>You-you drinking enough beer, bud?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay. Let-Let's get you another beer or something.</p>
<p>Let me have a brew, and pop me another can of this cat food.</p>
<p>It's working.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We got to settle that valve down, buddy.</p>
<p>( <em>Whoops</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, you know anybody that'll do a dog abortion?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a guy.</p>
<p>Yeah. There you go. Take a look.</p>
<p>You seriously want to buy me a car as long as I don't cut my hair?</p>
<p>Yeah, and we should look at the convertibles.</p>
<p>I want the wind blowing through those long, beautiful locks of yours.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with a haircut and everything to do with you controlling my body.</p>
<p>It's got everything to do with a haircut, Deandra.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's me when I was young.</p>
<p>I was like Samson.</p>
<p>I had hair down to my butt crack.</p>
<p>I looked like a Greek god.</p>
<p>You look like a bridge troll.</p>
<p>Well, the point is, I cut it all off.</p>
<p>I-I needed the money and I read an ad... for a toupee company that said they would give good money for real hair, so I bought in.</p>
<p>But I shaved it all off to the nub. It never grew back.</p>
<p>And-and, plus, when I think about it, I get a... ( <em>Belches</em> ) pain in my stomach and I... gastronomical.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>And I burp.</p>
<p>That's not how hair works. Or gastrointestinal tracts.</p>
<p>I want to show you something else.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p>There what is, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's my old hair.</p>
<p>He-He's given it a good home.</p>
<p>He takes care of it.</p>
<p>Probably better than I would've taken care of it myself.</p>
<p>Wha...?</p>
<p>I come by time to time to check it out, see how it's doing.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Ah, here he comes.</p>
<p>Don't-don't say anything, because I don't want to make it feel bad.</p>
<p>Hey, how are you?</p>
<p>Hey, here's my guy.</p>
<p>Hi. How you doing?</p>
<p>How you doing, Frankie?</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Very nice to see you.</p>
<p>I love this guy. He's bought, like, five cars off of me.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>I hope you're using that money for high-end shampoos and conditioners.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ): S... Always with the shampoo jokes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Uh, so, anyway, you here to buy something today?</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>No! No.</p>
<p>I-I... you're not buying me a car, Frank.</p>
<p>You can't control me with your cars and your threats of male pattern ( <em>Belches</em> ): baldness.</p>
<p>That-that was an unrelated burp.</p>
<p>I had four beers on the way here, I'll have you know.</p>
<p>I'm getting the haircut. I'm getting it.</p>
<p>Don't do it, Deandra. You'll regret it!</p>
<p>I'm telling you!</p>
<p>What was that all about?</p>
<p>( <em>Exhales</em> ) Just trying to save a life.</p>
<p>Oh. The wind's kicking up.</p>
<p>You better get inside. I don't like to see her struggle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You sure this is the place?</p>
<p>Yeah. This is where Frank said to meet the guy, so...</p>
<p>What up?</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Z.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How you doing, man?</p>
<p>What you boys up to?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Uh, we're waiting on a doctor that Frank's hooking us up with.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's me, homie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You're a doctor?</p>
<p>Straight up.</p>
<p>Come on. No, you're not.</p>
<p>bitch, you don't think I'm a doctor?</p>
<p>I was a medic in Desert Storm.</p>
<p>I did Doctors Without Borders, I saved mad lives.</p>
<p>See, you racist. That's what the problem is.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, Z. I didn't have any idea.</p>
<p>That's impressive, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ): bitch, I'm just playing with you.</p>
<p>I ain't no motherfucking doctor.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ): Are you serious?</p>
<p>I do still feel bad, though.</p>
<p>I feel terrible.</p>
<p>I feel bad, too, because I feel like I was exposed.</p>
<p>Lesson learned.</p>
<p>Lesson learned. That was good.</p>
<p>I was... My racism was exposed.</p>
<p>But I do fuck with dogs, so tell me what's up.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Good.</p>
<p>So, uh, Poppins is sick.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there's a bunch of babies in there.</p>
<p>Oh, snap. Okay. Right.</p>
<p>Now, the vet said that if he gives birth, he's gonna die.</p>
<p>Oh, so you want me to scoop them babies out so your dog can die.</p>
<p>Uh, n-no. The, the opposite, actually.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You want me to scoop them puppies out and chuck 'em and then put your dog out its misery.</p>
<p>Uh, no. No.</p>
<p>No. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>No, uh, we want you to kill the babies and keep this dog alive.</p>
<p>Okay, word. I can get with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, is there a version, like, where no dog dies?</p>
<p>Yo, son, that's hard to tell.</p>
<p>I made dogs make babies, but I ain't never taken no babies out the dog.</p>
<p>Oh, you're a breeder.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's why Frank hooked us up.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I breed dogs.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I groom dogs. I fight dogs.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Oh. Mm.</p>
<p>I ain't never abort no dog, but we can get it done.</p>
<p>Poke around in one of them trash cans, try to find an Allen wrench.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie inhales sharply through teeth</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm starting to think this is a mistake, man.</p>
<p>I don't think he's qualified to do this.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I don't know what else we're gonna do, man.</p>
<p>I mean, we got to save Poppins.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, shit. Wait. Who's this?</p>
<p>Oh... Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Charlie...</p>
<p>I think this is the real Poppins!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: That's Poppins, isn't it?</p>
<p>I was wondering why I didn't have to pop this dog's eye back in its socket.</p>
<p>That dog has a very solid eye. It was very mysterious why...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah, look how dirty he is.</p>
<p>Oh, look. Oh, look at this. He came back.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: He's getting all nose-deep in, uh... in her goodies there, so...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Wait a second.</p>
<p>Charlie, maybe the puppies inside of this dog are Poppins's!</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Poppins is the dad?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh...</p>
<p>That is so cute.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: He came back to take care of his family.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>He likes to take... Oh, no, he did not. He did not.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: There he goes.</p>
<p>He wanted the blanket.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's a survivor. He's gonna take what he needs.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: He's gonna do what he's gonna do. Wow.</p>
<p>Bye, buddy.</p>
<p>Bye, Poppins!</p>
<p>All right. See you in a few years.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs heavily</em> )</p>
<p>All right. What are we gonna do with this piece of shit?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Listen here, you monster.</p>
<p>Okay, well, if you see her, can you call me? I'm just really freaking out. It's not like her at all.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) Um... I'm so sorry. Um, can I help you?</p>
<p>Yeah. ( <em>Clears throat</em> )</p>
<p>Yes. I'm sorry, the...</p>
<p>Your tears were unexpected. I, uh...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find it very arousing, tears, but this time, I wasn't...</p>
<p>I-I wasn't coming in-in that zone.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? So, I, uh, was...</p>
<p>I just wasn't ready for it. I was... I was gonna do a th...</p>
<p>I could switch gears, though. You want to do...?</p>
<p>We could do a... This could be an arousing thing. I...</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Right. Sorry. Uh...</p>
<p>Yeah, so, no. I... No, I came here with a plan, and, um...</p>
<p>Yes, I'm gonna stick to that plan, so... Sorry.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>I'd like a haircut, please.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Um, if you can just leave your name and number.</p>
<p>What do you mean "yes"?</p>
<p>I can...</p>
<p>Sorry. What?</p>
<p>I can make you an appointment if you leave your name and number.</p>
<p>Right on.</p>
<p>And I can give you...</p>
<p>You cut men's hair?</p>
<p>Yeah. We cut anyone's hair who needs it.</p>
<p>Good. As it should be.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>You won't outsmart me.</p>
<p>Sorry. I-I...</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna say that you only cut women's hair, and I was gonna claim discrimination to get you shut... it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I have to admit, you've-you've put me a bit out of sorts. I...</p>
<p>With the, with the, the tears and the... arousal and your face and words. I...</p>
<p>Can we start over? Uh...</p>
<p>Do you want an appointment?</p>
<p>No! No.</p>
<p>I-I... Because I don't want a-a-a haircut from a butcher.</p>
<p>All right? I'm not gonna get butchered like you've butchered these poor women's hairs.</p>
<p>Are you insane?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Look, I can be reasonable, okay?</p>
<p>I don't expect to save everybody from this, but I can save one person, all right?</p>
<p>My sister Deandra Reynolds.</p>
<p>She-she has an appointment here, and I want it stricken from the record.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) Look, you don't understand, okay? She's... she's my twin sister, all right?</p>
<p>Fr-From a genetic standpoint, I mean, her hair is just as much mine as it is hers, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I-I-I... I have every right to stop her from killing it.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't know what's going on here, but I don't have time for this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, you're very busy destroying young people's lives, aren't you?</p>
<p>Yeah. Doesn't surprise me it's reduced you to tears.</p>
<p>I'm crying because my dog is lost, asshole.</p>
<p>What's your dog look like?</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Well, this all worked out pretty well, didn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank belching</em> )</p>
<p>I can't believe how quick you gave up Poppins's puppies, though, you know? You didn't even think about keeping 'em.</p>
<p>Well, that's a lot of responsibility, Charlie, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>And plus, there's no doggy paternity test to actually prove that they were Poppy's puppies in the first place.</p>
<p>That's true, too.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: You know? But, hey, if Poppins wants to stop by and say, "What's up?" and, like, be a dad for while...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>...he's gonna.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or he won't.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's how I do. That's how I do.</p>
<p>But, guys, seriously, we got to stay vigilant, okay?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we were able to stop Dee from doing something horrible.</p>
<p>But, you know, we can't rest until every single woman is free from the choice of ruining their lives forever.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>So what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>I was thinking we use shame.</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p>It's a great motivator.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hello... oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>Frank burps</em> )</p>
<p>Oh! Aah!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Dee, what have you done?!</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I told you I was gonna get the cut!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But then I went into the salon, and the woman refused to see me.</p>
<p>She refused, she said, 'cause she was-she was doing some sort of trade in a dog-kidnapped situation. I don't know.</p>
<p>I ended up having to do it all by myself! That's right!</p>
<p>Listen, l-listen.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>It looks... terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I...</p>
<p>So bad.</p>
<p>I mean, really, really bad.</p>
<p>I know it looks terrible! The scissors were dirty, and they weren't even sharp.</p>
<p>But now it's done. It's done now.</p>
<p>There's no turning back.</p>
<p>What have I done? What have I done?</p>
<p>I've-I've forced my sister into a back-alley chop.</p>
<p>Guys, I think we-we need to realize something.</p>
<p>We're never gonna be able to stop women from doing whatever the hell they want with their own bodies.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And if we can't stop them from making stupid and selfish choices, then we need to give them a place to go to be stupid and selfish.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Where it's safe.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Where they won't do bullshit like this.</p>
<p>It's bullshit!</p>
<p>This is a bullshit haircut!</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>Okay, guys, here's something else, too.</p>
<p>I don't care about any of this, really, you know?</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, I don't care that much, either.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh...</p>
<p>Like, who gives a shit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I don't really care that much, either.</p>
<p>What?! No, you... No.</p>
<p>I don't know, it just... it's annoying, but I don't care.</p>
<p>We don't really care.</p>
<p>Why did you guys make such a big deal about it, then?</p>
<p>Well, uh, you know, that's, like, a guy thing.</p>
<p>Well, 'cause we're-we're used to being in charge, and we want to make sure that...</p>
<p>You did! You cared! You cared so much, and then I did it, and now what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>I care. I know what to do.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>I got a guy.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>How that wig feel, Dee?</p>
<p>Really good.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>It feels great. Thank you, Z.</p>
<p>Now, Dee, just remember that one day you may get a call from the woman who gave birth to that hair.</p>
<p>And, uh, I would consider some visitations.</p>
<p>Nah, she ain't got to worry about that.</p>
<p>I groomed that shit off a border collie.</p>
<p>Well, then you're good.</p>
<p>Hey. Might be some fleas up in there, but she good.</p>
