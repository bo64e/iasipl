<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I hope they don't show us some boring art house movie.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well, the title of the movie is terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, Focus Group? What is that?</p>
<p>Focus Group isn't the title of the movie.</p>
<p>We're in a focus group.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Charlie, we're here to watch, analyze, critique, and then, most importantly, judge whatever film we're gonna be shown.</p>
<p>Uh, these filmmakers... they need valuable input, and we have been carefully selected to provide it.</p>
<p>We were walking out of the mall, and they offered us Red Lobster gift cards.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you know, they've chosen wisely.</p>
<p>Uh, good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>I-I want to thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>Now, your feedback is very important to us.</p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm just a little confused here, 'cause I can't follow this movie.</p>
<p>The movie hasn't started yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, Moderator, not to worry.</p>
<p>I-I just want to assure you that your movie is in good hands.</p>
<p>Y-You've chosen wisely.</p>
<p>See, I, myself, am a prolific filmmaker.</p>
<p>In fact, while you don't thrill me, I might even consider you for one of my roles.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, um, but I'm not really a performer.</p>
<p>I'll get a performance out of you.</p>
<p>Uh, where will we appear in the credits?</p>
<p>In the credits?</p>
<p>Are we gonna be at the front?</p>
<p>Yeah, for our contribution.</p>
<p>Sort of the beginning of the film, or...?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you-you will not be.</p>
<p>But your opinions are valuable to us.</p>
<p>And you're gonna get a lot of them. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I'm already tearing this entire experience apart.</p>
<p>As am I.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p>Why don't we just start?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. Why don't you just go ahead and show us...</p>
<p>Let's just, let's see.</p>
<p>.. whatever piece of shit you're gonna show us, you know...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>.. so we can tear it apart and get out to Red Lobster?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, I'm hungry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the title of the film is...</p>
<p>Thunder Gun 4: Maximum Cool.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Really?!</p>
<p>Holy...</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>Dramatic music plays</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Loud whooshing</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Dramatic music plays</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Frank groans</em> )</p>
<p>Uh... uh...</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>I, uh... I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>I-I was totally lost.</p>
<p>Did they make Thunder Gun bad?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. So, that was our movie.</p>
<p>Now, clearly, the film is not done, but still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God!</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>Okay, so let's adjourn to the conference room to begin our session.</p>
<p>Let's get into it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's-let's fix it.</p>
<p>We can, uh, we can fix it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Okay, why don't we just break it down, act by act?</p>
<p>I'll play back a scene from the first act, and then we can discuss.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>♪ On down the line... ♪</p>
<p>Is your name John? John ThunderGun?</p>
<p>( <em>Thundergun sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Mm. Maybe once.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Ling.</p>
<p>This is my assistant Max.</p>
<p>I'm head of research and development for Com-Tec.</p>
<p>We need your help.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You got a bottle of whiskey that needs draining?</p>
<p>A man named Colonel Washington has stolen a formula from our lab.</p>
<p>In the wrong hands, this formula could be used as a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>A weapon that could destroy millions of lives.</p>
<p>We need it back, but he wants something from us.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? What's that?</p>
<p>Not what, but who.</p>
<p>( <em>Whooshing</em> )</p>
<p>I am Colonel Washington.</p>
<p>You know my reputation, so you'll give me what I seek.</p>
<p>Where is ThunderGun?</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>I am ThunderGun.</p>
<p>I am ThunderGun.</p>
<p>I am ThunderGun.</p>
<p>( <em>Chanting</em> ): I am ThunderGun!</p>
<p>I am ThunderGun!</p>
<p>I am ThunderGun! I am ThunderGun!</p>
<p>I am... ( <em>Yelling</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Machinegun fire continues</em> )</p>
<p>Okay, who has questions about the setup?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Me, me, me, me!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, let's start with you.</p>
<p>What's being set up?</p>
<p>Um... the entire movie.</p>
<p>The, uh...</p>
<p>So, the main characters, the story, the villain.</p>
<p>That's where you lost me. Who's the bad guy?</p>
<p>Well, Colonel Washington, obviously.</p>
<p>That's not clear.</p>
<p>In the old movies, the good guy wore white, the bad guy wore black, or was black.</p>
<p>Well, depending on the hero.</p>
<p>Right? It's-it's not a racial thing.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>It's about opposites.</p>
<p>See, I want the bad guy to be different than me so I know why I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>I hate people who are different than me.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yeah. Like Rocky one.</p>
<p>Bad guy was black.</p>
<p>Rocky II... another black guy.</p>
<p>Rocky III... different black guy with a mohawk.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in Die Hard, the bad guy was foreign, right?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>So I know why I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>People hate foreigners.</p>
<p>Right. - Yeah, we hate them.</p>
<p>Right? So in Thunder Gun, you don't have to do any reshoots, right?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Don't-don't make him black.</p>
<p>Just give him an accent.</p>
<p>What kind of accent?</p>
<p>What about Australian? That's pretty foreign.</p>
<p>No, that's not gonna work.</p>
<p>'Cause they're white.</p>
<p>No, because they're fun.</p>
<p>They're a very fun group of people, right? I mean...</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Try to hate an Australian.</p>
<p>It's impossible.</p>
<p>A bunch of rapscallions.</p>
<p>Little rascals.</p>
<p>Ooh, but French, though.</p>
<p>French. ( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Snobby. Snobby, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. You will definitely dislike him, but you won't fear him because he's most likely a pussy.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Right. - That's right.</p>
<p>Not scary. Not scary.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>When in doubt, go Eastern European, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's a classically evil part of the world.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>That'd work.</p>
<p>You know, let's talk a bit about the female character.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Do we have to?</p>
<p>I would love to.</p>
<p>The studio needs a female perspective.</p>
<p>What did you think of Dr. Ling?</p>
<p>Oh, I think she sucks. First of all, she comes in with a whole plan, like she's starting the movie.</p>
<p>So, you... you want the female characters to have less agency?</p>
<p>Yeah. Look, I feel bad enough about myself as is.</p>
<p>I don't need some super hot, funny, smart chick doing, like, roundhouse kicks and cracking computer codes to make me feel worse.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>No. No. I-I like the women of the old Thunder Gun days, right?</p>
<p>Bed 'em and dead 'em.</p>
<p>Look, first act, he meets a lady.</p>
<p>She's super hot, but I'm smarter, right?</p>
<p>And then he bangs her, and she gets dead.</p>
<p>And-and later on, he meets someone.</p>
<p>All right, this one's smart, I'll give her that, but I'm funnier. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He bangs her, she gets dead, and then, and in the end, he falls in love with an ugly one, and who cares about that? I don't care about that.</p>
<p>And then she gets dead, and that sets up for the next movie, and I'm all in.</p>
<p>Because all of the women are dead.</p>
<p>You know? No competition.</p>
<p>Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Right?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah. Write that down.</p>
<p>Women hate women.</p>
<p>I... ( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>I think the studio was trying to get away from the female character just acting as a plot device or a sex trophy.</p>
<p>Ah, but, yeah, why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>But that works.</p>
<p>Okay, let's move past this.</p>
<p>Let's take it into the second act with this next clip.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I dragged you into this, ThunderGun.</p>
<p>Don't lose hope.</p>
<p>We may get out of this yet.</p>
<p>But if we don't, I think there's something I should tell you.</p>
<p>We've met before.</p>
<p>Detroit.</p>
<p>Winter.</p>
<p>At a bar.</p>
<p>I went home with you.</p>
<p>The next morning, you were gone, and I never heard from you again.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I hurt you.</p>
<p>I never was good at being tied down.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) No, it's not that. It's just...</p>
<p>( <em>Exhales</em> ) My assistant.</p>
<p>You know Max.</p>
<p>Well, he's not just my assistant.</p>
<p>He's my son.</p>
<p>Are you trying to tell me...</p>
<p>Yes, John.</p>
<p>He's your son, too.</p>
<p>Max is your son.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>So, this is the midpoint twist.</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>Um, ThunderGun finding out he has a son.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>He has a son?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But how is this the twist?</p>
<p>I mean, because he's got a kid?</p>
<p>I mean, he's probably got a thousand kids, all the raw-dog loads he drops.</p>
<p>I don't know what "raw-dog loads" are.</p>
<p>Sorry for him. But my disgusting friend does bring up a good point.</p>
<p>I mean, every Thunder Gun movie has at least one very tasteful yet very erotic sex scene in it, and this had none.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>Yeah. I've... I've been waiting for the right time to bring this up, but I feel like we need to address the elephant in the room, no?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a big one for us.</p>
<p>Might as well.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about it.</p>
<p>Might as well. - Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so... where's the dong?</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie clicks tongue</em> )</p>
<p>The-the dong?</p>
<p>The dong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dong. The dong.</p>
<p>John ThunderGun has hung dong in every chapter of this saga.</p>
<p>And, well, I just watched 90 minutes of one, and yet not one hang.</p>
<p>Well, I think that the studio was thinking the gratuitous nudity was maybe a bit much.</p>
<p>fuck you.</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>This is exactly the type of Hollywood bullshit that America is sick of.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Hollywood's completely out of touch.</p>
<p>So out of touch with what people want!</p>
<p>Don't you want to give people what people actually want?</p>
<p>There's a bigger issue here.</p>
<p>Movies are different now.</p>
<p>You lost a sense of community.</p>
<p>Interesting. Go on.</p>
<p>Look, years ago, before the Internet, we would all go out to the movies together.</p>
<p>Yes. This is exactly what studios are trying to bring back. A-An event.</p>
<p>A place we can all go to enjoy as a community.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it used to be you give the creep-show at the window a couple of bucks, you could spend all day in there popping off.</p>
<p>And the joy of it was that there were people popping off at the same time.</p>
<p>I mean, n-not that you looked at each other. It was dark.</p>
<p>You weren't looking for the gay thing.</p>
<p>But it gave you a sense of something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p>Now, they... you know, got rid of all these movie theaters.</p>
<p>They're taking all the sex out of the movies.</p>
<p>And what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Go home, turn the lights off and pop off in front of Charlie?</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you talking about pornography theaters?</p>
<p>I'm talking about community, honey.</p>
<p>Right. E... Uh, yeah, even if the studios wanted to put back in the nudity, they couldn't because of the new rating.</p>
<p>Wh-What do you mean, the new rating?</p>
<p>Thunder Gun: Maximum Cool will be rated PG-13.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>( <em>Dee gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Now, that's quite a midpoint twist.</p>
<p>They did it! They did.</p>
<p>They ruined everything with this PC bullshit.</p>
<p>Straight white men can't have anything anymore.</p>
<p>Men? Look, don't forget white women.</p>
<p>We got completely passed over.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I can't follow any of this.</p>
<p>We're feeling a lot of outrage right now, you know, because we want something, and we know we deserve it, but we're not getting it.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>I'm mad, but I don't know at what anymore.</p>
<p>That's what it is!</p>
<p>( <em>All talking at once</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: That's what it is! I'm pissed!</p>
<p>Aah! I'm mad.</p>
<p>Listen, listen.</p>
<p>Our way of life is changing, and that's scary.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We don't want to change.</p>
<p>Oh, that makes me so angry.</p>
<p>Makes me mad.</p>
<p>I want to cling to the way things were, but they're done.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Let's run from this.</p>
<p>We'll run from it.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Do we have to, legally?</p>
<p>Guys, we can't run. Come on.</p>
<p>What's ThunderGun's slogan?</p>
<p>"No hesitation, no surrender, no man left behind."</p>
<p>Did we leave a guy in there, though?</p>
<p>Goddamn right we did, Charlie, and his name is John ThunderGun.</p>
<p>( <em>Martial music playing</em> )</p>
<p>Like it or not, we have a civic duty to uphold.</p>
<p>We owe it to ourselves, to ThunderGun, and to movie audiences all over the world to put a stop to this liberal, PC bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>But I think we have been selected for a cosmic reason here; to put an end to this.</p>
<p>To not pull our punches.</p>
<p>To save the dong.</p>
<p>Save the dong.</p>
<p>Save the dong.</p>
<p>Save the dong.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Oh, for God's sakes.</p>
<p>This is why you don't include women.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Are you kidding me?!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Don't you see that there was a rhythm?</p>
<p>Like a cinematic rhythm.</p>
<p>Oh, let's do it again.</p>
<p>Let's do it again.</p>
<p>No way. No way!</p>
<p>I get it now.</p>
<p>You-you can't...</p>
<p>You can't give women the zingers.</p>
<p>Now, you listen here, you goddamn Hollywood communist.</p>
<p>I live in Roxborough.</p>
<p>Again, I didn't make this movie.</p>
<p>Listen to me, listen to me. If you start to strip sex out of our communities, out of our culture and-and even our art, not only do you isolate people, but you create an oppression disguised as morality.</p>
<p>I mean, the... the Thunder Gun series has always been groundbreaking in so many ways, notwithstanding the recognition of an inequality that was present in cinema since its beginning days.</p>
<p>The objectifying of the female form. I mean, with Thunder Gun, a great injustice was rectified. Okay?</p>
<p>Fairness of the sexes.</p>
<p>A unification of the human condition.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, is this still about the flaccid penis you'd like to see?</p>
<p>You're goddamn right!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>We want to see it.</p>
<p>Yes, we want to see the man's dick, but...</p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is that it's no longer just about gratuitous boobs, it's also about gratuitous penis.</p>
<p>I mean, ThunderGun was about progress.</p>
<p>Right. Uh, I think we all can agree that public opinion has sort of turned against the idea of someone exposing themselves.</p>
<p>( <em>All groan</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, here we go. Here we go.</p>
<p>This is a different thing.</p>
<p>You're not understanding it.</p>
<p>See, ThunderGun didn't take his dick out to intimidate people.</p>
<p>He did it because he had accomplished his mission.</p>
<p>He wanted to kick back and call it a day.</p>
<p>He did do it once to intimidate someone, but that was the bad guy.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: It was the bad guy.</p>
<p>And it just so happened the bad guy was a female.</p>
<p>That was the best one. That was the best one!</p>
<p>That was funny.</p>
<p>It made me wish I had a dong that I could pull out to celebrate my accomplishments.</p>
<p>You know? Or maybe just feel the cool breeze gently tickle the shaft on a, on a crisp autumn morn.</p>
<p>I don't know, whatever men do to... to feel powerful.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>It really is. It really is.</p>
<p>Listen, Moderator, the point is this.</p>
<p>I mean, it used to be only, like, the hard-line conservatives, like the pearl-clutching types, were the only ones that were overly vocal and extreme in their policing of sexuality.</p>
<p>But now you got this, like, liberal wave of moral authority sweeping the nation.</p>
<p>You know, it's nuts. I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>If the conservatives had always run Hollywood, movies would have sucked.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? The art would have suffered.</p>
<p>So I guess the question we're asking is how will art fare under the oppressive thumb of this new liberal Hollywood moral PC elite?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know. It's tough to say.</p>
<p>But is that a world that we want to live in?</p>
<p>I say no.</p>
<p>I say give me dong or give me death.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, man, don't tell me what I can see and what I can't see.</p>
<p>So, uh, just to be clear here, they didn't make it PG-13 because of political correctness.</p>
<p>Oh, did they not?</p>
<p>No. No-no. They-they made it PG-13 because rated-R movies aren't making as much money anymore.</p>
<p>Because of streaming, and most importantly, piracy.</p>
<p>Piracy, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, and how have you all been viewing the franchise?</p>
<p>Oh, no-no, not through piracy.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In f... In fact, we, we-we saw the last installment of-of the franchise out in the theater.</p>
<p>We barely made it.</p>
<p>We barely made it.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, no-no, hold on, but Frank called in that bomb threat.</p>
<p>Oh, but-but that was okay, because remember, then we went home, and we, we saw it on the Internet.</p>
<p>Caught it online.</p>
<p>We caught it online.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. On that website that has all the movies.</p>
<p>So, that's... that is pirating.</p>
<p>No, no, no, pirating is stealing.</p>
<p>We didn't steal it, okay? We just downloaded it.</p>
<p>Uh, the website is called "MoviePirate.com."</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: And the other one is called, uh, "FreeMovies/Arrrgh."</p>
<p>Ah, I'm starting to see a little bit of a pattern here, because, uh, I also use one called "StolenMovies.free."</p>
<p>So... you're part of the problem.</p>
<p>Because of people like you, the studios felt like this was their only recourse.</p>
<p>PG-13 opens up a whole new market.</p>
<p>You're saying it's our fault that we don't get to see the dong?</p>
<p>You're coming in there changing everything, you know, getting rid of the dong, I mean, how is that even Thunder Gun anymore?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, th-they're changing it.</p>
<p>They're rebooting the entire franchise.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What d... What?</p>
<p>You guys didn't get that from the final scene?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, no, what...?</p>
<p>Okay. Let's review.</p>
<p>( <em>Wind whistling</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>I'm not gonna make it through this one.</p>
<p>We can both go detonate the hydro-fusion bomb.</p>
<p>No hesitation. No surrender. No man left behind!</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>No, Dad.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Sometimes in order to save something... you have to destroy something.</p>
<p>You'll need this to get out of here, son.</p>
<p>To continue our story.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Panting</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Dramatic music playing</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Inaudible</em> )</p>
<p>So, you see, they're rebooting the franchise for a younger audience.</p>
<p>The only people who are actually still going to see movies.</p>
<p>I did not get that.</p>
<p>Well, you haven't gotten anything the entire day.</p>
<p>Got to side with Charlie on this one.</p>
<p>I didn't get it. Now, wh-what was with the fire stick?</p>
<p>You mean the torch?</p>
<p>The one he passed to his son Max... as in Maximum Cool... and said, "You need to continue our story"?</p>
<p>It's the camera guy who screwed up.</p>
<p>'Cause ThunderGun, he fell into that fiery abyss, and for some reason, we're watching the kid...</p>
<p>Yeah, we wanted to go down into the volcano with John...</p>
<p>No-no, you guys don't get it. It's a cliffhanger. Yeah?</p>
<p>It's a cliffhanger. We're gonna find out what happened to John in the next movie, Thunder Gun 5...</p>
<p>Ooh...</p>
<p>Or, or there's a post-credit scene that we didn't get to see, yes?</p>
<p>No. No. There's none of that.</p>
<p>This isn't a cliffhanger. He's dead.</p>
<p>John is dead. Now we follow the son's story.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I don't, I don't want to.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No.</p>
<p>You don't have to think. I'm telling you, that's what it is.</p>
<p>ThunderGun fell into a volcano.</p>
<p>He died. And now his son Max becomes Thunder Son, the face of the franchise moving forward.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...</p>
<p>He has a son?</p>
<p>fuck, man! What?</p>
<p>How do you not get that?</p>
<p>It wasn't clear.</p>
<p>Reshoots. Reshoots. You got to reshoot.</p>
<p>Yeah, reshoots.</p>
<p>Reshoots to make the movie more clear...</p>
<p>No! That's not what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>We're out of time. That's it. That's... We're done.</p>
<p>But you're ruining our favorite movie! Uh... ( <em>Exhales</em> )</p>
<p>How can we save the movies that we love?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe if you actually go out to the theaters and pay to see them, then they will continue to make them.</p>
<p>Whoa! Oh, that's easy for you to say!</p>
<p>With your Hollywood liberal bank account!</p>
<p>Jesus! Who are you people?!</p>
<p>I... am ThunderGun.</p>
<p>I... am ThunderGun.</p>
<p>I... am ThunderGun.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis and Dee</strong>: I am... Thundergun.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Goddammit, Dee!</p>
<p>Dee...</p>
<p>How did you not feel that I was next and then you?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: There was a build to it, and then...</p>
<p>It's like, we're trying to give the woman the final thing, and she can't do it.</p>
<p>Okay, start it over.</p>
<p>You can't go back.</p>
<p>Start it over?</p>
<p>You see the problem with women.</p>
<p>Well, RIP ThunderGun, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah. What a waste.</p>
<p>I recorded that whole thing for nothing.</p>
<p>Dong-less!</p>
<p>Wait a second. You recorded the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Guys... hang on a second.</p>
<p>Do you remember what ThunderGun said?</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to save something, you have to destroy something.</p>
<p>And I think I know what we have to do to save Thunder Gun.</p>
<p>Destroy it?</p>
<p>Well, how are we gonna do that?</p>
<p>With a little help. From some pirates.</p>
<p>( <em>Dramatic music playing</em> )</p>

<p>No surrender.</p>
