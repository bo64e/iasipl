<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Now, keep in mind we've been locked in this parking garage stairwell for like 20 minutes, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Okay, so then we turn around and what do we see?</p>
<p>A scary homeless dude.</p>
<p>And I'm like, "Oh, shit!"</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm like, uh, you know, like, I'm like, "What do we-- what do we do?" you know.</p>
<p>And then Mac, he's just like--</p>
<p>"Just chill!"</p>
<p>And I'm like, "How do we chill, dude?"</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm all, "Oh, shit, he's gonna talk now."</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm-I'm all like, "How do you know he's gonna talk?"</p>
<p>And I'm like, "Because his mouth is opening."</p>
<p>And then he did talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then he goes-- he goes, "I-I'll let you out of the stairwell, 'cause I have the key, because I'm the security guard instead."</p>
<p>That's a cool story, huh?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, so, uh, just so I'm clear on the story that you just told.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was about you guys getting locked in a garage stairwell for 20 or so minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then a security guard came along, and the security guard let you out...?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but, I mean, it's how you tell the story that makes it good.</p>
<p>How you told the story was by far the worst part of the story.</p>
<p>You weren't even paying attention to us, dude.</p>
<p>No, all you're doing is playing on that stupid phone.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Why you rubbing on the phone?</p>
<p>Let me rub on it.</p>
<p>What-what are you doing?</p>
<p>No, no, no, hey, hey, Frank!</p>
<p>Get your greasy, fat sausage fingers off my touch screen phone.</p>
<p>This thing's new.</p>
<p>My fingers are not greasy.</p>
<p>Uh, you have four sausage links in your pocket right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don't touch the sausage links.</p>
<p>Why should I do that when I can let my shirt do the work.</p>
<p>Watch.</p>
<p>Mmm, no touching.</p>
<p>My, God, you're an animal.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Guess what, boners?</p>
<p>I just got a part in an M. Night Shyamalan movie.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm a featured actress, which means I'm going to be featured in the scene.</p>
<p>What's an M. Night?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>M. Night Shyamalan, the Indian filmmaker from Philly.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, this dude's a big deal, Frank.</p>
<p>He's like a true to life, uh, <em>Slumdog Millionaire.</em></p>
<p>He always puts some like awesome twist at the end of his movies to trick the audience.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, like-like in <em>TheSixth Sense,you find out</em> that the dude, um, in that hairpiece the whole time-- that's Bruce Willis the whole movie.</p>
<p>That's not the twist.</p>
<p>That's not the twist to that movie.</p>
<p>That wasn't the twist?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'll tell you about it later.</p>
<p>Watch it again. Watch it...</p>
<p>There were a lot of twists...</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You're going to need a very crafty agent to squeeze everything out of this slumdog.</p>
<p>I volunteer.</p>
<p>And I decline.</p>
<p>You are abusive and you smell like warm meat and I want you to leave me alone, 'cause this is really important for me.</p>
<p>This is important for all of us, okay?</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for Charlie and I to get M. Night our script.</p>
<p>Since when do you and Charlie have a script?</p>
<p>Since you walked in here and said you were in that movie.</p>
<p>We're great storytellers.</p>
<p>No, goddamn it!</p>
<p>No, come on, don't involve yourselves in this.</p>
<p>Dee, you involved us in this the second you walked in and told us about the movie.</p>
<p>You really shouldn't have done that, you really should...</p>
<p>Let's get to work!</p>
<p>ho!</p>
<p>ho! Let's get some beer.</p>
<p>Dude, we gotta get some beer.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa-- excuse me.</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Nonfat, sugar-free, vanilla soy latte-- three shots, no foam.</p>
<p>Also, why don't you go ahead and let me in here so I can start my vocal warm-ups.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Who are you again?</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds, featured actress. Yeah.</p>
<p>Reynolds? Great.</p>
<p>Could you send M. Night over, also?</p>
<p>Because I have a couple questions regarding the detes of my character.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Says you're a "featured extra."</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, featured extra, featured actress-- what's the difference?</p>
<p>Well, the difference is a featured actress usually auditions for the role, has lines, gets a trailer.</p>
<p>Whereas a featured extra is a person whose headshot we pull off a pile, has no lines and sits in that tent over there till we're ready for her. Okay?</p>
<p>Hmm, okay.</p>
<p>Ah-ah-ah-ah...</p>
<p>Where are we on the coffee situation?</p>
<p>Because it's early and I am hungover.</p>
<p>Go sit in the tent. Now.</p>
<p>This tent?</p>
<p>That one. Thank you.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>This is hard.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I mean, 'cause I want the movie to be big, right?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And, like, a box office smash.</p>
<p>And we want to put, like, a lot of meat in the seats, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm thinking, dude?</p>
<p>You know what I'm thinking?</p>
<p>Something that's happening in Hollywood that's, like, pretty cool.</p>
<p>They take an underrated actor, right, whose career's in a slump, and then they make him a star again.</p>
<p>That is awesome, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so who's the most underrated actor of all time?</p>
<p>It's Dolph Lundgren.</p>
<p>Correct. Why?</p>
<p>Well, because of his, uh, spiky hair.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>His ice-cold demeanor and his big muscles.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Okay. All right.</p>
<p>All right, so we have our actor.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, that's great.</p>
<p>Now we need a really great role for him.</p>
<p>You know what I was thinking?</p>
<p>Scientists are cool.</p>
<p>What if he's a scientist?</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, a muscular scientist.</p>
<p>I'm into that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As long as we don't cover up that body with a lab coat, bro.</p>
<p>No, dude.</p>
<p>He's wearing, like, a hot mesh tank top.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Now, does he, like, fight crime or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah-- he fights crime, uh, with his brain and his brawn.</p>
<p>Should we be writing this down?</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>Okay, brains...</p>
<p>Brawn.</p>
<p>Brawn.</p>
<p>Muscles... oh! Dude!</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I just got a Shyamalan twist to put in this bad boy.</p>
<p>Okay. Lay it on me.</p>
<p>What if this scientist runs around on all fours?</p>
<p>Why would he run on all fours?</p>
<p>It's a science experiment with a dog that goes absolutely haywire.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he wakes up with the ability to run around like a hound.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>We're not making the lead of our big-budget action movie half dog.</p>
<p>No, not half dog, he's all dog.</p>
<p>Then why are we casting Dolph Lundgren?</p>
<p>That will be the twist.</p>
<p>Dolph Lundgren will be the voice of this dog.</p>
<p>That's not a twist.</p>
<p>That's a completely different movie about a talking dog scientist with the voice of Dolph Lundgren.</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>What if it's a man with a few dog-like qualities like, uh, heightened sense of smell...</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Charlie.</p>
<p>Or licking, or, um...</p>
<p>There's no-- w-wait a second.</p>
<p>A heightened sense of smell?</p>
<p>What if he can smell crime?</p>
<p>What if he smells crime!</p>
<p>Dude, dude-dude-dude dude-dude-dude-dude!</p>
<p>What if he can smell crime before it even happens?</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude, that's amazing!</p>
<p>Smells crime before it even happens!</p>
<p>Yes, dude!</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>What if his entire head is just one big nose?!</p>
<p>Write that down!</p>
<p>I like that!</p>
<p>It's one big nose on Dolph Lundgren's body.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, no-no-no-no-no.</p>
<p>What are you two doing here?</p>
<p>Well, since you've declined my offer to be your agent, I've since taken on Dennis as a client.</p>
<p>Denis has that "I don't give a shit" attitude, which is perfect for Hollywood, right, Dennis?</p>
<p>I-I really don't care.</p>
<p>See? See?</p>
<p>Why do you want to be everybody's agent all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Because that's where the money is.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You just put things together, you sit back, you collect ten percent and you let the client do all the work.</p>
<p>Dennis doesn't give a shit, right?</p>
<p>Stop talking to me.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you can't just walk in here and get a part in the movie.</p>
<p>It's not how it works.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Can my client have a part in your movie?</p>
<p>Sure. Here.</p>
<p>Fill out this form.</p>
<p>You do it.</p>
<p>I'll do it.</p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, assistant?</p>
<p>Hey. Hi, when's somebody going to tell me what my part is?</p>
<p>What is your name again?</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds, I'm your featured extra.</p>
<p>Right, you're a corpse.</p>
<p>A corpse.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Like a zombie roaming through the streets, looking for dead bodies kind of corpse?</p>
<p>Nope. Like a dead corpse.</p>
<p>Just a dead corpse.</p>
<p>A lifeless body, lying in the street.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>We'll call you when we're ready for makeup.</p>
<p>I know, I know, but hold on a second. I have one more...</p>
<p>Don't be... Don't walk away from me.</p>
<p>He just... He'll be back.</p>
<p>Dee, Jesus, you come off so desperate.</p>
<p>Oh, Hollywood, Hollywood!</p>
<p>Hollywood!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>No, get out of here.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>We in a Hollywood situation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dennis just got a part in the movie.</p>
<p>Sweet, dude. Thump it.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Don't want to?</p>
<p>All right, so, uh... so where's the slumdog?</p>
<p>We're ready for him.</p>
<p>Oh, you finished the script already?</p>
<p>No, not exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, we, uh... we didn't want to get locked into anything, so we came up with a pitch instead.</p>
<p>It's more like a series of ideas in no particular order, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll work out the kinks later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you hit a brick wall, huh?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Yeah. Dennis can help you with that.</p>
<p>He is good at coming up with awesome words.</p>
<p>You know, I wouldn't rule it out.</p>
<p>You have to sign him on as a producer. That okay?</p>
<p>Dennis, you want to be a producer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>All right, we'll work out the detes later, man.</p>
<p>Bro, maybe we got to find, like, a cooler place.</p>
<p>Could we get a place with some A/C on?</p>
<p>Let's have a meeting.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's have a meeting and some A/C, man.</p>
<p>Leave it to me.</p>
<p>All right, you guys got 30 seconds. Blow my mind.</p>
<p>Blow his mind.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, all right, guys, guys, it's the prequel to <em>The Sixth Sense.</p>
<p>The Fifth Sense--the sense of</em> smell.</p>
<p>(ominous music plays)</p>
<p>Imagine a super-ripped, super- smart scientist in a mesh tank top... named Doctor...</p>
<p>Dolph Lundgren.</p>
<p>No, that's-that's not his name.</p>
<p>It's... He's played by Dolph Lundgren, but that's not the character's name.</p>
<p>No. It could be the character's name.</p>
<p>No. That's...</p>
<p>A doctor played by Dolph Lundgren named Dolph Lundgren?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's confusing to me.</p>
<p>That's...</p>
<p>No. More confusing than making up an entirely new name for a person?</p>
<p>That's gonna confuse people.</p>
<p>I'm taking over.</p>
<p>I'm taking over.</p>
<p>You are losing me.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. All right, all right, all right...</p>
<p>Imagine a super-smart, ripped scientist played... by Dolph Lundgren...</p>
<p>Played...</p>
<p>...who-- after a terrible accident in his lab-- blows off his nose...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>After reconstructive surgery, he soon realizes that he smells something that stinks.</p>
<p>Crime...</p>
<p>This doctor smells crime?</p>
<p>Possibly also runs around like a hound.</p>
<p>No, he doesn't run...!</p>
<p>I have to say don't rule it out-- it's possible.</p>
<p>I didn't agree to that.</p>
<p>It's not in any of our notes.</p>
<p>He might run around like a hound.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Okay... all right, first things first.</p>
<p>You guys got to type some of this shit out and get organized, for Chrissakes.</p>
<p>Get your shit together.</p>
<p>Come on, I mean, that's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of the story, uh, clearly it's brilliant.</p>
<p>It's amazing...</p>
<p>Great idea, brilliant idea.</p>
<p>...and I like it a lot, but there is one critical element that's missing.</p>
<p>It needs a sexual punch-up.</p>
<p>We need to get a female lead character in there that Dolph can bang throughout the whole movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I kind of hate women, though.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I feel like they just slow action movies down, too.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, Mac, see, you're dead wrong on that.</p>
<p>You're dead wrong.</p>
<p>See, one of the problems with Shyamalan's movies is that they lack a certain eroticism.</p>
<p>What if we were to bring... an incredibly hot but skeptical female lab partner into the mix?</p>
<p>And then that way, whenever Dolph's not out busting heads because he smelled crime, he's back at the lab performing outrageous sexual experiments on her supple young body.</p>
<p>Now, here's the twist, and there is a twist.</p>
<p>We show it.</p>
<p>We show all of it.</p>
<p>Because what's the one major thing missing from all action movies these days, guys?</p>
<p>Full penetration.</p>
<p>Guys, we're going to show full penetration, and we're going to show a lot of it.</p>
<p>(chortling)</p>
<p>I mean, we're talking, you know, graphic scenes of Dolph Lundgren really going to town on this hot, young lab tech.</p>
<p>From behind, 69, anal, vaginal, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl-- all the hits, all the big ones, all the good ones.</p>
<p>And then he smells crime again.</p>
<p>He's out busting heads.</p>
<p>Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration.</p>
<p>Smells crime, back to the lab, full penetration.</p>
<p>Crime, penetration, crime, full penetration, crime, penetration...</p>
<p>And this goes on and on, and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends.</p>
<p>That is brilliant!</p>
<p>That is the most brilliant movie I've ever heard in my life.</p>
<p>I think audiences are going to be very uncomfortable seeing Dolph Lundgren's naked penis going into this young girl that you're talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah, just to be clear, though, I don't care either way.</p>
<p>Well, it was worth it, you know, 'cause we got the chick thing out of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So this is good.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, well, maybe we should type this stuff up and then Frank will be in touch.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Okay, we'll type it up.</p>
<p>We'll type it up and think about the representation thing.</p>
<p>Definitely, dude, definitely.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>You don't have to rep him, you could just rep me.</p>
<p>All right, let me just get all this stuff.</p>
<p>We're not a writing team.</p>
<p>Okay, are we good?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're good.</p>
<p>Okay, we're good?</p>
<p>Go ahead, Charlie.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll get...</p>
<p>Frank, I write better without him, so... okay.</p>
<p>(Frank mutters)</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p><em>The Fifth Sense?</em></p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Here we go, here we go.</p>
<p>Write, write, write a couple words.</p>
<p><em>The... Fifth...</em></p>
<p>Dude, go faster.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on. I can't.</p>
<p>Go faster.</p>
<p>Ah! I got it in my head.</p>
<p>I just, I can't type it fast enough.</p>
<p>You can't type it at all.</p>
<p>If I could type more better, then I think it would come...</p>
<p>Maybe we should get somebody else who can type.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Look at her, dude.</p>
<p>Might be good to have an older lady in the mix, right?</p>
<p>Sort of a workhorse secretary?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't care for her demographic.</p>
<p>I find them judgmental.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We need someone more our... hello.</p>
<p>Check out this one over here.</p>
<p>Does he look Indian to you at all?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, dude.</p>
<p>It would be great to have an Indian in our corner, right?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, they're natural storytellers.</p>
<p>They're great with twists.</p>
<p>Psst! Psst.</p>
<p>Dude. Uh, where are you from?</p>
<p>Baltimore.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Baltimore. Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Where are your parents from?</p>
<p>Jersey.</p>
<p>Oh. All right, getting nowhere here.</p>
<p>You're so...</p>
<p>Yeah, well, ah...</p>
<p>Is anyone in your family from India?</p>
<p>Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan, now, that's...</p>
<p>Well, isn't...?</p>
<p>...a country somewhere.</p>
<p>So where is...?</p>
<p>Yeah, what's the difference between that and...?</p>
<p>Well, they're right next to each other-- both countries.</p>
<p>That's perfect.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>That's close enough, dude.</p>
<p>There's probably a lot of going back and forth.</p>
<p>Yeah, Pakistanis are probably great with twists, too, in their own kind of way, you know?</p>
<p>How'd you like to be in the movie business?</p>
<p>Ma'am, how're you doing on makeup in there?</p>
<p>We're ready.</p>
<p>Well, I'm okay, but I feel like maybe they used a little too much blood.</p>
<p>Ma'am, we need to move here.</p>
<p>Let's go. Let's go.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is they went a little overboard.</p>
<p>I mean, can you even tell that it's me?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's perfect.</p>
<p>It's perfect.</p>
<p>We just, uh, we need to pair you up with a husband for the shot.</p>
<p>A husband?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How about this guy right here?</p>
<p>That'll work.</p>
<p>That'll work.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Holy shit, Dee.</p>
<p>This is like...</p>
<p>Wow, I could barely tell that was you.</p>
<p>I mean, what did they dip you by your heels into the blood?</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>That looks so stupid.</p>
<p>Frank had them go a little more subtle with me so you could see my face-- I'd be featured.</p>
<p>This?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is it?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How the hell did you manage that?</p>
<p>You know, I'm working my ass off.</p>
<p>Corpses, let go now!</p>
<p>Go on. Go on, go on.</p>
<p>Go on. Go on, will you?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Everybody focus, get down now.</p>
<p>Very simple shot.</p>
<p>Lot to do today.</p>
<p>Lot to do.</p>
<p>I need all corpses lying down.</p>
<p>We are losing light, people.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Ma'am, I need you to turn over.</p>
<p>Okay, I need you face down, all right?</p>
<p>Face down?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, no, 'cause then you won't be able to see my face.</p>
<p>Face down or in the pile of bodies over there.</p>
<p>You pick it.</p>
<p>Face down.</p>
<p>That's what I thought.</p>
<p>All right, energy, energy.</p>
<p>But you're dead-- dead energy.</p>
<p>Dead energy, here we go.</p>
<p>I get it. I get it.</p>
<p>Okay, so he's on the edge of this cliff throwing his nose off in the ocean because he's at the happiest point of his life.</p>
<p>No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no.</p>
<p>This is the scientist's lowest point in the movie.</p>
<p>Okay, here he throws his nose off the cliff into the ocean, because he's rejecting his life as a savior of all of mankind.</p>
<p>I finally just got it.</p>
<p>Oh, bro, that is...</p>
<p>Bro, that is deep shit, man.</p>
<p>That's nice, nice...</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>It's nice.</p>
<p>Where are you landing on the full penetration?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm into it.</p>
<p>Big time-- sleeping around.</p>
<p>The Injun says yes, so that's what we're doing.</p>
<p>It's done, it's on.</p>
<p>Uh, but, but, I, I...</p>
<p>I mean, the title...</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, the title is...</p>
<p>The title sucks.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>The title sucks.</p>
<p><em>The Fifth Sense?</em></p>
<p>I mean, it's stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who came up, who came up with that?</p>
<p>Stupid, man.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>Um, so why don't you type out this whole movie real quick and we'll go sell it to Shyamalan?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I don't write.</p>
<p>I'm a big picture kind of guy.</p>
<p>You don't write?</p>
<p>No, I...</p>
<p>(cell phone ringing)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Dennis, hey.</p>
<p>We hit a wall on the pitch.</p>
<p>Uh, what pitch is that, man?</p>
<p>The pitch of the movie that you're a producer on.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, what's up with that?</p>
<p>We realized that none of us are writers.</p>
<p>So we decided to play to our strengths and make a poster.</p>
<p>What tells a person about a movie better than a picture of what the movie is?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Uh, what are my thoughts?</p>
<p>My thoughts are, "That's brilliant."</p>
<p>I think it's cool.</p>
<p>Cut!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, shit, were you guys rolling on that?</p>
<p>Yes, we were rolling on that.</p>
<p>Do not talk on your phone during the shot, okay?</p>
<p>And you, ma'am?</p>
<p>Oh, me?</p>
<p>Do not roll over during the shot.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>But, you know what, I thought about it.</p>
<p>I feel like it's better if I'm right side up.</p>
<p>Back over.</p>
<p>"Back over."</p>
<p>Face down on the hot cement.</p>
<p>Let's roll it again, people.</p>
<p>Yeah, again!</p>
<p>(dramatic music plays)</p>
<p>(rapid gunfire)</p>
<p>(bodies and artillery thudding)</p>
<p>Brains...</p>
<p>(cell phone ringing)</p>
<p>Brains...</p>
<p>Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!</p>
<p>Cut! Cut!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(ringing continues)</p>
<p>Why are you saying "brains"?</p>
<p>Oh, 'cause it's a zombie movie.</p>
<p>It's like the Shyamalan twist.</p>
<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>This is not a zombie movie.</p>
<p>It's a movie about Serbian genocide.</p>
<p>(ringing continues)</p>
<p>Really? Huh...</p>
<p>You, sir!</p>
<p>Yes, sir, your phone-- it's ringing!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I know, but listen, man.</p>
<p>If you don't let me answer it and solve my boys' problems, then the phone's going to ring.</p>
<p>You can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>Can I talk or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, I've got to agree with him on that one, buddy.</p>
<p>I mean, you're not being very clear; which is it?</p>
<p>Turn your phone off!</p>
<p>You, miss-- don't improvise!</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I've had about enough of you dicking me around all day, okay?</p>
<p>Where is M. Night?</p>
<p>I have questions for him.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Mr. Shyamalan isn't directing this unit.</p>
<p>This is a simple pickup shot.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Where the hell is M. Night?</p>
<p>He's not here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What the hell's going on here?</p>
<p>Well, he won't get off his phone, for starters.</p>
<p>Give me your phone, Dennis.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Give me your phone.</p>
<p>I heard that.</p>
<p>No, I'll tell you exactly what's going on.</p>
<p>This guy has been treating me like a dick wad all day long, and I don't appreciate it.</p>
<p>All right, I'm going to fix it, hon.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Fire both of them and I'll take their spot.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Done. You're both fired.</p>
<p>What-- hold on a second.</p>
<p>What are you talking about, Frank?</p>
<p>Being an agent is crap.</p>
<p>I want to be an extra, lay around doing dick.</p>
<p>Great. Both of you, get your shit out of the tent.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Hey, give me my phone back, Frank.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, pal, I don't care about any of this.</p>
<p>I got my own thing going on, so...</p>
<p>(Dee whimpers)</p>
<p>I just gave you the old Shyamalan twist.</p>
<p>Ah, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>I don't care, either.</p>
<p>All right, what do I do?</p>
<p>Hey-oh!</p>
<p>Hey! Where is he, dude?</p>
<p>Where's Night?</p>
<p>We got it! We got it!</p>
<p>Dude! Dude, we totally got it.</p>
<p>Brace yourself! Brace yourself!</p>
<p><em>Crime Stinks: The Smell of Penetration.</em></p>
<p>He "Nose" the Truth.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>You get it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I, I get it.</p>
<p>Now, there is a lot going on there with Dolph.</p>
<p>We had to make some artistic compromises; I think we're good with the body.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's a lovable character, it's a lovable guy.</p>
<p>You know, these are good compromises.</p>
<p>Bottom line-- M. Night's going to love it, so where is he?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Night, uh, well...</p>
<p>Oh, he's not here.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Dee, what happened to you?</p>
<p>He brought in a B-team or something like that, covered me all in blood.</p>
<p><em>ThatSlumdogbastard twisted all</em> of us!</p>
<p>Oh, shit, dude, we need him to execute our script.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, you guys don't need Shyamalan to execute your script.</p>
<p>Because I've got the mother of all Shyamalan twists in my hand right here.</p>
<p>You see, you think I've just been playing with my phone the whole time, but you're wrong.</p>
<p>I've been writing a little movie script of my own.</p>
<p>And I finished it right before you guys called.</p>
<p>It's a horror movie about two men trapped in a garage stairwell, who get hunted down by a psychotic homeless killer... who turns out to be a security guard instead.</p>
<p>That's our story, dude.</p>
<p>Damn right it's your story, and that's why you two guys are going to be attached as producers.</p>
<p>Nice, baby!</p>
<p>Producers! All right!</p>
<p>I feel like-- I'm a natural-born producer.</p>
<p>I love showbiz, dude.</p>
<p>Guys, can I be in it?</p>
<p>Uh, you know, normally, Dee, I would take this opportunity to insult you, but I'm going to throw an insane twist your way.</p>
<p>You're going to be the lead of the film.</p>
<p>I am, really?!</p>
<p>No, you're not.</p>
<p>Twisted again.</p>
<p>Boom! Try and keep up.</p>
<p>Lot of twists.</p>
<p>Lot of twists in this thing, so try and keep up.</p>
<p>There's so many twists, I can't even follow it.</p>
<p>It's tough to follow.</p>
<p>All right, I'm going to pull up the first scene right now so you guys can get a little taste of what else is going on in this film; it's really good.</p>
<p>Yeah, lay us on it.</p>
<p>Lay us on it.</p>
<p>For some reason, the phone is frozen and I'm having a little trouble pulling up the scene.</p>
<p>It's frozen.</p>
<p>And why is there grease all over...?</p>
<p>Is this Frank's g... goddamn sausage grease?!</p>
<p>Frank, you froze my phone with your sausage greasy fingers!</p>
<p>Frank, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p>(dramatic music plays)</p>
<p>Cut! Cut!</p>
<p>For the love of Christ!</p>
