<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>You're getting hung up on "can't."</p>
<p>And I'm not saying that you can't.</p>
<p>I'm saying that it is illegal.</p>
<p>No, it is not illegal!</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Says the guy who knows nothing about the law!</p>
<p>I can absolutely keep a hummingbird as a pet, bro.</p>
<p>It's no different than having a parrot, or a parakeet. It's a bird, bro.</p>
<p>You really can't, and I'm not saying I agree with it.</p>
<p>It's just that bird law in this country- it's not governed by reason.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as bird law.</p>
<p>Yes, there is!</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a hummingbird, and I'll show you.</p>
<p>You guys, I have huge news.</p>
<p>Hummingbirds are illegal tender.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get one.</p>
<p>You cannot.</p>
<p>To spite you, I'm gonna get one.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Where are we with gulls?</p>
<p>You guys!</p>
<p>You can keep a gull as a pet.</p>
<p>But you do not want to live with a seabird, 'cause the noise level alone on those things...</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a gull up close?</p>
<p>It's gonna blast your eardrums out, dude.</p>
<p>You guys, I'm serious!</p>
<p>I have huge news here!</p>
<p>The principle is that you can have any bird that- Yo!</p>
<p>I got great news, guys.</p>
<p>Frank's got news?</p>
<p>Frank's got news?</p>
<p>[Chanting] News, news, news, news!</p>
<p>News, news, news, news, news, news, news, news!</p>
<p>I just bought a house at a foreclosure auction.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>That's amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, is it? Is it "amazing"?</p>
<p>Now hang on. You're not moving out, are you?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I bought this as an investment.</p>
<p>I bought it on the cheap.</p>
<p>Ah, you might've missed the boat on that, Frank.</p>
<p>Not the best time to invest.</p>
<p>I beg to differ with you.</p>
<p>Now is the time to invest because all the prices are low.</p>
<p>As soon as the market turns around, I'm gonna make a boatload.</p>
<p>Frank's talking about flipping the house.</p>
<p>Flip the house!</p>
<p>Making some money!</p>
<p>That's exciting.</p>
<p>I'm having a baby!</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and flush it out.</p>
<p>No. That's not-</p>
<p>"Flush it out"?</p>
<p>No. I'm not pregnant. I...</p>
<p>I answered an ad for a couple who wants a surrogate.</p>
<p>See, people who can't have kids are willing to pay a shitload of money to people like myself, who can carry it for them.</p>
<p>Wait. What's going on?</p>
<p>You're carrying someone's baby somewhere?</p>
<p>H-Hold it. I am not spending money on another little bastard.</p>
<p>I did that already, twice.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>No. They're keeping the baby. It's their baby.</p>
<p>How are you guys not understanding this?</p>
<p>Uh, Dee, before you continue this babbling, does your thing involve us in any way, or are you just kind of- at us?</p>
<p>Well, no. It's just that's huge news, so I figured you guys might want to know.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. Let's just talk about the house!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the house!</p>
<p>Hold on one second. Actually, Dee being pregnant is pretty big news.</p>
<p>Now, we could take the house idea and the baby idea and merge the two things.</p>
<p>It just feels muddy though.</p>
<p>Let's just stick with one. It's cleaner, right?</p>
<p>It could be an interesting-</p>
<p>House.</p>
<p>But I'm just saying that if- House.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly how we would take the two ideas and put them together.</p>
<p>House! But I think if we came up with something...</p>
<p>[Chanting]</p>
<p>House! House! House!</p>
<p>Just the house thing?</p>
<p>House! House! House! House!</p>
<p>House, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house, house!</p>
<p>Flush, flush, flush!</p>
<p>Deandra? Thank you so much for responding to our ad in the paper.</p>
<p>You're welcome. We've had so many letdowns going through the agency.</p>
<p>Yeah. We thought we'd just try to find a surrogate by ourselves.</p>
<p>I just feel really honored to be able to provide a service for a lovely couple like yourselves.</p>
<p>Good. Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We just had a couple questions we'd like to ask you. Shoot.</p>
<p>Honey, why don't you-</p>
<p>Okay. So- Sorry.</p>
<p>But do you have any history with drug or alcohol?</p>
<p>Never. Neither.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Um, any- any family history of mental illness?</p>
<p>Uh, well, my brother's a dick, if that counts.</p>
<p>I don't- I don't think so.</p>
<p>It's just a joke though, Sean.</p>
<p>So, the next one?</p>
<p>And- And- Okay.</p>
<p>So what about your medical history?</p>
<p>Is there any health problems we should know about?</p>
<p>Kate, I'm gonna be honest with you.</p>
<p>I have never had a health problem in my entire life.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Clean as a whistle.</p>
<p>That's amazing.</p>
<p>Down here, up here, wherever.</p>
<p>This is all great news. I mean...</p>
<p>Isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes, it really is.</p>
<p>Okay, great. So let's talk turkey.</p>
<p>And by that, I mean money.</p>
<p>Oh. We just thought we'd pay the standard rate of $20,000.</p>
<p>20,000. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like the sound of that. I'm gonna throw something at you guys, so brace yourselves.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on doubling down, so to speak, and going for twins?</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If it's a matter of price, I'm willing to cut you a deal on the second one.</p>
<p>And we don't have to stop at two.</p>
<p>I've typed up a price sheet I would like the two of you to peruse.</p>
<p>If you'll look down around number four or five, that's when you really start to see some savings.</p>
<p>You guys want to go for an Octomom thing?</p>
<p>Huh? I'm game.</p>
<p>You want to have 10?</p>
<p>You want to outdo that bitch?</p>
<p>I'll have that conversation.</p>
<p>I'm kidding.</p>
<p>I don't want 10 people inside of me.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I-I just- I think we're really just gonna do the one, I think is- is what we want.</p>
<p>One baby.</p>
<p>Look for shit on the walls, 'cause that's what they do.</p>
<p>When they know they're getting thrown out of a house, they smear feces all over the walls.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They didn't do that here. This is a pretty nice house.</p>
<p>A little lived in maybe.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I found something cooking on the stove.</p>
<p>That's pretty "unresponsible."</p>
<p>Mac and cheese. I can't believe they left all this stuff in the house.</p>
<p>I mean, what's the deal?</p>
<p>Do we have to burn it?</p>
<p>Hey, get the hell out of our house!</p>
<p>Jesus. There's people here!</p>
<p>Squatters!</p>
<p>We're not squatters! This is our house!</p>
<p>What do you mean your house?</p>
<p>I bought this house! We own this house!</p>
<p>You didn't buy it from us!</p>
<p>You bought it from the bank. We didn't sell it.</p>
<p>Oh, look, bitch! We bought it from them because they foreclosed on your bitch ass!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. You got proof? Proof?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, proof?</p>
<p>A deed, paperwork.</p>
<p>Go get your proof. Proof.</p>
<p>Bring it back here. We'll look at the paperwork.</p>
<p>Is that what you want?</p>
<p>You want proof? I'll give you proof!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Frank, take it easy, bud.</p>
<p>Take it- You gotta use your head now.</p>
<p>Think about the law.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>What happens if you accidentally hit a child with an umbrella?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the law, that is child abuse.</p>
<p>What happens then?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the law, you have to give your properties to the parents of that child.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, little kid.</p>
<p>He doesn't know the law that well.</p>
<p>I don't even know what the hell he's talking about. It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>We shouldn't bash these people up.</p>
<p>No. No!</p>
<p>Of course we shouldn't bash these people up! Look- Okay.</p>
<p>Absolutely, we could cave the husband's skull in here.</p>
<p>Yes, we could take the wife down to the basement, have a frenzied free-for-all with her.</p>
<p>We could tie the kids up in their rooms so they wouldn't hear any of it.</p>
<p>Dennis, in that scenario, we'd have to kill the kids 'cause they would've seen our faces.</p>
<p>Right. We could smear the walls with their blood.</p>
<p>Guys, there are any number of twisted scenarios that could play out here.</p>
<p>But I think the easiest thing, really, is to just go get the deed.</p>
<p>Right. Why get weird?</p>
<p>Let's just keep it simple.</p>
<p>For now, we take the high road.</p>
<p>We'll take the high road.</p>
<p>Take the high road out of here.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I'm so glad we're gonna get to work with you, Deandra.</p>
<p>Oh, Kate, Sean, I tell you what.</p>
<p>You guys are getting one hell of a uterus.</p>
<p>Great. Okay. Well, listen.</p>
<p>It was really nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Wow! This house really opens up here, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Uh- From the curb, it doesn't really look like much.</p>
<p>But once you get inside, it's got a real ass on it.</p>
<p>Well, thank you. It's always felt a little empty without a family.</p>
<p>Oh, shit! Is that a pool?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. Of course, when the baby comes, we'll have a fence around it.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>How deep?</p>
<p>The pool?</p>
<p>Yeah, the pool!</p>
<p>Uh, eight feet.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>You guys jackknife off this diving board all the time or what?</p>
<p>Oh, I used to be so good at those.</p>
<p>You mind if I get in?</p>
<p>Um- Yeah, we- we have a lot of stuff to do today.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, errands are very important, but really, the most important thing right now... is for me to stay relaxed, if you don't want my tubes to get all tensed up.</p>
<p>So, you want to go grab a swimsuit for me to borrow, or should I just jump in in my birthday gear?</p>
<p>No. Don't do that. We'll- Honey, do we have a suit that she can borrow?</p>
<p>Sure. I'll go get you that suit.</p>
<p>[Sean] Okay.</p>
<p>Good girl.</p>
<p>All right, Charlie.</p>
<p>We are gonna be gentlemen. Yup.</p>
<p>We have the law on our side.</p>
<p>We just show them the deed. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And then they vacate the premises.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And that's it. No reason to be animals about it.</p>
<p>And they changed the locks.</p>
<p>Yes, they did. You were right, Frank!</p>
<p>They changed the locks, bud.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, these people, they're uncivilized deadbeats.</p>
<p>Let's smash the door down.</p>
<p>All right, ready? Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>Together</strong>: And a-one, and a-two, and a-three...</p>
<p>[Shouting]</p>
<p>[Groans] - <strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, that- that was a bummer.</p>
<p>Man. I gotta admit, that's, uh...</p>
<p>That felt very unsatisfying to me.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah, I didn't like that.</p>
<p>Should you guys, um...</p>
<p>No. Try smashing it from the inside?</p>
<p>Let's just give it another shot. And-</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Give it another one.</p>
<p>Kick it.</p>
<p>Nice, dude!</p>
<p>My door!</p>
<p>My door, deadbeat!</p>
<p>My door!</p>
<p>And what's this shyster lawyer doing here?</p>
<p>Well, it is just so nice to see you again, Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p>I see that you're still just... horrible.</p>
<p>Yes, you're horrible too.</p>
<p>And I hate your tie. Hey. All right.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>This family behind me- Yeah.</p>
<p>Has 90 days to vacate.</p>
<p>Deadbeats.</p>
<p>Until then, you can't touch them.</p>
<p>That's bull bird, man.</p>
<p>What do you got there?</p>
<p>Let me handle this, Frank. It's not bull bird.</p>
<p>I'll tell you that right now.</p>
<p>He's making a few good points.</p>
<p>Look, buddy.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>I know a lot about the law and various other lawyerings.</p>
<p>I'm well educated, well versed.</p>
<p>I know that situations like this, real-estate wise, they're very complex.</p>
<p>Actually, they're pretty simple.</p>
<p>The forms are all standard boilerplate.</p>
<p>Okay. We're all hungry.</p>
<p>We're gonna get to our hot plates soon enough.</p>
<p>All right? Well, let's talk about the contract here...</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I forgot.</p>
<p>Where did you go to law school again?</p>
<p>Uh, well, I could ask you that very same question. I went to Harvard.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. How 'bout you?</p>
<p>Where? Yeah? Hmm?</p>
<p>I'm pleading the Fifth, sir.</p>
<p>I'd advise that you do that.</p>
<p>I'll take that advice into cooperation. All right?</p>
<p>Let's say you and I go toe-to-toe on bird law and see who comes out the victor.</p>
<p>You know, I don't think I'm gonna do anything close to that, and I can see clearly you know nothing about the law.</p>
<p>It seems like you have a tenuous grasp on the English language in general.</p>
<p>Okay. Well- Filibuster.</p>
<p>Uh- Do you- Do you know what that word means?</p>
<p>Yup!</p>
<p>Yeah, what's that mean?</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>[Door Shattering]</p>
<p>I-I'm gonna- We're gonna- [Groans]</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p>Now I'm all churned up about this.</p>
<p>I can't wait 90 days to get rid of those people.</p>
<p>I mean, I gotta sell that house.</p>
<p>Frank, don't be rash.</p>
<p>It's just 90 days.</p>
<p>No. In 90 days, there's gonna be shit all over those walls.</p>
<p>[Scoffs] Those people are gonna trash that house.</p>
<p>We won't be able to get a dime for it.</p>
<p>I am calling a Realtor right now.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, Frank. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>[Phone Beeps]</p>
<p>Maybe we could sell the house ourselves, you know?</p>
<p>Save the five percent.</p>
<p>What do Realtors do anyway?</p>
<p>They pop on a blazer.</p>
<p>They walk people through a house.</p>
<p>We can do that.</p>
<p>Mac, the real estate business is something that takes a lot of style and a lot of finesse, and that's something that the two of us both have in spades.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I'm thinking we do like a classic good Realtor-bad Realtor dynamic.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. I'm the good, you're the bad?</p>
<p>You're the sweet to my sour.</p>
<p>The honey to your vinegar?</p>
<p>That's good, dude!</p>
<p>Honey and Vinegar Realty.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I like the Honey and Vinegar.</p>
<p>I like what I'm hearing, boys.</p>
<p>Okay! I knew that guy was full of shit! I knew it!</p>
<p>What guy?</p>
<p>That lawyer guy. Okay?</p>
<p>He totally besmirched me today, and I demand satisfaction from him.</p>
<p>You want him to bang you?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>No, Mac. Be serious, okay?</p>
<p>He slandered me in front of a jury of my own peers. All right?</p>
<p>Look what they used to do when that sort of thing happened.</p>
<p>Take a look at this picture.</p>
<p>What do you see?</p>
<p>I see two trannies shooting at each other.</p>
<p>No, dude.</p>
<p>They're dueling, okay?</p>
<p>These are lawyers settling an argument by dueling it out.</p>
<p>Now, how do you know that the two trannies are lawyers?</p>
<p>'Cause it's an old book, okay?</p>
<p>I don't have to explain everything to you about what I know!</p>
<p>I'm trying to get satisfied from this dude, and you're trying to...</p>
<p>I'm getting satisfied.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Deandra?</p>
<p>Collecting the money you bitches owe me.</p>
<p>I'm going on maternity leave.</p>
<p>What are you jabbering about now?</p>
<p>I got a sweet setup going on as a surrogate for a couple of rich yuppies.</p>
<p>They have a huge house, kick-ass pool.</p>
<p>I'm living the high life.</p>
<p>So suck on that, white stains.</p>
<p>Oh, dude!</p>
<p>I knew we should've done the baby thing.</p>
<p>Now there's a pool involved?</p>
<p>When was the last time you swam in a pool?</p>
<p>I want to swim in the pool!</p>
<p>It's been like forever since I swam in a pool.</p>
<p>No, no! Now, let's focus here.</p>
<p>We gotta sell this house.</p>
<p>And then we can go swim in Deandra's pool.</p>
<p>Hey, Vic.</p>
<p>You got that other snack tray?</p>
<p>I certainly do, Hugh.</p>
<p>Certainly do. Okay, great.</p>
<p>People are gonna be here any second.</p>
<p>I want them to be well fed.</p>
<p>The house looks nice. The house looks nice.</p>
<p>It does look nice.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>You jerks aren't supposed to be here when my mom and dad are at work!</p>
<p>Your mom and dad aren't at work.</p>
<p>That's why they lost the house.</p>
<p>They're probably at the dog track getting wasted.</p>
<p>Dude, eat my boogers.</p>
<p>You eat my boogers! Whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Hey, Vic, Vic. Whoa.</p>
<p>Smell that vinegar boiling up inside you.</p>
<p>But I need you to save some of it for the customer.</p>
<p>Do that for me, okay, baby boy?</p>
<p>What the hell's going on out here?</p>
<p>Frank, can you get these kids out of here?</p>
<p>Yeah. Come on.</p>
<p>We're gonna go paint your room a color that's not stupid.</p>
<p>Then we're gonna throw your toys in the trash!</p>
<p>Listen, I need you on my team.</p>
<p>You on my team?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm- I'm on your team.</p>
<p>All right, great. Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah. I just- He gets me-</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>[Knocking]</p>
<p>Oh! Here we go.</p>
<p>Hi! How are ya? - How you doing?</p>
<p>We're here to look at the house.</p>
<p>Of course. Yeah, come on in. Hi.</p>
<p>I'm Hugh Honey. How you doing?</p>
<p>Good. This is my associate, Vic Vinegar. Hi. Tad.</p>
<p>And we are here to show you this house.</p>
<p>Okay. Oh!</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Okay. [Chuckles] Come on in.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good. All right. This is the living room.</p>
<p>Okay! Wonderful.</p>
<p>Now, what do you folks think?</p>
<p>It's a beautiful house, right?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I'm thinking this might be a bit large for what we need.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.</p>
<p>Is this house too big for you? - Now, Vic.</p>
<p>Just a second, Hugh. Why don't you ask your wife what she needs, pal?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. Is she used to something smaller, and you don't think she can handle it?</p>
<p>Okay, I think we're gonna get going.</p>
<p>It's okay, you guys. I'm here.</p>
<p>I want this to be a good experience for you.</p>
<p>Okay? I'll tell you what, buddy.</p>
<p>How 'bout I take your wife upstairs and show her what it's like... to be deep inside a really big house?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Uh, you'll have to excuse my associate.</p>
<p>It's just his passion for quality real estate that makes him so intense.</p>
<p>Now, what can we do to put you in this house?</p>
<p>I think we're just gonna go now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you gonna buy the house?</p>
<p>[Woman] We're gonna go.</p>
<p>Are you going to buy this house?</p>
<p>We don't want any trouble.</p>
<p>Are you going to buy this house?</p>
<p>I don't know! I don't know!</p>
<p>Are you going to buy this house?</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>"Yes" what?</p>
<p>Yes, I will buy this house!</p>
<p>That's it. There we go. That's all I wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Congratulations, folks.</p>
<p>You just bought a brand-new house.</p>
<p>Can we go?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Go, honey. Go.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>I'm going!</p>
<p>Just go!</p>
<p>All right. We'll be in touch.</p>
<p>Oh! That was amazing, bro!</p>
<p>You think that's gonna work?</p>
<p>Bro, it already did work. You heard the skirt.</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, I will buy this house."</p>
<p>That is a binding verbal contract.</p>
<p>Now, I heard it. You heard it.</p>
<p>And that pussy husband of hers heard it too.</p>
<p>If they back out now, I will find them, I will strangle them, I will beat them into oblivion!</p>
<p>Wow! Wow!</p>
<p>I'm full of the vinegar.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey. How'd it go?</p>
<p>Sold it!</p>
<p>Sold the house.</p>
<p>Sold it? Fantastic!</p>
<p>Let's get another house, flip it over, make some cash.</p>
<p>It's not really the cash that I care about anymore.</p>
<p>It's the thrill of the sale that I'm responding to.</p>
<p>You're driven by the thrill of the sale.</p>
<p>You know what I'm thinking?</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to merge the two ideas after all.</p>
<p>Baby in the house?</p>
<p>Baby in the house.</p>
<p>[Chuckling] Honey and Vinegar?</p>
<p>Okay. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>All right. I'll get on it.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Well, well, well, well, well!</p>
<p>If it isn't the big-time, hotshot lawyer man.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I do not have time for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we both have busy schedules, so I'll make this quick.</p>
<p>I shan't mince words with you for long.</p>
<p>I am challenging you, sir, to a duel.</p>
<p>I accept.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>[Pen Tapping On Desk]</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah. I accept your challenge.</p>
<p>Do you want time to think it over?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No. No, not at all.</p>
<p>Um, what time were you thinking of dueling?</p>
<p>[Exhales] Any time is good, really.</p>
<p>I don't have...</p>
<p>You don't have time 'cause you would have to go out and get a proper gun.</p>
<p>Oh. No, no, no.</p>
<p>I have a gun. I actually keep one right here in the drawer.</p>
<p>You got one right there?</p>
<p>I don't need to see it.</p>
<p>I like to keep it loaded because you never know who's gonna walk into a law office these days.</p>
<p>[Laughing] Safety first.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So let's rethink some things.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat]</p>
<p>Let's say that you've learned your lesson now, and I've learned a little lesson.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>And we'll call it even, and I will respectfully decline the duel.</p>
<p>Well, you can't decline.</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>As you know, once the duel's been accepted, you know, there's no backing out.</p>
<p>I mean, that's the law.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Anyway, great! This is settled.</p>
<p>And I was looking for something to do tomorrow afternoon anyway.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna pencil you in for high noon tomorrow. Don't do it.</p>
<p>Don't do it.</p>
<p>And, uh, don't worry...</p>
<p>'cause, um, wherever you are, I'll find you.</p>
<p>Yeah. - I'm gonna put one right between your teeth.</p>
<p>And it's just gonna pop out the back of your neck. [Clicks Tongue]</p>
<p>Hey, Deandra?</p>
<p>Can we talk to you for a sec?</p>
<p>Hey, you guys.</p>
<p>Watch me bust out this sweet jackknife.</p>
<p>Oh! Whoa!</p>
<p>[Gasps, Coughing]</p>
<p>[Laughing] You guys!</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, I biffed that one, huh?</p>
<p>You "biffed" it?</p>
<p>Whoo! Thank God there wasn't a baby in there, huh?</p>
<p>Could you get me a refill on that, guy?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Piña colada. Been crushing them.</p>
<p>They're great in the heat.</p>
<p>Ah. I don't think you should be drinking and swimming.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Dingdong! Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We're looking for Deandra Reynolds.</p>
<p>Oh, there she is.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. Don't do that. We're the wealthy homosexual couple she promised her womb to.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are. I'm Hugh Honey, and this is my partner, Vic Vinegar.</p>
<p>We're partners in real estate, and we're partners in life.</p>
<p>[Dee Laughing] Oh, hi!</p>
<p>Oh, hey!</p>
<p>Oh, you guys!</p>
<p>How are you doing, sweetie?</p>
<p>Oh, excuse us for just one second.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>It's good to see you.</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>Do not ruin this for me!</p>
<p>Dee, relax. Okay? We're gonna start a bidding war, drive up the price of your womb.</p>
<p>Why would I want you to drive up the price of my womb?</p>
<p>If we make this couple desperate enough for money, they'll sell their house to us.</p>
<p>We're buying every house in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yeah, check it out.</p>
<p>We get the house, you get a higher price for that kid you're crapping out. Everybody wins.</p>
<p>We're merging the ideas. I didn't want to merge the ideas in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, we're merging 'em, so get used to it.</p>
<p>Uh, we're giving Deandra $100,000 to carry a child for us.</p>
<p>Now, I'll be providing the sperm, of course.</p>
<p>And I'll be providing the money because I'm the breadwinner in the relationship.</p>
<p>And I'm the trophy husband.</p>
<p>He's my bottom.</p>
<p>Oh! I'm the power bottom.</p>
<p>Technically, I generate most of the power.</p>
<p>Only because I'm giving out so much power from the top.</p>
<p>You need to generate power to accept it.</p>
<p>Deandra, what the hell are they talking about? - I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>[Sean] Who's this guy?</p>
<p>Oh, splinter!</p>
<p>There's a gate, bro!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Pardon me, ma'am, sir.</p>
<p>Everything's fine 'cause Daddy's here now.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>I'm the father of the baby growing inside of her stomach, and I need a safe place to hide.</p>
<p>What baby are you talking about, Charlie?</p>
<p>I'm not pregnant yet!</p>
<p>[Crashing]</p>
<p>Abort!</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>Abort! Abort!</p>
<p>Do not buy this house!</p>
<p>There's a goddamn gate!</p>
<p>I just got done with that lawyer.</p>
<p>He threatened to sue me.</p>
<p>What? Why? - Well, I had those kids painting their room.</p>
<p>And then I told them to go down, rip some copper pipes out.</p>
<p>Their little hands got all bloody.</p>
<p>Big deal.</p>
<p>And they- I had to give them the house to settle the suit.</p>
<p>Okay, that's it. You all are crazy, and I'm asking you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>So, let's go.</p>
<p>Please leave.</p>
<p>Oh, are you sure? Really?</p>
<p>This is a very inviting pool.</p>
<p>You heard the guy! You heard him!</p>
<p>Oh, you two.</p>
<p>I am so sorry about that.</p>
<p>Boy, that was nuts, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, we're gonna have to ask you to leave as well.</p>
<p>But what about the baby?</p>
<p>We're just gonna find someone else.</p>
<p>Oh, you guys!</p>
<p>You got me there! I thought you were serious.</p>
<p>We are serious, Deandra.</p>
<p>[Splashing]</p>
<p>Oh, this shit is like a bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Jackknife!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! Cannonball!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Come on in, Dee.</p>
<p>Chicken fight! Chicken fight!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Let's do a chicken fight!</p>
<p>Chicken fight! Chicken fight!</p>
<p>Chicken fight! Chicken fight!</p>
<p>Chicken fight!</p>
<p>[Shouting]</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
