<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hey, hey! What do you think of these, guys?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: My God, Frank. My God.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You look ridiculous in those, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dude, why are you wearing skinny jeans?</p>
<p>Because they're hip. And I want to stay young.</p>
<p>Well, stay old, bro. Because that looks terrible. Dress your age.</p>
<p>I like 'em. I think they make me look sexy. [Laughs]</p>
<p>I am getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment watching you parade around in those things.</p>
<p>So I say keep them.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's like a Humpty Dumpty vibe going on with those. I don't know if you want...</p>
<p>Yo-oh! Big news, bitches! The ban's been lifted.</p>
<p>And we are back in. Flipadelphia, here we come!</p>
<p>Ohh! Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!</p>
<p>Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!</p>
<p>Flip! Flip!</p>
<p>Flip- Yeah! Adelphia!</p>
<p>What the hell is Flipadelphia? What is Flipadelphia?</p>
<p>Dude, it's a city-wide flip cup tournament. It's the best.</p>
<p>Yeah. We were the bar to beat 10 years ago until we got muscled out.</p>
<p>Yeah. They very, very unfairly accused us of poisoning our rival team.</p>
<p>Yes. You got framed?</p>
<p>No, we did poison the shit out of them. But they didn't have any proof.</p>
<p>So you have a rival?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, big-time.</p>
<p>This dive bar down the street called Molly's. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. This year we're gonna jam it right up their butt holes.</p>
<p>Ohh! Wow. Yeah, me, Dennis and Charlie will jam their butt holes.</p>
<p>You're not gonna come anywhere near their butt holes. Let us handle the butt holes.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You guys, I- I'm your number four.</p>
<p>I'm your "Adelphia." And you can't- Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>But, Dee, I mean, what, do you, like, not remember the past?</p>
<p>You choked under pressure in '98. You blew the whole thing.</p>
<p>We were gonna win. And then you couldn't flip your damn cup over.</p>
<p>I know, Charlie! That's why I've been practicing ever since.</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta give me a chance to redeem myself.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. You will have a chance to redeem yourself.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what do you say we throw a little gas on the rivalry fire?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I thought you said this place was a shithole.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was. But looks like they've made a few renovations.</p>
<p>All right, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>Could be a scheme.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys ready?</p>
<p>Probably, yeah.</p>
<p>Guess who, bitches!</p>
<p>[Shouting]</p>
<p>Are you guys hungry, huh?</p>
<p>Enjoying your meals?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! Whoo!</p>
<p>Oh, everybody have some lemon on it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Honk, honk, honk.</p>
<p>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</p>
<p>Will they highest ranking member of the staff please step forward?</p>
<p>I'm, uh, Art Sloan. I'm the owner. Huh?</p>
<p>[Laughing] Uh, you're Art Sloan?</p>
<p>Now see, you look very different from what I remember.</p>
<p>Do I know you people?</p>
<p>Uh, allow me to refresh your memory. Ohh!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. What- What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Flip cup. Ten years ago? We poisoned you, dude. Remember?</p>
<p>Oh, wait a minute, yeah. We got really sick. Yeah.</p>
<p>You acted sick. But check it out.</p>
<p>Who's to say we didn't put that very same poison in the drinking water?</p>
<p>[All Groaning]</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, relax.</p>
<p>He's lying. He doesn't have any poison.</p>
<p>No, I don't have any on me. But I do keep some in my fridge at home in the relish jar.</p>
<p>There's poison in that jar? I thought I was allergic to pickles.</p>
<p>What's in the jar with the skull and crossbones?</p>
<p>Oh, that's mayonnaise. That's a decoy.</p>
<p>And the mayo?</p>
<p>That's shampoo.</p>
<p>You're telling me I've been putting shampoo on my sandwiches?</p>
<p>If you're using the mayonnaise, yeah, probably. I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Is there something that I can do for you people?</p>
<p>Yeah! We came to tell you we're reigniting the rivalry, dick worm.</p>
<p>It's back on, bitch!</p>
<p>You know what? I-I am not your rival, okay?</p>
<p>I never was. And I am certainly not participating in Flipadelphia.</p>
<p>Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!</p>
<p>Flip, flip- Oh!</p>
<p>Looks like someone's scared, guys.</p>
<p>Now you're just being childish.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, yeah? How's this for childish, bro? [Urinating]</p>
<p>All right, that's it! I'm calling the cops.</p>
<p>He pissed on your bar! Yeah, call the cops!</p>
<p>See you Saturday. Don't be late.</p>
<p>Three, two, one, go!</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p>No, you're doing it too high! Get it! Get it!</p>
<p>What are you doing? What are you doing?</p>
<p>I don't know, you guys. I was...</p>
<p>That was terrible! I'm sorry, okay?</p>
<p>I thought you had been practicing.</p>
<p>I have been practicing! I don't know what happened!</p>
<p>You know, it's her bison-sized fingers!</p>
<p>I don't have bison fingers! I don't have bison fingers.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, you do.</p>
<p>Your mother had to have a C-section because of those hands.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys are just all screaming in my face!</p>
<p>People are going to scream at the tournament!</p>
<p>That's it. She's off the team.</p>
<p>Shut up, Frank!</p>
<p>You're not even on the team!</p>
<p>That's true. What is my role here?</p>
<p>Why did you bring that up?</p>
<p>Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>You're not gonna be on the flip cup team.</p>
<p>No. Definitely not.</p>
<p>Maybe you could be, um, team instigator.</p>
<p>Yeah! There we go.</p>
<p>That works. I'll be the instigator.</p>
<p>Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll instigate. In the meantime, we need to find a replacement for Dee.</p>
<p>We need a replacement. No! No, no, no, no, no!</p>
<p>That's not fair, you guys.</p>
<p>Don't replace me!</p>
<p>You're being replaced.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll tell you what, Dee. If you can prove to us... that you can flip 10 cups in a row under pressure, you're back on the team.</p>
<p>Yes! Okay, I gotta practice. That's all I need. All right.</p>
<p>I gotta warm up. You see, I went into this cold. I came in here cold.</p>
<p>That's what my problem was.</p>
<p>One mistake and you're off the team.</p>
<p>That oughta keep her busy for at least a week or so.</p>
<p>I don't think she'll ever get that.</p>
<p>Okay, in the meantime, let's find a replacement. Yes.</p>
<p>And I know just the place to go.</p>
<p>Where? Same place I learned to hone my God-given flip cup skills.</p>
<p>The Delta Omega Lambda fraternity house at Penn. Wait.</p>
<p>That was, like, 15 years ago. I don't think you'd have any clout there.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, man. I was the king of that place. I'm a legend over there.</p>
<p>Oh. This brings me back.</p>
<p>Got the alumni's up here. Nice.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Oh, man.</p>
<p>This is the class.</p>
<p>Oh, man. There's Ritter.</p>
<p>Oh, that's- "I chug dick"? No.</p>
<p>What? I never- I don't chug dick. That's crazy.</p>
<p>Why would you even put-</p>
<p>That's not funny.</p>
<p>Come on, that's homophobic.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. What the hell?</p>
<p>bitch!</p>
<p>Pick it back up!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: No, shake the ass! Shake the ass!</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go!</p>
<p>Like this!</p>
<p>Frank? What the hell are you doing, man?</p>
<p>I'm recruiting these guys for the flip cup thing.</p>
<p>I almost got this, Dennis.</p>
<p>Whoo-whoo-whoo!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>That's real funny shit, Frank!</p>
<p>Step out for a second and let me handle this.</p>
<p>All right, guys- [Laughs]</p>
<p>I'm Brother Reynolds, class of '98.</p>
<p>Dude, we were cruising in sixth grade in '98, man.</p>
<p>Oh, sixth grade? Cool, man.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I kind of blazed the trail... for these sorts of shenanigans you guys got going on in here.</p>
<p>What's going on with this kid?</p>
<p>Oh, he's a pledge.</p>
<p>And we're zapping his nuts with a stun gun every couple of hours.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Look at him, man!</p>
<p>That's brutal, man. Wow.</p>
<p>Let me- Let me get in on that.</p>
<p>You- You want to get in on this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sort of a legend when it comes to this kind of shit. So, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Cool.</p>
<p>Here, man.</p>
<p>[All Laughing]</p>
<p>Down he goes!</p>
<p>Oh, shit! That really hurts!</p>
<p>Dennis, these guys are badass shitheads!</p>
<p>Oh, man! You got any ludes?</p>
<p>Ludes? I don't think they make those anymore, man. No?</p>
<p>We got Ritarall.</p>
<p>Ritarall?</p>
<p>Yeah. What's Ritarall?</p>
<p>Oh, snortski. Ohh. Mmm.</p>
<p>[Inhales]</p>
<p>Ooh! Ooh, that's tasty stuff.</p>
<p>Uh, God.</p>
<p>Zap him again.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>[Screams]</p>
<p>It's that- It's that easy.</p>
<p>Don't do that shit again, you little idiot!</p>
<p>Okay? Have some respect for a brother, okay? I'm a legend around this place.</p>
<p>So don't zap me again! All right, listen. I came here for a reason, okay?</p>
<p>I came here to recruit you for a flip cup tournament.</p>
<p>Flip cup? Flip cup? What are you, a freshman? That is so lame.</p>
<p>Take a look at how loose his jeans are.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p>Let me have it a minute.</p>
<p>[Screaming] No more zapping.</p>
<p>All right, all right. No more zapping.</p>
<p>We're done.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Stop, stop, stop!</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: All right, focus. You can do this.</p>
<p>One more time, just- Oh, Dee. Dee, it's getting hard to watch.</p>
<p>Really. I can't stop grinding my teeth.</p>
<p>I don't know how these kids study on this goddamn Ritarall.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know either! And I don't give a shit!</p>
<p>Hey. So how did the recruiting go?</p>
<p>Oh, it was bad.</p>
<p>We both got punked. Yeah, we both got punked, Frank. We both got punked!</p>
<p>That's right. These kids these days, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>They're nothing like we used to be back when we were in fraternities.</p>
<p>They have no respect for anybody, okay?</p>
<p>They're like stupid little goddamn savages.</p>
<p>They're bitches! They're bitches! They're little bitches.</p>
<p>I came in there, right? And I was polite, and I was nice to them.</p>
<p>I was cordial. And they completely goddamn disrespected me!</p>
<p>Little idiots! Idiots!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was completely respectful. They're supposed to be my brothers, right?</p>
<p>They're my brothers?</p>
<p>No, no. That's not fun.</p>
<p>What they were doing wasn't fun. They kept zapping us and zapping us.</p>
<p>Idiots! Savages! Idiots!</p>
<p>No, zap, zap, zap, zap.</p>
<p>Idiots! Jesus Christ, dude. Calm down.</p>
<p>Man, that's- All right, I'm just...</p>
<p>They disrespect- I am a legend over there!</p>
<p>I know you're a legend.</p>
<p>Charlie knows you're a legend, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's just the viciousness of youth.</p>
<p>That wasn't fun!</p>
<p>It's not fun! It's not fun!</p>
<p>Savages!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, dude. Maybe you should step down from the fraternity thing.</p>
<p>Look, we haven't gotten Art Sloan to sign up yet.</p>
<p>He has not signed up.</p>
<p>Why don't you focus some of that weird rage on him?</p>
<p>Charlie and I'll handle the frat kids from here, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I'll totally pull a Good Will Hunting on those kids... and that'll put 'em in their place.</p>
<p>How are you gonna do that?</p>
<p>Well, you've seen the movie, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So all I gotta do is I'll ask them some like big shot, like, math or science, history-type college question... and then I'll totally stump them by knowing a lot more about the answer than they do.</p>
<p>Yeah, in that movie, Matt Damon played a genius janitor. You're just a janitor.</p>
<p>Right. [Chuckles]</p>
<p>You stumped me with that one. That's a good point.</p>
<p>You didn't have a comeback for that.</p>
<p>How are you gonna have a comeback in the frat house?</p>
<p>Then you ask them the math or history-type question...</p>
<p>Ah, but you're not a janitor. Don't do that.</p>
<p>Just, please, please take care of those little savages. Got it.</p>
<p>Don't do that. Don't do that.</p>
<p>It'll work if you just say some lines from the movie.</p>
<p>It works. Flip. That's too big. That's too big.</p>
<p>[Chattering]</p>
<p>♪♪ [Techno]</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, my.</p>
<p>What is going on in here, dude?</p>
<p>Oh, my.</p>
<p>Woo-hoo-hoo!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It's like some kind of paint party.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>They're painting each other up!</p>
<p>Is this what college is like, man?</p>
<p>I don't know, man. I wish I went to college.</p>
<p>I feel like I got boned big-time, dude!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ. Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, yo!</p>
<p>You're painting him?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my God. They're painting each other.</p>
<p>No! No, no, no! Charlie! Stay focused, dude. Right!</p>
<p>Stay focused. We gotta find guys for the team. Right, right, right!</p>
<p>Nothing will distract us. Nothing!</p>
<p>Okay. Do not get distracted.</p>
<p><strong>Together</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Together</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p>Do you want to paint us up?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Uh, paint you up? How?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, first we paint you, and then you paint us.</p>
<p>Well, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh- Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>How do we do the painting?</p>
<p>[Laughs] With our hands.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>[Laughing] Awesome.</p>
<p>Sorry. Excuse us.</p>
<p>Uh, are you ready?</p>
<p>Yeah. No, we're ready. We're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Artie Sloan.</p>
<p>Tying his shirts in knots!</p>
<p>I like to humiliate guys, sure. I'm no different than those guys are now, man.</p>
<p>Yeah! You know? Like, I used to be the same way.</p>
<p>I used to dress guys up like bananas and walk them around the quad.</p>
<p>Or I'd take a banana and stick it up some guy's ass in front of his best friend.</p>
<p>And I'd be like, "Hey! Banana ass! How you doing?"</p>
<p>Or maybe I'd, like, uh- I'd like take the tip of my penis... and stick it in a guy's mouth for, like, just a second, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like while he was sleeping. [Laughing] I'm all about that shit!</p>
<p>You know what I mean? But you don't stun gun a guy who was a goddamn legend!</p>
<p>No! And those guys, they need to recognize that shit!</p>
<p>I was a- I was a trailblazer!</p>
<p>But these kids these days in fraternities, it's like they don't have any respect.</p>
<p>They don't care about anybody but themselves, you know?</p>
<p>And I don't understand that. It's like they live in a fantasy world, where, "Oh, no. There's no consequences for my actions. I can do whatever the hell I want! And treat people however the hell I want to treat 'em!" [Flushes]</p>
<p>And I don't get that.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Frank? What is that?</p>
<p>Well, what I'm doing is I'm cutting the shower curtain in half waist high... so that when he's in using it, people can see his junk.</p>
<p>Wow, Frank. That Ritarall's having a very interesting affect on what you think.</p>
<p>I love this feeling! Yeah!</p>
<p>Got any more of it?</p>
<p>Does a bear shit in the woods?</p>
<p>Well, cut up a couple of rails, buddy! I'm gonna blast off!</p>
<p>All right. Here you go. All right.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Let's do this!</p>
<p>And we're done!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie and Mac</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>That was awesome. Oh, that's so awesome.</p>
<p>That's so awesome. And now you do us.</p>
<p>Oh, man! Yeah.</p>
<p>And then for the best part.</p>
<p>There's a better part than this? There can't be a better part.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>When we shower together and wash each other off.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do. Whoo!</p>
<p>[Chuckles]</p>
<p>That's exactly what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>What do you two clowns think you're doing?</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>Nah, it's cool, man. We're good. We're good.</p>
<p>No! You assholes gotta go!</p>
<p>No, man. Come on.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. Yeah, you do. You do, man. You do.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I'm telling you no, dude. I'm telling you no. Guys. Guys. Guys.</p>
<p>We're trying to have a conversation, please.</p>
<p>No! You're not in the frat.</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>Guys, you're killing me.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull a Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>No, no, Charlie.</p>
<p>What's your major, dude?</p>
<p>Economics.</p>
<p>Oh! Bet you're reading a lot of Gordon Wood, huh!</p>
<p>You read your Gordon Wood and you regurgitate it from a textbook... and you think you're wicked awesome doing that!</p>
<p>And how about them apples? And all that Gordon Wood business!</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>You are an idiot.</p>
<p>You are an idiot.</p>
<p>Does no one know who Gordon Wood is?</p>
<p>You know what, Cheesefoot? Go get the stun gun.</p>
<p>That's a great idea. That's a great idea.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>[Both Sighing]</p>
<p>[Crickets Chirping]</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank! Dude!</p>
<p>I'm finished!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>I'm finished. What are you doing? What do you got going on?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm doing this jerk-off's taxes!</p>
<p>Next year the I.R.S. Will audit the piss out of him!</p>
<p>Oh! That's so weird! That's so- That's long-term shit. I would- Yes!</p>
<p>I like that! I like that!</p>
<p>Yes. Good.</p>
<p>Do me a favor, man. Can you go upstairs and look down onto the lawn?</p>
<p>I've done it. I've done it. I've done something.</p>
<p>You've done it? Yeah.</p>
<p>Give me the cigar. I need that.</p>
<p>What'd you do?</p>
<p>I have done "it."</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>[Exhales]</p>
<p>I've created a masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>I think our work here is done.</p>
<p>It's so unfair, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, dude.</p>
<p>So unfair!</p>
<p>I mean, like, if I had known college was anything like that, the amount of book learning I would have put to my brain- Read! And math, dude!</p>
<p>To get there and stay there.</p>
<p>They shower together!</p>
<p>And naked.</p>
<p>Oh! Boom! The rivalry's back on, boys! It is back on!</p>
<p>The rivalry's back on?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! It's back on!</p>
<p>All right! Rivalry! Rivalry.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry. Rivalry.</p>
<p>[Sighs] Goddamn it. This feels forced. I... I'm not into it.</p>
<p>I'm definitely forcing it.</p>
<p>Why is that? Something's off! Something's off, dude!</p>
<p>You know what it is for me?</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself. But it's those goddamn punk-ass frat kids, man. They got to me, dude. They really got to me! They burned me and I haven't let it go.</p>
<p>Dude! They burned us too, man!</p>
<p>Did they burn you guys?</p>
<p>Is that why you're painted like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, what's going on?</p>
<p>They have like this magical thing going on.</p>
<p>Things are different now.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys. Watch this.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Ohh! Ohh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>[Cheering]</p>
<p>Ten in a row! Nice!</p>
<p>With everybody watching!</p>
<p>This guy! This guy!</p>
<p>Holy shit! That was amazing, Dee!</p>
<p>And you just gave me a thought, okay?</p>
<p>I think we need to rethink who our rivals are.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, bro, the Art Sloan-Molly's rivalry, that's, like, 10 years old!</p>
<p>That's old shit, man! I think our new rivals are those punk-ass frat kids!</p>
<p>Dude, those guys are dicks.</p>
<p>They're such dicks, man!</p>
<p>And I think with Dee's newfound flip cup skills, we can embarrass the shit out of those little bitches!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. I will take any excuse to get back to that party.</p>
<p>Okay! That's it! It's a rivalry!</p>
<p>The new rivalry!</p>
<p>♪♪ [Techno]</p>
<p>What do you guys want?</p>
<p>We want one game of flip cup.</p>
<p>If you guys win, you get to drink at our bar forever, for free.</p>
<p>If we win, we get to come to your frat whenever we want.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And paint girls!</p>
<p>And get painted by them!</p>
<p>And take showers with them!</p>
<p>Lots of showers.</p>
<p>Okay. You're on.</p>
<p>All right. These guys are gonna be really fast.</p>
<p>So we need to get on to a quick lead.</p>
<p>Dee, I want you to start us off.</p>
<p>Really? Yes. Charlie, you're gonna take us home as the anchor.</p>
<p>Naturally.</p>
<p>All right.</p>

<p>You guys, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You guys, one more time.</p>

<p>I feel like we could really get these guys!</p>
<p>Don't you see, Dee?</p>
<p>We've already won.</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>What does that mean? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Ohh! Oh, God.</p>
<p>[Stomach Gurgling]</p>
<p>Hey, what- Whoa. What's going on with me?</p>
<p>Oh, what's going on is that you just drank a cup of poison!</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p>Paddy's Pub, bitches!</p>
<p>[Stomachs Gurgling]</p>
<p>You guys poisoned the beer?</p>
<p>Yes, Dee, we did poison the beer.</p>
<p>That was the only way we could beat these little bitches!</p>
<p>I thought you guys believed in me. You were so proud of me.</p>
<p>Oh, no. We knew you were gonna choke.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. We knew you'd pretty much choke under pressure.</p>
<p>Which is why- We poisoned your ass!</p>
<p>Flip, flip, Flipadelphia!</p>

<p>Rip 'em off! Pull 'em of! Yank em! Yank 'em!</p>
<p>They're not coming off!</p>
<p>Yank 'em! Yank 'em!</p>
<p>We're gonna have to burn 'em off, I think. No!</p>
<p>Gotta get 'em off 'cause I got no circulation in my legs.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>You've got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>Whoa-ho. Hey, hey, pump your brakes there, pal. Slow down for a second.</p>
<p>What- What's your problem exactly?</p>
<p>What- What's my problem?</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? You disrespected my business. You vandalized my home. All in the name of some stupid drinking competition. And then when I finally cave in, you don't even show up.</p>
<p>Show up for what?</p>
<p>Well... Flipadelphia!</p>
<p>Oh, Flipadelphia! Oh, sh... Was that today?</p>
<p>Yeah, dude.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? I want a challenge. Okay?</p>
<p>My bar. Flip cup. Today. Let's go!</p>
<p>Nah. We've moved on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm over it.</p>
<p>You know what? That's gonna be a pass for me too.</p>
<p>Yeah. I don't feel well at all. They poisoned me.</p>
<p>I'm not feeling it either. So that's gonna be a unanimous no from us.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>God!</p>
<p>Hey, now.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Totally uncalled for.</p>
<p>Who slams a door?</p>
<p>Babies.</p>
<p>That guy's got some real growing up to do. I mean, have some respect, for Christ's sake.</p>
<p>Goddamn savage.</p>
<p>I am a legend.</p>
