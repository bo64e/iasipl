<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Well, this is an interesting development.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You think maybe he's just vacationing?</p>
<p>No. Charlie, there's blocks in front and in back of his tires. He's not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah. This guy's planted himself here.</p>
<p>And I tell you what, once all the other R.</p>
<p>V. Folks see what this R.V. guy is doing, they're gonna start parking their R.</p>
<p>V.'s on our street. shit.</p>
<p>We're gonna be staring down the barrel of a shantytown situation.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Who just takes their vehicle and parks in someone's, you know, street... and says, "This is my street.</p>
<p>I'm gonna live here now 'cause I'm poor"?</p>
<p>I'll tell you who.</p>
<p>New poor. What?</p>
<p>Ever since the recession hit, waves of new people are suddenly broke.</p>
<p>These people have no idea how to live without money.</p>
<p>They're what's called "new poor."</p>
<p>We're old poor.</p>
<p>Yeah, they could stand to learn a lesson or two from us, because we would never take our homelessness and shove it down everybody's face.</p>
<p>Have some class if you're gonna be poor!</p>
<p>All right. Let's get this guy out of here, send him a message.</p>
<p>Let's do it. Right.</p>
<p>Let's slash his tires.</p>
<p>Well, not that though, because then he can't leave.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Well, you start putting plans under microscopes, nothing's gonna make sense, all right?</p>
<p>Lots of things make sense. Slashing someone's tires so that they leave makes no sense.</p>
<p>You gonna put everything I say under a microscope, bud?</p>
<p>It's a stupid idea, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You have a better plan?</p>
<p>Dee! Sharpest item in the bar!</p>
<p>I need it now! Let's go!</p>
<p>Whoa. What the hell's going on over here?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, Frank's trying to kill himself.</p>
<p>Is he all right?</p>
<p>Frank, are you all right?</p>
<p>Don't try to stop me.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, so he's alive. - I lost all my money in a Ponzi scheme, Charlie. I'm broke!</p>
<p>His neck is so thick, I feel like he's just gonna swing and dangle around for a really long time.</p>
<p>That's what it is!</p>
<p>Let's cut him down.</p>
<p>Frank, it's not gonna work for you.</p>
<p>Your neck's too thick, buddy.</p>
<p>Tie a chair to me.</p>
<p>Times are tough, huh?</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What is terrible?</p>
<p>If you're looking for a better steak in an arcade setting, you are shit out of luck.</p>
<p>I'm talking about eating out all the time.</p>
<p>It's a business expense, Frank.</p>
<p>It's only fair that the upper management of the bar get together to talk shop... over top-notch steak and some video games.</p>
<p>You two have no idea how serious this is.</p>
<p>I can't bail you out anymore!</p>
<p>Maybe we should take this time to streamline Paddy's, make it run as efficiently as the government.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Mmm! Yeah.</p>
<p>Cut out the steak dinners.</p>
<p>We're not cutting out the steak dinners, so just hold your horses on that one.</p>
<p>If anything, we should be talking about bonuses.</p>
<p>Let's talk bonuses. Good idea.</p>
<p>Bonuses?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p>You run the business into the ground, and you want bonuses?</p>
<p>Frank, don't be a moron. You start cutting bonuses, you're gonna lose your top guys.</p>
<p>You gotta separate the wheat from the chaff somehow. Yeah.</p>
<p>These dudes are all chaff. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah- Well, no. We're all wheat.</p>
<p>No, we're chaff. No, we're not.</p>
<p>We're- We're wheat.</p>
<p>Why would you want to be wheat?</p>
<p>Why would you ever want to be chaff?</p>
<p>Well, who wants to be- Okay, I'll be chaff, you be wheat.</p>
<p>You two idiots have no business sense whatsoever!</p>
<p>We have no business sense?</p>
<p>He's the one dangling from a noose 10 minutes ago.</p>
<p>[Laughs] That's a good point.</p>
<p>Let's start streamlining right now.</p>
<p>Frank, you're out. You're fired.</p>
<p>Oh! You just got squeezed out, bitch!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm squeezed out?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well, let's see how far you two idiots get... without Frank Reynolds bailing you out every five minutes!</p>
<p>I'm outta here! - I'm comfortable being chaff if you want to be wheat.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, man, whatever.</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: You're firing us?</p>
<p>Well, first we're gonna give you the opportunity to defend your jobs.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. I appreciate the opportunity, fellas.</p>
<p>I'm on it! Whoo! - Good.</p>
<p>Show us what you do around here, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hoo-woo-woo-woo! - Oh, come on!</p>
<p>This is bullshit!</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to defend my job to you!</p>
<p>Dee, we don't know what it is that you do around here.</p>
<p>You don't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>Me? Come on!</p>
<p>I do a shitload!</p>
<p>Why don't you make us a drink?</p>
<p>Fine. I'll crack you open a beer.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Not a beer.</p>
<p>Something you have to mix.</p>
<p>But this bottle is cold-activated.</p>
<p>I mean, look at it.</p>
<p>Doesn't that look delicious?</p>
<p>It does look delicious, but mix me a drink.</p>
<p>But the mountains, they've turned blue.</p>
<p>Mojito me, please.</p>
<p>A refreshing mojito would do.</p>
<p>Nobody orders a mojito in this bar.</p>
<p>So you can't make a mojito?</p>
<p>Of course I can make a mojito!</p>
<p>Then make one. Fine!</p>
<p>One mojito coming up, gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Chuckling]</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>Goddamn it! shit!</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to firing her. Me too.</p>
<p>Okay, boys, let's talk rat traps, okay?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I need money.</p>
<p>Huh? The guys were being total knobs, so I quit.</p>
<p>Also, you're really behind on my rent and they're threatening to evict me, so... money.</p>
<p>What part of "I am broke" don't you guys understand?</p>
<p>I tried to hang myself.</p>
<p>No more bailouts!</p>
<p>Well, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Not my problemo.</p>
<p>What's with the briefcase?</p>
<p>I'm gonna start a new business.</p>
<p>I created an empire before, and I can do it again.</p>
<p>Huh. You are really good at making money.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm in.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What value are you to me?</p>
<p>I'm desperate, so I'll do anything.</p>
<p>Okay, that's good.</p>
<p>Are you willing to destroy your credit?</p>
<p>It's never really been a problem before.</p>
<p>That's good. Hold that.</p>
<p>We're gonna take out a big loan in your name and get an office. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go.</p>
<p>All right, that's the rainwater barrels.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the trash. What do I do with the trash?</p>
<p>How do I dispose of the trash?</p>
<p>I don't know. We disposed of the trash in the Dumpster last night.</p>
<p>What are you doing with it?</p>
<p>I am taking it to the furnace.</p>
<p>We have a furnace? - Absolutely.</p>
<p>Where do you think the heat comes from?</p>
<p>You burn the trash in the furnace?</p>
<p>This bar runs on trash.</p>
<p>This bar is totally green that way.</p>
<p>How is burning trash green?</p>
<p>Uh, because I'm recycling the trash into heat for the bar.</p>
<p>And lots of smoke for the bar. I'm giving the bar the good smoky smell that we all like.</p>
<p>The bar smells like trash.</p>
<p>That's the exact opposite of green, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Well, I could put the trash into a landfill where it's gonna stay for millions of years, or I could burn it up and get a nice, smoky smell in here... and let that smoke go into the sky where it turns into stars.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about stars to dispute it.</p>
<p>It's right. No, it's not right.</p>
<p>All right, are we almost done?</p>
<p>No, we're not done.</p>
<p>I got one more piece of business. What is it?</p>
<p>Lastly, before I open the bar in the morning, I always make sure to turn on the Coors sign, let people know we got iced delicious Coors in the bar, you know, and then, uh, that's the last thing I do.</p>
<p>Ol' Charlie's done a lot of work around here.</p>
<p>Charlie, that sign does not say "Coors." Eh?</p>
<p>Goddamn it. Come outside!</p>
<p>Come outside! Come outside!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Come outside.</p>
<p>Closed!</p>
<p>It says "closed," Charlie!</p>
<p>Okay. [Chuckles] Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I can see that now.</p>
<p>But, you know, you can't really read it from the inside.</p>
<p>You can't read it from the outside!</p>
<p>You know what? Forget it.</p>
<p>I can read it!</p>
<p>Are we done with this?</p>
<p>Have we gone through everything?</p>
<p>Well, that was the last thing that I do, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, great. You're fired!</p>
<p>No, come on.</p>
<p>You're not firing me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry!</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>So you're gonna throw all the trash in the furnace yourselves.</p>
<p>And you're gonna filter the rainwater barrel all by yourselves.</p>
<p>And I suppose you're gonna fiddle with the electricity every day all by yourselves... and siphon it from all around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>No. We're gonna call a trash man, an electrician, and a plumber... and not turn the closed sign on when the bar is open!</p>
<p>[Horn Honking]</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: No, God! What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>This is what I was talking about.</p>
<p>We are gonna have a shantytown here in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: shit! Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Honey, I'm home!</p>
<p>Feast your eyes on the new headquarters of Reynolds and Reynolds.</p>
<p>Frank and I are starting a business.</p>
<p>We sublet our apartments.</p>
<p>We're living in here.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>You subletted our apartment? - Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what the hell, dude?</p>
<p>I don't know if I can live in a trailer, man.</p>
<p>You don't have to, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's kinda tight in there already.</p>
<p>Well, hang on a second, bro.</p>
<p>We're good in tight spaces. I'll make it work.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Charlie.</p>
<p>What do you mean, you're sorry?</p>
<p>There's no room at the inn.</p>
<p>You kidding me, dude? You kidding me?</p>
<p>Unbelievable! So now I'm reduced to sleeping in the bar! Oh, hell no!</p>
<p>No, no, no. You're not gonna be sleeping in the bar.</p>
<p>Where am I gonna live?</p>
<p>On the streets? It's a recession.</p>
<p>Times are tough. Yeah.</p>
<p>You'll bounce back, buddy.</p>
<p>Aw, come on, man.</p>
<p>Can I at least live with you guys?</p>
<p>[Both Laughing]</p>
<p>We're not in the business of giving out handouts, Charlie. We're not the government.</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm a little embarrassed that you would ask.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a little gauche.</p>
<p>You guys are boning me, man.</p>
<p>I tell you what, why don't you and I hit D&amp;B's and talk bonuses?</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. Dennis, why don't you go ahead and lock that door.</p>
<p>You don't have to lock the door.</p>
<p>Go ahead and lock him out.</p>
<p>Keep out the riffraff.</p>
<p>You don't have to lock the door.</p>
<p>You don't have to add insult to injury. I'm gonna be fine.</p>
<p>That's locked?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got plenty of places to go.</p>
<p>No, you don't!</p>
<p>Okay, Frank, tell me about this business scheme you're cooking up.</p>
<p>Give me your shoe.</p>
<p>My shoe?</p>
<p>Hand over your shoe.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Observe.</p>
<p>Wait. No, no, no-</p>
<p>Oh- Aw, come on, man!</p>
<p>That's a $200 shoe!</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Feast your eyes on your new business.</p>
<p>Knives.</p>
<p>You want me to sell knives door-to-door?</p>
<p>No. You're selling vacuums.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I took out a high-interest loan... to invest in a door-to-door knife and vacuum-selling business?</p>
<p>Not just any vacuum.</p>
<p>This is wet vac.</p>
<p>Commercial power for the home.</p>
<p>This'll get a red wine stain out of anything. Look.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>Check it out, Deandra.</p>
<p>All right, this baby is powerful!</p>
<p>Now, cover your ears because it has no muffler!</p>
<p>[Motor Roaring]</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>[Shouts]</p>
<p>[Motor Continues Roaring]</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Oh, that's good merlot.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's good merlot.</p>
<p>You're gonna want to keep those coming.</p>
<p>It might be cheaper if youse went with a bottle of wine... instead of chugging the individual glasses.</p>
<p>Mmm. Yeah, maybe leave the judgment back in the kitchen 'cause...</p>
<p>There's a little bit of a look of judgment on your face. Just go grab them and...</p>
<p>Okay, no problem. All right.</p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Oh, she's terrific.</p>
<p>I like her. Yeah, she's a cutie.</p>
<p>All right, listen, Mac.</p>
<p>I did bring you here for a specific reason, okay? Hmm?</p>
<p>I got an idea for a stimulus plan for the bar that's gonna blow your freakin' mind.</p>
<p>Stimulus plan? A stimulus plan.</p>
<p>You want to hear it?</p>
<p>Lay it on me, bro.</p>
<p>Take a look around you right now.</p>
<p>Now, at a time where businesses are simply failing left and right, who's thriving?</p>
<p>Dave &amp; Buster's. Dave &amp; Buster's is thriving.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>I don't know. Video games?</p>
<p>Video games are definitely a big part of it.</p>
<p>I want you to do me a favor. Break down for me what I'm holding in my hand right now.</p>
<p>Ah, that is a Dave &amp; Buster's Power Card.</p>
<p>Yes. Now, does your Dave &amp; Buster's card work at any other similar establishments?</p>
<p>Like, say, a T.G.I. Fridays?</p>
<p>Mine does not, and believe me, I've tried at several locations. No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause I've actually been with you on many of those occasions where you've tried.</p>
<p>Right. I don't think I've tried it enough.</p>
<p>I think you have.</p>
<p>Because clearly, at this point, you should've realized that it doesn't work anywhere else.</p>
<p>There's one in Franklin Mills I haven't tried.</p>
<p>I feel like that could maybe work.</p>
<p>It's not gonna work there either. Let's move past that.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make a point here.</p>
<p>When you come to Dave &amp; Buster's you spend your real money, but you leave with Dave &amp; Buster's money.</p>
<p>That gives you incentive to come back to Dave &amp; Buster's... 'cause it's the only place where your money works.</p>
<p>I think that's brilliant.</p>
<p>Maybe we should take a page out of D&amp;B's book.</p>
<p>And try the card at the Friday's out in the northeast...</p>
<p>No, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>We're way past that at this point.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you can't grasp that point.</p>
<p>It doesn't work anywhere else.</p>
<p>It's only gonna work here.</p>
<p>All right. I'm- I'm getting all worked up.</p>
<p>Okay? This is- Let's...</p>
<p>I'm proposing that we print our own currency, okay?</p>
<p>Make our own money?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>We call it Paddy's Dollars. Now we distribute that out to people for free initially.</p>
<p>Then they become customers, and then they bring in new customers.</p>
<p>And then once they're in, they have to use real dollars to buy Paddy's Dollars.</p>
<p>That's exactly right, and that stimulates our own internal economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, dude! That's a great plan!</p>
<p>Then afterwards, we'll go out to Fox Chase... and use the Power Card at that Friday's out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah! No, we won't.</p>
<p>You can though.</p>
<p>Look, Mom, um, I've kinda come on some hard times... with the economy and everything.</p>
<p>I got no place to go and everything, so...</p>
<p>I was figuring maybe I should move back into my old room for a little while... till I get back up on my feet.</p>
<p>Mmm, well, I don't think that's gonna work out, Charlie.</p>
<p>Why not? I had to sublet your room to Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>Is that why he's here?</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie.</p>
<p>Times are tough.</p>
<p>And the economy is so bad...</p>
<p>I needed to get more money in in order to make the house payments.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You don't make house payments.</p>
<p>You own this house. You've owned it for years.</p>
<p>Mom, that's crazy.</p>
<p>You collect Social Security.</p>
<p>I need money.</p>
<p>You can share the room with me, Charlie.</p>
<p>[Gasps] That's a great idea!</p>
<p>That is not a great idea.</p>
<p>Well, why not?</p>
<p>It'll be fun.</p>
<p>You know, you and me palling around, getting nuts, doing crazy, fun things.</p>
<p>I'm not doing any kind of things that you want me to do with you, Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>No, it's- it's stuff that relatives do.</p>
<p>We'll share the room, Charlie. - I don't want to share the room with you, dude, because I...</p>
<p>I will spend the whole night wide awake like when I was a kid and you tried to share my room.</p>
<p>You ever seen wrestling on television?</p>
<p>I am well aware of what wrestling is.</p>
<p>It's just not what uncles do to their nephews.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Hey, I'll call you later.</p>
<p>I know you will.</p>
<p>[Woman] Just grab any knife?</p>
<p>Just the sharpest one in the kitchen.</p>
<p>[Whispering] All right, now when I cut through the shoe and make the sale, you suggest casually that we have a drink to celebrate. Right.</p>
<p>And? Then I drop a little wine on the carpet, grab the wet vac, and then call it a deal, whatever. Zing-o.</p>
<p>This is the best knife I own.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh.</p>
<p>All right. Mmm.</p>
<p>Well, if that's the best you have...</p>
<p>All right, now pretend that this shoe is an unboned chicken... and you're gonna cook it tonight and make a tasty dinner... that's gonna smell all through the house like cooked chicken.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm vegan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Then pretend this shoe is whatever you people eat.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a shoe.</p>
<p>Nice one.</p>
<p>Watch the way your knife cuts.</p>
<p>Mmm. Oh, it's just flopping around.</p>
<p>Oh, shoot. I-It, you know, doesn't...</p>
<p>shit's not even making a dent in the leather.</p>
<p>This knife is a piece of crap.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Now take a look at our knife.</p>
<p>Beautiful pressed steel...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>With a nice, razor-sharp edge.</p>
<p>Watch the way this knife blasts through this shoe with one motion.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Owww!</p>
<p>Ohh! Ohh!</p>
<p>Is this part of the whole thing?</p>
<p>Oh, I cut myself!</p>
<p>Ohh! It's a deep cut!</p>
<p>Ohh! Ohh!</p>
<p>I see your bones!</p>
<p>It's a deep cut! - I'll get you a towel!</p>
<p>I'll get you a towel!</p>
<p>Oh, Frank! - It's okay. It's all right.</p>
<p>I got Band-Aids in my bag.</p>
<p>I just- I need your bathroom, that's all.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>I'll just get my bag. Okay.</p>
<p>Ohh! Okay.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Eew.</p>
<p>Is he gonna be okay, 'cause...</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>He's gonna be fine, Beth. Don't worry.</p>
<p>I tell you what- Why don't you and I have a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Just bring it down a little bit, huh?</p>
<p>I don't drink in the morning.</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>Oh, uh...</p>
<p>Oh, shoot!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, I'm missing it!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>You're doing that on purpose!</p>
<p>I'm trying to prove a point here, Beth, okay?</p>
<p>Hmm? I- I don't...</p>
<p>[Stumbling, Crashing]</p>
<p>I'm gonna...</p>
<p>Okay, I-</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, boy.</p>
<p>[Grunting]</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>These Paddy's Dollars look great, bro. - Yeah!</p>
<p>I'm really glad we went with the color.</p>
<p>They pop! Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Little bit more expensive than I would've thought.</p>
<p>But that's worth it though.</p>
<p>That's an old-poor move.</p>
<p>You take your money and put it into something worth it, you're not tacky.</p>
<p>See, by transferring all of our cash into these Paddy's Dollars... and then printing more of these babies than we ever had in cash, we've upped our value.</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Full-blown shantytown.</p>
<p>We're screwed.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.</p>
<p>There could be some real opportunity in this.</p>
<p>Yeah? Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Think about this, dude.</p>
<p>In recession times, what thrives more than anything else?</p>
<p>Prostitutes. No- Well, yeah, that.</p>
<p>But that and bars.</p>
<p>Oh, and bars! Well, yeah!</p>
<p>Right, because people gotta drown their sorrows.</p>
<p>Get drunk!</p>
<p>We own a bar!</p>
<p>Yeah! So why don't we take these Paddy's Dollars... and just distribute them amongst the shanties?</p>
<p>That way- Right. They buy the booze from us with the dollars.</p>
<p>Right. They run out of booze, then they gotta buy more Paddy's Dollars from us.</p>
<p>Thus creating the self-sustaining economy we've been looking for.</p>
<p>It stimulates our economy.</p>
<p>That's what Dave &amp; Buster's does.</p>
<p>Give me one up here.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Who wants some free money, shanties?</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>When people stop buying vacuum cleaners and knives door-to-door, it can mean only one thing, Deandra.</p>
<p>That you blew all of my money on a very stupid idea? No!</p>
<p>Good-bye, recession, hello, depression.</p>
<p>You're very lucky that you're with somebody as resilient as Frank Reynolds.</p>
<p>You've tried to off yourself two times in the last 24 hours, Frank!</p>
<p>Listen, this business partner of mine called.</p>
<p>He's got a great plan.</p>
<p>This is the man who's gonna make us rich.</p>
<p>This is the man?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This man lives in a cardboard box!</p>
<p>Times is tough.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Yo!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>Thanks for getting down here so quick.</p>
<p>It's Charlie?</p>
<p>[Laughing] Hey, Charlie!</p>
<p>Charlie is your new business partner?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, what do you want?</p>
<p>We're good in tight spots.</p>
<p>That's right. All right.</p>
<p>You ready to do this? You got it.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go! Let's go!</p>
<p>You're the man with the plan.</p>
<p>Deandra, this is gonna work.</p>
<p>[Grunting] There we go.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Feast your eyes.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>[Charlie Yells]</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>These are crabs!</p>
<p>Fresh, local Delaware runoff crabs.</p>
<p>Those don't look anything like crabs.</p>
<p>Huh? Yeah, well- They look like sea scorpions.</p>
<p>Isn't there some kind of, like, sewage runoff around here?</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a pretty bad sewage runoff, but, you know, crabs is sewage-proof!</p>
<p>And depression proof.</p>
<p>People gotta eat.</p>
<p>We're gonna sell these on the street.</p>
<p>We're crab people now.</p>
<p>Crab people.</p>
<p>We're crab people now?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You want us to become crab people?</p>
<p>That's your new business plan?</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>[Phone Ringing] Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm getting a call.</p>
<p>We'll live and die by the crab, Dee!</p>
<p>We'll eat off the fat of the sea.</p>
<p>Help me toss some of these babies back, 'cause legally we're not allowed to eat those.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you very much!</p>
<p>Thank you. Great news!</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Forget the crabs! Okay.</p>
<p>Nice doing business with you.</p>
<p>All right, shanty!</p>
<p>Enjoy it! All right.</p>
<p>Enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>I think we made every single one of our Paddy's Dollars back.</p>
<p>You're damn right. Thus creating the self-sustaining economy we've been looking for.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>How much fresh cash did we make?</p>
<p>Fresh cash?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Uh, well, zero. Zero, if you're talking about U.S. currency.</p>
<p>People didn't really seem interested in spending any of that.</p>
<p>That's okay.</p>
<p>So when they run out of the booze, they'll come back in and they'll have to buy more Paddy's Dollars.</p>
<p>Right. That is assuming, of course, that they will come back here and drink.</p>
<p>They will because we'll redistribute these to the shanties, thus ensuring them coming back in, keeping the money moving.</p>
<p>Well, no, if we just redistribute these, then people will continue to drink for free.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How does this work, Mac?</p>
<p>The money keeps moving in a circle.</p>
<p>But- But we don't have any money.</p>
<p>All we have is this.</p>
<p>How does this work, dude?</p>
<p>I don't know. I thought you knew.</p>
<p>I thought you- What?</p>
<p>I thought you were on top of this!</p>
<p>You're the one that came up with the plan!</p>
<p>Did I come up with this plan?</p>
<p>Last night, dude, with the D&amp;B Power Card and the- Oh, I blacked out that night.</p>
<p>shit, dude! I've been following your lead! Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Okay, so we have no money and no inventory.</p>
<p>There's still something we can do.</p>
<p>That's still a business somehow.</p>
<p>How does D&amp;B's do it? They've got a complicated system.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to understand it.</p>
<p>How does a self-sustaining economy work?</p>
<p>I don't understand how the U.S. economy works, much less some sort of a self-sustaining one.</p>
<p>I don't understand how finances work.</p>
<p>Shots for everybody!</p>
<p>The government is reimbursing me all the money I lost!</p>
<p>I love this country!</p>
<p>Baby, I'm back!</p>
<p>Wait, you got a bailout?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know it, pal!</p>
<p>Can you bail us out, Frank?</p>
<p>Because we're kind of screwed here.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it over steaks and Skee-Ball.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>[Laughing, Yelling]</p>
<p>Hey, bailouts all around!</p>
<p>U.S.A.!</p>
<p>U.S.A.! U.S.A.!</p>
<p>I love this country!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Crab meat!</p>
<p>Crab meat! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!</p>
<p>Crab meat!</p>
<p>Crab meat!</p>
<p>Uh, you guys don't think that you're going to Dave &amp; Buster's, do you?</p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p>What?</p>
