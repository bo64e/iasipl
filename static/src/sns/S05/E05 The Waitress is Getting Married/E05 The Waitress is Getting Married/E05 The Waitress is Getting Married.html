<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>It's kind of doing nothing for my hip area and making a mess of my boobs.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Why don't you go grab five more?</p>
<p>Look, we don't normally do this.</p>
<p>But I think I'm gonna need some proof that you're actually getting married.</p>
<p>What? Why?</p>
<p>Because you've been coming in here and trying on wedding dresses every Saturday... for over a year now.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's 'cause it takes a really long time to plan a wedding.</p>
<p>Don't get up all over my balls, Lucy.</p>
<p>Just go get the dresses.</p>
<p>When is the wedding?</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>A church.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>The nearby one.</p>
<p>The nearby one?</p>
<p>Right down the street.</p>
<p>Which street?</p>
<p>Spring.</p>
<p>What's your fianc√©'s name?</p>
<p>Sam.</p>
<p>What does he do?</p>
<p>S-S-Salt.</p>
<p>Salt? Sea... salt.</p>
<p>Sea salt.</p>
<p>He's a salt seaman.</p>
<p>He- He dives in to the ocean for the sea salt.</p>
<p>And then he brings it back up.</p>
<p>And then we eat it.</p>
<p>So- Okay, I'm getting the manager.</p>
<p>Well, don't get the- [Sighs] Damn it.</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Brad Fisher.</p>
<p>From high school.</p>
<p>Brad Fisher.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You look amazing.</p>
<p>Your acne cleared up really well.</p>
<p>I kinda grew into myself.</p>
<p>Yes, you did. Yes, you did.</p>
<p>Why did I ever break up with you, you beefcake?</p>
<p>It was because of the acne.</p>
<p>Was it because of the acne? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, when it got real bad, you dumped me and you said it was 'cause I was gonna grow up to look like Edward James Olmos.</p>
<p>Well, I don't really remember saying exactly that.</p>
<p>It's- It's fine.</p>
<p>We were kids. We were kids.</p>
<p>We were kids!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're not kids anymore.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Great. Wow. So you're- you're getting married. Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, no, I'm not.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>This is because I was.</p>
<p>But that- that didn't work out.</p>
<p>Why are you asking?</p>
<p>Are you single?</p>
<p>What's your situation?</p>
<p>Um, I'm engaged.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that's why I'm here.</p>
<p>My fiance's trying on a dress.</p>
<p>I know I'm not supposed to see it before the wedding.</p>
<p>But we're having a whole nontraditional kinda small thing.</p>
<p>So you should meet her. Babe.</p>
<p>Well, nah...</p>
<p>[Woman] Yeah? - Come here for a second.</p>
<p>I want you to meet a friend of mine.</p>
<p>What do you think of this one, Brad?</p>
<p>It's beautiful, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>[Buzzing] <strong>Mac</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, don't poke at it.</p>
<p>Don't just poke...</p>
<p>Just get it safely into the box.</p>
<p>Dude, you're gonna agitate the bees.</p>
<p>Well, I'm fine with the bees.</p>
<p>It's the honey I don't want to agitate.</p>
<p>Is that your endgame here? Honey?</p>
<p>Yeah. I figure if we keep the hive in the basement, we'll always have honey.</p>
<p>[Buzzing] We'll always have bees is what we'll always have.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>I think I just saw a wasp.</p>
<p>I think that was a wasp.</p>
<p>You see that? Looked like a wasp.</p>
<p>Didn't look like a bee.</p>
<p>Is this a wasp nest?</p>
<p>This is a wasp nest.</p>
<p>I'm out! I'm out!</p>
<p>All right. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don't want to tangle with a bunch of wasps.</p>
<p>Hey! Do- Do wasps make honey?</p>
<p>[Buzzing] No.</p>
<p>Wasps do not make honey.</p>
<p>All right. Well, I'm gonna check it out anyway.</p>
<p>There could be something delicious in here that wasps do make, and I want that.</p>
<p>Mac, Dennis, can I talk to you in the office, please?</p>
<p>Why can't we just talk right here?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Because it's private. Ah, that sounds like a whole thing. I'm not into it.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>[Screaming] shit!</p>
<p>I just got stung! That was a hornet!</p>
<p>This is a hornets nest!</p>
<p>Uh, you know what, guys?</p>
<p>Why don't we step in the back office... while Charlie deals with this whole hornet/wasp situation?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, I'm a bad boy?</p>
<p>I'm a bad boy?</p>
<p>Put some vegetable oil on it.</p>
<p>That'll make you feel better. Okay. Bye, sexy.</p>
<p>Ohh. Who was that?</p>
<p>That's my booty call.</p>
<p>We're into some really weird food fetish stuff.</p>
<p>Gross. Okay, you guys, listen up.</p>
<p>We got a serious problem.</p>
<p>The waitress is getting married.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I heard about that.</p>
<p>Artemis told me.</p>
<p>Since when do you talk to Artemis?</p>
<p>She's my booty call.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>We'll get into that later.</p>
<p>Right now, we gotta deal with this waitress situation.</p>
<p>Dee, why do you give a shit that the waitress is getting married?</p>
<p>She's been nothing but trouble for us.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>She doesn't seem to get our sense of humor.</p>
<p>We do stuff that I think's funny.</p>
<p>She doesn't. Hilarious!</p>
<p>Guys! I cannot believe you're not thinking about Charlie right now.</p>
<p>This is gonna crush him. What?</p>
<p>You don't give a shit about Charlie.</p>
<p>All you care about is the fact the waitress is getting married before you. Right?</p>
<p>That or she's afraid that Charlie might blow his brains out.</p>
<p>And then she'd have to do all the Charlie work.</p>
<p>Uh, that's what it is. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. A: I do not want to do Charlie's work once he kills himself.</p>
<p>B: How could the waitress get married before me?</p>
<p>I'm way hotter than she is.</p>
<p>And C: Get this. The guy she's marrying used to be my boyfriend.</p>
<p>You know what I just realized?</p>
<p>I don't care about anything she's saying.</p>
<p>Not a bit. What I do care about is the fact that...</p>
<p>Charlie might go postal if he finds out about this and kill all of us.</p>
<p>Right. shit. We're probably the ones at real risk here, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe we should find something to distract him... until the whole wedding thing blows over. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Get him his own booty call.</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Or at least another chick to stalk.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Great. In the meantime, I'll try and sabotage the wedding... by luring Brad away from her.</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>
<p>Dee, save yourself the embarrassment.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Let's-</p>
<p>Watch out for the hornets.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don't push me.</p>
<p>[Knocking]</p>
<p>[Door Opens]</p>
<p>Hey-oh!</p>
<p>Hey, what's-</p>
<p>Ahh!</p>
<p>What are you doing there, buddy?</p>
<p>I'm trying to smoke these hornets to death so I can get their honey.</p>
<p>They keep flying up the tube, stinging me on my face.</p>
<p>I think I just swallowed one.</p>
<p>As I tried to explain before, you cannot get honey from a hornets nest.</p>
<p>I just don't think there's any science to support that, buddy.</p>
<p>There's some very basic science out there supporting that. No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Trust me, pal.</p>
<p>It's a fact. It's not even science.</p>
<p>Why are you bothering... getting into it with him?</p>
<p>I don't know. I just feel like...</p>
<p>Charlie, we're gonna get you back on the dating scene, bro.</p>
<p>What do you think about that? Yeah.</p>
<p>That's actually why we're here.</p>
<p>We're gonna put your profile on Match.com.</p>
<p>I don't see why.</p>
<p>I got the waitress, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Sure, right.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, totally.</p>
<p>We thought maybe you could meet somebody new. Yeah.</p>
<p>Someone you like even more than the waitress.</p>
<p>I don't see how that's possible.</p>
<p>But I tell you what, let me pop a quick "H" on this box.</p>
<p>This way we all know it's filled with the hornets.</p>
<p>Okay? Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Do what you gotta do.</p>
<p>These things sting like a bitch, man.</p>
<p>First thing we gotta do is take your picture for the profile. So...</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>
<p>So, do you have the makeup?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, no makeup! Come on.</p>
<p>Well, those hornet stings are pretty bad, buddy.</p>
<p>So I think we're gonna have to...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I am who I am.</p>
<p>Right. But-</p>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
<p>Let's do who you are minus the hornet stings.</p>
<p>Let's pretend you're not who you are and just try to attract a woman.</p>
<p>I tell you what. What if I wore a checkered hat and I smoked a pipe? That'd work.</p>
<p>Why would you want a checkered hat and a pipe?</p>
<p>You know, for the Sherlock Holmes look.</p>
<p>Why would you want to look like Sherlock Holmes?</p>
<p>Who are you trying to attract exactly?</p>
<p>Intelligent women.</p>
<p>Okay. I'm just gonna take the photo right now without the makeup... and see if he likes it. Ready?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ooh, that felt good.</p>
<p>Was that sexy? - That's very...</p>
<p>That felt sexy.</p>
<p>We'll Photoshop it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see where this is going.</p>
<p>Let's just not do that.</p>
<p>We'll just Photoshop it.</p>
<p>Let's- Let's- You want to take another one?</p>
<p>No. No. We'll find another picture that we can use and that'll be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's talk about your likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>How about your favorite food.</p>
<p>What would that be? - Oh, milk steak.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Hmm? What?</p>
<p>Milk steak.</p>
<p>I'm not putting milk steak.</p>
<p>Just put steak. Just put regular steak.</p>
<p>And then- I'm gonna put steak.</p>
<p>Put milk steak.</p>
<p>She'll know what it is.</p>
<p>She won't know. Nobody knows what that is.</p>
<p>She'll know what it is.</p>
<p>No- Okay, all right.</p>
<p>What's your favorite hobby?</p>
<p>Uh, magnets.</p>
<p>Magnets? Okay, what, like making magnets, collecting magnets?</p>
<p>Playing with magnets?</p>
<p>Just magnets.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put snowboarding. We'll put snowboarding.</p>
<p>I don't really snowboard.</p>
<p>All right, what are some of your likes?</p>
<p>Uh, ghouls.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>What are you talking about now?</p>
<p>You know, funny little green ghouls, go- What?</p>
<p>What, like in movies and cartoons?</p>
<p>What are you- - Little green ghouls, buddy.</p>
<p>Don't write ghouls! I'm not.</p>
<p>I'm putting travel.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ! What are your dislikes?</p>
<p>People's knees.</p>
<p>Come on! Come on! You gotta be kidding.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We'll make it up. We'll make the whole thing up.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here!</p>
<p>We'll doctor the picture.</p>
<p>We're not even gonna use you.</p>
<p>Cover your knees up if you're gonna be walking around everywhere.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Bingo, bitch.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>[Horns Honking] - Hey.</p>
<p>You guys, how are you?</p>
<p>[Horns Honking]</p>
<p>All right, calm down!</p>
<p>I'll be two seconds!</p>
<p>Anyway, hi! How are you?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Okay, so listen up. I was thinking since, Brad, you were saying... how your wedding was gonna be all poor or boring or dull or whatever it was you were...</p>
<p>You said our wedding was gonna be dull?</p>
<p>I said it was gonna be small.</p>
<p>Small! Yup, that's exactly what it was.</p>
<p>I was thinking I could help you guys out by throwing you a bachelorette party!</p>
<p>Brad, you can totally come since you guys decided to do that nontraditional mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>I think we're good.</p>
<p>You know what, though.</p>
<p>I kinda would like to meet some of your friends.</p>
<p>Hold on here. Hold on.</p>
<p>What am I hearing?</p>
<p>You haven't met some of her great friends?</p>
<p>It's just because this happened really quickly.</p>
<p>Is it a yes or a no? 'Cause you're kinda holding up traffic here. It's- It's rude.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Come on, lady!</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Look, I think it sounds great.</p>
<p>It sounds like fun. Okay, perfect!</p>
<p>Wonderful! We've got a deal.</p>
<p>See you guys tomorrow night, my place, at 8:00.</p>
<p>[Horns Honking] Bye, Brad.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Okay! Calm down, dick wads!</p>
<p>It wasn't that bad!</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™ [Pop]</p>
<p>[Coughing]</p>
<p>Deandra, you got any bacon bits?</p>
<p>We like to put 'em in Artemis's hair and they rain down on me when we bang.</p>
<p>I feel like a Cobb salad.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<p>Okay. I have no idea why anyone would want to feel like a Cobb salad.</p>
<p>But whatever, that's good.</p>
<p>Bring that up when Brad's here.</p>
<p>All right, Mrs. Mac, make sure that you talk... about how the waitress looks exactly like you when you were young, right?</p>
<p>You remember that? There's a whole carton of cigarettes in it for you.</p>
<p>[Coughing]</p>
<p>Uh, Mrs. Kelly, remember, this man that I'm bringing over, he wants to steal the love of your son's life away.</p>
<p>Nobody hurts my Charlie!</p>
<p>Yup, that's good. That's good. Keep that up.</p>
<p>And keep the drinking coming.</p>
<p>'Cause it makes you get all weird.</p>
<p>All right, this is- - [Knocking]</p>
<p>Oh, okay. They're here. Is everyone ready?</p>
<p>You guys got it? Okay.</p>
<p>[Clears Throat] There they are!</p>
<p>Sorry we're late.</p>
<p>Somebody took a little convincing.</p>
<p>Yup. I really didn't want to come, but Brad insisted.</p>
<p>Oh, you big, old, fat stick in the mud!</p>
<p>Come on in, you guys.</p>
<p>They're here, everybody!</p>
<p>[Groans]</p>
<p>What's up? - Here you go.</p>
<p>Would you like some punch?</p>
<p>Is there alcohol in this?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not. I remember what an embarrassing problem you have with alcohol.</p>
<p>Brad, did you know about her unfortunate problems with drug and alcohol?</p>
<p>Isn't that sad?</p>
<p>It's just alcohol.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>And he's aware.</p>
<p>Oh. Really?</p>
<p>I thought there was, like, cocaine and heroin.</p>
<p>And remember when you were shooting up with the homeless people... and banging for money on the street?</p>
<p>No. no.</p>
<p>Wow. You're making all of that up.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You're absolutely right. I'm confusing you with another pathetic drunk that I know.</p>
<p>So you can still have fun, can't you, Brad? I can. I...</p>
<p>Let's get a beer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whoo-hoo.</p>
<p>You look really nice tonight.</p>
<p>You like that?</p>
<p>You like that?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: The color of this shirt. I don't know what it's doing to your eyes, but I like it.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™ [Continues]</p>
<p>All right, listen. You gotta be on your toes tonight, okay?</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™ [Fades Out]</p>
<p>This chick's a lawyer.</p>
<p>She's gonna be pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Stick to the game plan, okay?</p>
<p>She's a lawyer. I like that.</p>
<p>He's sweating through his shirt, dude.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Listen, you remember your backstory?</p>
<p>No? Oh, for God's sakes!</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I don't remember the backstory.</p>
<p>All right, listen, man. You're a philanthropist.</p>
<p>That's what you are, okay?</p>
<p>You used to own a small business.</p>
<p>But you gave all that up to help others.</p>
<p>All right, who do I help?</p>
<p>Who am I helping?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. I don't know, old people, uh, children, autistics, dyslexic folks.</p>
<p>It really doesn't matter, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm a full on re...</p>
<p>Ph-Philio- Philian-</p>
<p>Philanthropist.</p>
<p>Dude, I can't get it.</p>
<p>How do you say it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Together</strong>: Philanthropist!</p>
<p>Meet us in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude! What is that?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Is that cheese?</p>
<p>Have you eaten cheese?</p>
<p>How much cheese have you eaten today?</p>
<p>How much cheese is too much cheese?</p>
<p>Any amount of cheese before a date is too much cheese!</p>
<p>I had a lot of cheese.</p>
<p>I had a block of cheese.</p>
<p>Okay, okay- You ate a block of cheese today?</p>
<p>I was very nervous.</p>
<p>I started eating cheese, man.</p>
<p>All right. All right, all right.</p>
<p>Does that calm you down?</p>
<p>Just don't breathe in her direction, okay?</p>
<p>Whatever you do.</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>Stick to the game plan.</p>
<p>Do I look handsome?</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>So I thought we would play a game.</p>
<p>Sort of a newlywed-type of game.</p>
<p>And see how well you two know each other, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, question number one.</p>
<p>Who broke Brad's heart in high school and feels really bad about it?</p>
<p>Me. I broke Brad's heart in high school and I feel really bad about it. Okay?</p>
<p>Wait. You went to high school with us?</p>
<p>Yeah. I sat right next to you in trig.</p>
<p>Huh! Wow.</p>
<p>You are very forgettable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will have you all know that I also broke Brad's heart in high school. So...</p>
<p>You dated Dee?</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Briefly. Yeah.</p>
<p>We dated hard, yep. - Both you girls dumped him because of his pizza face.</p>
<p>Ooh! Okay.</p>
<p>Question number two.</p>
<p>How many people in the room have had sex with the bride-to-be?</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Uh, just me I hope.</p>
<p>Ooh. - Whoops. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Over here, guy.</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>That was a- That was a really dark time in my life, and it was a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>No, it's true. To be fair, it's true.</p>
<p>She's in love with my brother.</p>
<p>They have a sex tape together.</p>
<p>This guy came along- No.</p>
<p>I used to look like her.</p>
<p>Give me my cigarettes.</p>
<p>Okay, I- I didn't tell you to go.</p>
<p>I didn't give you the high sign.</p>
<p>Everybody's stealing my Charlie, girl!</p>
<p>Oh! What the hell! - Okay, Brad.</p>
<p>I think it's time for us to go.</p>
<p>We're gonna leave.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Wait, no. No, no, no, no, Brad.</p>
<p>No, don't leave yet. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Hold on. No, no, don't leave.</p>
<p>Oh, you bitch!</p>
<p>Oh! Goddamn it!</p>
<p>I should be the one getting married!</p>
<p>This is depressing. Want to go get sweaty in the bathroom? Sure do.</p>
<p>No! No one's getting sweaty in my bathroom!</p>
<p>Just get out of here!</p>
<p>Okay. We'll go get sweaty in a Wendy's bathroom.</p>
<p>Great! Go have sex at Wendy's!</p>
<p>Go for a ride.</p>
<p>Wonderful!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>This party sucks!</p>
<p>You suck!</p>
<p>I need a ride. - Oh, really?</p>
<p>Well, I ain't giving you shit, you old bitch!</p>
<p>[Knocking] - Oh, my God, no!</p>
<p>You can't borrow salad dressing!</p>
<p>Or condiments! Or anything else you two want to jam up into each other's...</p>
<p>I, uh-</p>
<p>I forgot something.</p>
<p>Oh. What?</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you...</p>
<p>I still love you.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Are you Charlie Kelly?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late. Um-</p>
<p>You're Jackie.</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>[Laughs] Are you all right?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, this?</p>
<p>I was running.</p>
<p>Okay, because y-you're bleeding.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Is it bleeding again?</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>These are hornet stings, you know?</p>
<p>I run into, like- like a lot of, like, hornets in my line of work.</p>
<p>And I get stung up, like, bad all over my face and stuff.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it starts bleeding. Oh.</p>
<p>It sounds interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is it that you do again?</p>
<p>I'm work- I'm like a janitor at, um...</p>
<p>I'm a full-on rapist, you know?</p>
<p>Uh, Africans, dyslexics, children, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Did you say you're a full-on rapist?</p>
<p>No! Did I say that?</p>
<p>No! No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>I help- I help people.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I'm...</p>
<p>I'm a philan- a philan- a philan...</p>
<p>A philanthropist? Yeah!</p>
<p>That's exactly what it is.</p>
<p>It gets blocked up in my mouth.</p>
<p>I don't say it no good, so...</p>
<p>I'm a janitor at a bar.</p>
<p>Oh, God, dude!</p>
<p>I'm sucking ass!</p>
<p>Yeah, dude.</p>
<p>You said you were a rapist!</p>
<p>I went crazy in the brain for a second!</p>
<p>Yeah. And my eyes were all like, uh- And I couldn't think straight.</p>
<p>That shirt is ruined. I know, dude.</p>
<p>Give me your shirt.</p>
<p>What? Give you-</p>
<p>That's a totally different shirt.</p>
<p>Yeah. Can I- How the hell are you gonna explain that to her?</p>
<p>I'll say I met a nice guy in the bathroom and we traded shirts!</p>
<p>Are you listening to yourself?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>I'm freaking out, dude.</p>
<p>Okay, new plan. New plan. New plan.</p>
<p>Charlie, make a move.</p>
<p>Just tell her you want to bang her.</p>
<p>Ooh. No, that's- Is that how you get chicks?</p>
<p>Well, he's got a 50-50 shot.</p>
<p>That's a good point!</p>
<p>It is a yes-or-no scenario.</p>
<p>It is a no scenario!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Don't approach her that way.</p>
<p>That's not gonna work. Am I getting the shirt?</p>
<p>You're not gonna get the shirt.</p>
<p>This is what you're gonna do.</p>
<p>Go back out there.</p>
<p>Start asking her questions about herself.</p>
<p>Talk to her about being a lawyer, okay?</p>
<p>I can do that.</p>
<p>Right? Right?</p>
<p>That's gonna work.</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong, I'll come out there, I'll say I'm the manager of Gugino's.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right? I got it.</p>
<p>I know. I understand it.</p>
<p>You good?</p>
<p>We'll be good.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>[Groaning]</p>
<p>Just go. Just get out there.</p>
<p>Just go. Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p>It took a little while.</p>
<p>There was a guy in the bathroom.</p>
<p>He wouldn't give me his shirt. And I was fighting him.</p>
<p>I'm, like, "Give me your shirt, bro.</p>
<p>" And he didn't want to give it to me.</p>
<p>And it was like a whole thing.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, uhh!</p>
<p>Hi. Uh, I'm the manager. And Mr.</p>
<p>Kelly is one of our preferred customers.</p>
<p>It's so wonderful to see you here again this evening. Right. My good man.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna want the milk steak boiled over hard... and a side of your finest jellybeans, raw. [Laughs]</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, you have the most wonderful sense of humor.</p>
<p>Hey, I own this joint.</p>
<p>And I know this guy. And he is loaded.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, we have your milk boiling just the way you like it back there for your steak.</p>
<p>You're gonna like this.</p>
<p>How's about I clear out the coat room... and you guys hit it in there while the steak is getting ready?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What in the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>He's gonna be aggressive.</p>
<p>I've got this.</p>
<p>Charlie, make a move. Maul.</p>
<p>No, don't-</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm leaving!</p>
<p>You're grabbing her breasts?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I don't know. What does "make a move" mean?</p>
<p>It doesn't mean stab at her breasts with your fingers. Oh, man!</p>
<p>Come on, bro. You're ordering milk steak and jellybeans? What the hell?</p>
<p>Come on, you guys blew it, dude!</p>
<p>We blew it?</p>
<p>I told you to stick with the game plan!</p>
<p>It was going great! I had it!</p>
<p>You don't know shit about chicks, man!</p>
<p>We don't know shit about chicks?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Well, guess what, bro. The waitress is getting married. So suck on that!</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I'll be taking that milk steak to go then.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so the Wendy's manager is all, "You gotta clean that up!"</p>
<p>And I said, "They're your hamburgers.</p>
<p>You clean 'em up."</p>
<p>And then Artemis got all bummed out... because of something I did with the onions to myself.</p>
<p>And now she won't talk to me.</p>
<p>Frank, I don't give a shit about any of this.</p>
<p>Hey, man, where's the baseball bat?</p>
<p>Baseball bat in the corner.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We're trying to arm ourselves 'cause Charlie's gonna be here any minute, and he might take us out, so...</p>
<p>Oh, don't worry about Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie's over this.</p>
<p>In fact, I saw him this morning.</p>
<p>He said he was bringing the guy a congratulatory gift.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>[Doorbell Buzzes]</p>
<p>Hey, what's- what's, uh- what's this?</p>
<p>This is for your engagement, man.</p>
<p>You're a lucky, lucky dude.</p>
<p>And, uh, congratulations to you.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>No, no, no. That's not happening anymore.</p>
<p>We're not, uh- We're not engaged.</p>
<p>You're not getting married?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You're Charlie Kelly, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I remember you from high school.</p>
<p>Hang on a second, dude.</p>
<p>You're not getting married?</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>[Clears Throat]</p>
<p>Remember how everybody used to make fun of us in high school?</p>
<p>I remember how they made fun of you.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have been getting my revenge.</p>
<p>I've been getting engaged to all these chicks who broke up with me in high school...</p>
<p>'cause of my acne, and then I dump 'em right before the wedding.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Damn.</p>
<p>Yeah. I just got through doing it to that coffee shop waitress.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna do it to this chick Dee Reynolds. Remember her?</p>
<p>She was the worst.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, so that coffee shop waitress, she must've been hurt kinda bad by that though, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>She was- She was devastated.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Well, tell you what, man. Why don't you go ahead and have this present anyway?</p>
<p>Really? Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like you deserve it.</p>
<p>[Chuckles] Well, thanks, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's- That's rad.</p>
<p>All right. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, keep it real, man.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
