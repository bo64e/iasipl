<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly here, local business owner and cat enthusiast.</p>
<p>Is your cat making too much noise all the time?</p>
<p>Is your cat constantly stomping around, driving you crazy?</p>
<p>[Roaring] [Glass Shattering]</p>
<p>Is your cat clawing at your furnitures?</p>
<p>[Growling]</p>
<p>Think there's no answer?</p>
<p>You're so stupid! There is.</p>
<p>Kitten Mittens.</p>
<p>Finally, there's an elegant, comfortable mitten for cats.</p>
<p>[Crickets Chirping]</p>
<p>[Cat Yowls]</p>
<p>I couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p>Is your cat one-legged?</p>
<p>Is your cat fat, skinny or an in-between?</p>
<p>That doesn't matter, 'cause one size fits all.</p>
<p>Kitten Mittens.</p>
<p>You'll be smitten.</p>
<p>So come on down to Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>We're the home of the original Kitten Mittens.</p>
<p>Mee-ow!</p>
<p>[Button Clicks]</p>
<p>So, lately at night, I've been forced to fall asleep to the deafening sound... of, like, a hundred alley cats tapping on my windows, trying to get in.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Thus, Kitten Mittens.</p>
<p>Right? I'm making a quieter cat.</p>
<p>And then I made the sales tape when I heard about the merchandising convention.</p>
<p>Ooh, question.</p>
<p>Mac, go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Uh, what merchandising convention?</p>
<p>They're having one down at the Sheraton. All right?</p>
<p>So I figured, what a better place to, like, find investors for my product.</p>
<p>What do moronic Kitten Mittens have to do with our bar?</p>
<p>Okay. One, they're not moronic.</p>
<p>They're awesome. <strong>Dennis</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p>And two, uh, nothing.</p>
<p>Look, Charlie, I kinda like this.</p>
<p>I might jump in on this with you here.</p>
<p>I think it's a good idea.</p>
<p>We could do T-shirts.</p>
<p>We could do beach towels, those nudie pens.</p>
<p>[Laughs] Okay. It's about time, you know, we get some merchandise in here, and I start making some money off this place. What?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You're not gonna make any money of this place.</p>
<p>You don't own a piece of the bar.</p>
<p>No, but I own... a hundred percent of the merchandising.</p>
<p>It's in my contract.</p>
<p>What contract?</p>
<p>The contract you had me sign when I first started working here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>[Scoffs] [Laughs]</p>
<p>Dee, we got you to sign that contract so we could pay you less than minimum wage.</p>
<p>Okay? We're never gonna merchandise anything in the bar.</p>
<p>But now we are.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't even remember signing any kind of contract.</p>
<p>Oh, you don't remember?</p>
<p>Did it slip your mind?</p>
<p>That's okay, 'cause it's right here.</p>
<p>I keep it in this drawer so that you two jerks don't try...</p>
<p>Hey, hey! Wait!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>That doesn't nullify it, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, why?</p>
<p>Do you have another copy?</p>
<p>I... don't.</p>
<p>I don't, but you can't just go eat a contract!</p>
<p>He just did eat it. - All right.</p>
<p>I'm talking to a lawyer about this.</p>
<p>You don't have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>This is making me think maybe I should slap a patent... on my Kitten Mittens before you guys try and steal that too, huh?</p>
<p>I can see it in your eyes.</p>
<p>You're all over this, aren't you?</p>
<p>[Swallows] You know, I gotta say, Mac, my instinct to steal this idea is very strong.</p>
<p>Kitten Mittens? No, idiot.</p>
<p>Merchandising in the bar.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm thinking we take this merchandising convention... as an opportunity to make merchandise for Paddy's. Right.</p>
<p>You know? Like, expand our brand.</p>
<p>You know? Make a little "mon-ay"!</p>
<p>Who's gonna buy merchandise to a bar that they've never been to?</p>
<p>Uh, hello, Frank.</p>
<p>[Chuckles]</p>
<p>I've never been to Fiji.</p>
<p>All right. Well, how about, like, hard-boiled eggs from Paddy's Bar?</p>
<p>Green eggs.</p>
<p>Says "Paddy's" on them.</p>
<p>You keep them on your desk when you go to work.</p>
<p>Who's gonna want to keep a hard-boiled egg on their desk at work?</p>
<p>Oh, all right. Then you put it on your dashboard of your car.</p>
<p>It's just a jumping-off point.</p>
<p>Frank, keeping hard-boiled eggs... on your desktop or the dashboard of your car is not a jumping-off point.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here, all right?</p>
<p>Let us concentrate on doing the merchandising idea.</p>
<p>Clearly you don't get it.</p>
<p>So I don't want- I don't get it?</p>
<p>You don't get it!</p>
<p>I don't get it?</p>
<p>You don't get it! Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>We'll see who doesn't get it!</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>All right, Charlie. Remember, this lawyer is not a big fan of ours.</p>
<p>So we're probably gonna have to turn the charm up a little bit in the beginning.</p>
<p>Know what I mean?</p>
<p>I got a plan on how we can do that too.</p>
<p>See this picture of his wife right here? Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What if we compliment her good looks?</p>
<p>That gets us off on a good foot, right?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>That woman looks like a stone-cold bitch, and you know it.</p>
<p>And he knows it 'cause he turns the picture away from him.</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying to make lemonade here. Oh!</p>
<p>Ooh, there he is.</p>
<p>How did you get in here?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Aw, we just...</p>
<p>There's the man! The old-fashioned way- with doors and feet and walking.</p>
<p>You know, we were just having a conversation about how lovely your wife is.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Very lovely.</p>
<p>I was not participating in that conversation, 'cause I don't find her lovely.</p>
<p>I think you're better than that.</p>
<p>I think you can do better than that.</p>
<p>And I mean that as a compliment.</p>
<p>You are aware that there are other lawyers in Philadelphia?</p>
<p>But the three of us have a history.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We, uh- We have a past, if you will.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And Charlie and I really like the fact that you don't charge.</p>
<p>I do charge.</p>
<p>Okay? You don't pay.</p>
<p>We're both men of the law.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>We get after it. You know?</p>
<p>We jabber-jaw. We go tit for tat.</p>
<p>We have our little differences.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, you win some, I win some, and there's a mutual respect left over between us. No.</p>
<p>Any respect that you're feeling that's coming from me is a mistake on your part.</p>
<p>Then I'll just regress, 'cause I feel like I've made myself perfectly redundant.</p>
<p>Yes, you have.</p>
<p>I'm lost.</p>
<p>So I'm just gonna get down to brass tacks.</p>
<p>I got a question for you.</p>
<p>Does a legal document hold up in a court of law if it has been ingested by the other party?</p>
<p>I'm not- - Now, mind you, the heretofore document... had- had dry ink on it for at least many "forknights," uh, hereto- We signed it a long time ago.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago signed.</p>
<p>I'm also gonna need a patent for the Kitten Mittens.</p>
<p>I'm sure you do. I was gonna ask you, "Hey, need Kitten Mitten patents?"</p>
<p>That's them.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir.</p>
<p>But they locked me in a closet.</p>
<p>Yo, dude, dude, dude.</p>
<p>I'm ready to show you my idea.</p>
<p>Me too. All right, let me go first, bro.</p>
<p>Let me show you mine, then you can go first.</p>
<p>Then I'd be going second.</p>
<p>Yeah, great. Okay, now listen.</p>
<p>When we're selling stuff... at Paddy's, I think we need to be selling a certain attitude, right?</p>
<p>One that reflects our take-no-prisoners, rock-and-roll lifestyle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah. Now what says that more than this?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Paddy's thong, dude!</p>
<p>Paddy's thong!</p>
<p>You're wearing women's underwear?</p>
<p>Yeah, bro!</p>
<p>You bet your ass I'm wearing women's underwear.</p>
<p>What's more sexual than a high-waisted thong riding high up a woman's backside?</p>
<p>Nothing. Dude, come on.</p>
<p>Paddy's thong is gonna be a huge hit with chicks.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Uh, question.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mac. Go.</p>
<p>Dennis, are women gonna wanna buy their underpants in a bar?</p>
<p>No. Women will not buy their underwear in a bar, but men will buy the underwear for their women in a bar... because it's not for women, it's for men.</p>
<p>It's a visual stimulant, bro.</p>
<p>I'm not wearing these because I'm comfortable.</p>
<p>I'm wearing them because I want to turn you on.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>You get it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro. It's visual stimulation.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I go now?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, I'm thinking to myself, what do people love more than anything else in the world?</p>
<p>They love comedy!</p>
<p>They do love comedy.</p>
<p>Everybody loves comedy, right?</p>
<p>So- And I'm funny. I can do funny.</p>
<p>But you gotta have functionality with your comedy, okay?</p>
<p>Right. You can't just go throwing jokes around willy-nilly.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So I did one of those.</p>
<p>You drew a men's buttocks on a towel. Yeah.</p>
<p>You get out of the shower in the college dorm.</p>
<p>They got the butt, right?</p>
<p>People are laughing. Okay.</p>
<p>Your buddies are laughing.</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>And then you give them one of these.</p>
<p>Boom! [Laughs]</p>
<p>Oh, that is big!</p>
<p>That's a big monster dick.</p>
<p>That's huge.</p>
<p>That's the biggest dick you ever seen.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's really- That's not how you see yourself though?</p>
<p>Now that's funny. That's funny.</p>
<p>That is funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are gonna laugh at that.</p>
<p>But, bro, that's just the setup.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>For this.</p>
<p>Ding-ding-ding!</p>
<p>Oh, it's a baby dick.</p>
<p>Yeah! We're gonna sell a million of these, dude.</p>
<p>We are gonna sell a million of those, dude.</p>
<p>We'll do black ones... and yellow ones for the Asians.</p>
<p>That is probably more Asian than anything else.</p>
<p>Dude- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Maybe a little bit more bush.</p>
<p>We should set up a Web site for it.</p>
<p>Already did it.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Dicktowel.com.</p>
<p>Dicktowel.com.</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>Well, you don't think I know what's going on?</p>
<p>Huh? Oh, Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>I don't get it? Huh?</p>
<p>Open your mouth, bitch. What?</p>
<p>Prepare to be blasted, bitch!</p>
<p>Brenda! [Muffled Screaming]</p>
<p>[Groans, Spits, Coughs]</p>
<p>[Frank Laughs]</p>
<p>This is my new merchandising idea.</p>
<p>It's a gun that shoots liquor into your mouth!</p>
<p>You threw tequila in my eye!</p>
<p>Well, I haven't figured out how to get the tequila to come out of the barrel of the gun.</p>
<p>But I'm working on it.</p>
<p>What the hell does she have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Check her out.</p>
<p>I mean, she's gorgeous.</p>
<p>You bring a woman with cans like that into the convention, you sell the idea in a second.</p>
<p>So this is your plan?</p>
<p>You're gonna go into the convention... waving a gun in people's faces, throwing tequila in everybody's eyes... with a big-titted woman?</p>
<p>Duh, yeah!</p>
<p>Frank, get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>Your ideas are ridiculous!</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Suck on this, bitches.</p>
<p>Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>Paddy's Pub stress ball.</p>
<p>You give this to people.</p>
<p>They put it on their desk.</p>
<p>And then during the day, you squeeze it when you have any tension.</p>
<p>Right. Oh, goddamn it, Frank!</p>
<p>That's just an egg!</p>
<p>It's a jumping-off point.</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>All right. Get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>Just get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>Don't even listen to them.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying? Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Okay, we're stealing that gun shot idea, right?</p>
<p>Gun shot idea's awesome.</p>
<p>You see any sign of that lawyer or his secretary?</p>
<p>No, and I don't know why you think we're gonna catch him having an affair.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy's wife is really hot.</p>
<p>No, she's not.</p>
<p>And also, why does he turn her picture away from him... so he doesn't have to look at her face?</p>
<p>Why are we in this shady motel where we saw him go in?</p>
<p>I'm telling you, he's- he's banging that secretary.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It just doesn't add up.</p>
<p>She's an attractive lady, you know?</p>
<p>She's not attractive.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The woman in the room right next to him... she just ate an entire sleeve of Chips Ahoy!</p>
<p>Charlie, could you focus on the lawyer's room, please?</p>
<p>We're not here to blackmail a lady for eating too many cookies.</p>
<p>Did you say an entire sleeve though?</p>
<p>An entire sleeve.</p>
<p>That's a lot of cookies.</p>
<p>She a big lady?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p>She's a humongous lady. Yeah. Of course.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. I see him. He's walking towards the car.</p>
<p>He's walking towards the car!</p>
<p>Get down! Shh!</p>
<p>Why is he coming towards us?</p>
<p>Get down and hold still!</p>
<p>[Door Opens] [Sighs] [Door Closes]</p>
<p>All right. Um, so what are you people doing in my car now?</p>
<p>Okay, let me explain that.</p>
<p>Uh- Yeah.</p>
<p>We were staking you out last night- kinda spying on you. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>It got a little cold. It dropped down, right?</p>
<p>It was freezing, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Did you feel that? So we jimmied your lock and spent the night in here.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, so why were you spying on me all night?</p>
<p>Because you're having an affair, and we're gonna blackmail you for your services.</p>
<p>Okay. I hate to disappoint you, but I am not having an affair.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Then why do you turn your wife's picture away from your desk... so you don't have to look at her face?</p>
<p>Why are you staying in this seedy motel?</p>
<p>And why does it look like you've been crying all night?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what I think.</p>
<p>I think you feel guilty.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>If you must know, my wife is leaving me.</p>
<p>And I have to sleep in this fleabag motel.</p>
<p>And I am still very much in love with my wife, which makes this divorce very difficult.</p>
<p>Thus you have the turning away of the photo... and you have, you know, the crying episodes, and the what-have-you.</p>
<p>Mmm. Sad.</p>
<p>Okay, that's our bad.</p>
<p>We, uh...</p>
<p>It all comes together- That makes a lot of sense though.</p>
<p>In a different way than I thought.</p>
<p>God, divorce is tough.</p>
<p>The picture sort of coming together for you all?</p>
<p>You must be all ripped up about that.</p>
<p>So, um- Do you want to have a conversation... about helping us out with our Kitten Mitten patent and...</p>
<p>I thought this contract-</p>
<p>You know what? If, um...</p>
<p>Why don't you get out of my car?</p>
<p>We should go now.</p>
<p>Why don't you just get out of my car?</p>
<p>You've had a hard couple of days.</p>
<p>Okay, consumer, are you ready to get blasted in the mouth by Paddy's Shotgun?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One, two, three!</p>
<p>[Gargles] Ah!</p>
<p>Goddamn it, dude!</p>
<p>You just cannot blast water out of a gun.</p>
<p>The technology is just not there.</p>
<p>They did sort of figure it out with water guns, so I don't know why...</p>
<p>Yeah, but a water gun doesn't have the same feel to it, you know?</p>
<p>It doesn't. You want to feel the weight of a real gun in your mouth.</p>
<p>You want to taste the metal.</p>
<p>You want to feel the steel, man, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, bro, new plan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's just make a video, show that at the convention.</p>
<p>Not like Charlie's video though.</p>
<p>Ours needs to be cool.</p>
<p>No, no, no, dude.</p>
<p>Way cooler than Charlie's.</p>
<p>With, like, quick cuts and awesome music... and eagles flying through the air and picking up trout out of rivers and shit.</p>
<p>Ripping it apart and eating it, you know?</p>
<p>It's so cool.</p>
<p>That'll excite people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They'll want to invest.</p>
<p>Then we'll let the brainiacs in China figure out the technology.</p>
<p>Yeah. But the point is- is it's got to really grab people's attention.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? All right.</p>
<p>I did a little tweaking and...</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Paddy's Shotgun, bro!</p>
<p>You get blasted in the mouth!</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>You stole my idea! - No, no, no, Frank.</p>
<p>We tweaked your idea.</p>
<p>We took what was a good idea and we made it a great idea.</p>
<p>We're also gonna get a bustier chick.</p>
<p>No offense, ma'am.</p>
<p>You're very busty.</p>
<p>Your breasts are very large.</p>
<p>But, uh, we want to go weird with it.</p>
<p>We want to get really freakish.</p>
<p>I would like to get your number, actually, though at some point.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.</p>
<p>You can't just take somebody's idea, change the name of it and then sell it.</p>
<p>That's the American way, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah. Take a look at Hard Rock Cafe.</p>
<p>Got tweaked by Planet Hollywood.</p>
<p>Coke got tweaked by Pepsi.</p>
<p>Transformers got tweaked by GoBots.</p>
<p>Our job is to step aside and let the consumer decide.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna get a patent for this and sue your balls off.</p>
<p>We're gonna get a patent too, Frank, so screw you.</p>
<p>Kiss it.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Hey, friend!</p>
<p>Hey, we got you a little something to take your mind off your current wife situation.</p>
<p>Sandy, have a seat right here.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>This is Sandy. - Yep, and everything's been taken care of financially.</p>
<p>She's been briefed on the divorce.</p>
<p>She knows all about everything that's going on.</p>
<p>She knows all about it.</p>
<p>And, you know, because you've been talking about the whole money thing a little bit...</p>
<p>You said that we hadn't paid you, and we felt bad about that, so we're kinda hoping that this is sort of a compensation of sorts.</p>
<p>Sandy does that.</p>
<p>Sandy.</p>
<p>She's the payment. - Lawyer, check out this freakish whore we found.</p>
<p>Hey. Whoa. What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>I came to see the lawyer to sue you for breach of contract.</p>
<p>What's with the busty chick?</p>
<p>We're gonna throw a patent on her and a couple of other things.</p>
<p>Now, I see that you have a- a lovely busty woman as well.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>We brought one.</p>
<p>Well, she's a lady of the night.</p>
<p>She's a prostitute.</p>
<p>Don't get too excited. And she's his lady, because he's going through a messy divorce.</p>
<p>We paid her.</p>
<p>So we're gonna have them have... some sexual relations as sort of a payment.</p>
<p>Ah. Wow. Divorce, huh?</p>
<p>That's never fun.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. No, it's terrible.</p>
<p>He's all broken up about it.</p>
<p>She left him- probably 'cause he cheated on her, I'm guessing, 'cause look what a cold bitch she is.</p>
<p>She was mean to him.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: It's a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: He's been crying.</p>
<p>I tell you what, buddy.</p>
<p>I can help you out.</p>
<p>I'm gonna toss a frame bang your way.</p>
<p>Now here's how that works. I slip into your house one night while your wife is sleeping, and I ease into her real nice.</p>
<p>That way, you're both cheating on each other, and she can't clean you out.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: That's a win-win.</p>
<p>Goddamn shoes.</p>
<p>You can't run in 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Ah, son of a bitch. - Come on in.</p>
<p>What- What's with the broads?</p>
<p>You're stealing that idea too?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, we're not stealing...</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>We're tweaking your idea.</p>
<p>You're stealing that idea.</p>
<p>Guys-</p>
<p>You're stealing my idea!</p>
<p>Can you take your ladies outside?</p>
<p>Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>Everyone stop!</p>
<p>I will take care of all of your legal needs... if each of you agrees to never seek my legal advice again.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>For free?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>And, you, promise not to break into my home... and rape my wife while she's sleeping.</p>
<p>Bro, rape? I wasn't talking about raping your wife.</p>
<p>I was talking about making love to her sweetly while she sleeps.</p>
<p>And I was gonna do it for you, you son of a b- All right, fine. I won't do it.</p>
<p>Great. Now we're all here.</p>
<p>Let's get into this.</p>
<p>Deandra.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to sue these guys over some sort of breach of contract thing?</p>
<p>Yes. This one ate a contract that said I got all the rights to the Paddy's Pub merchandise.</p>
<p>That never happened.</p>
<p>It happened!</p>
<p>Okay, why don't you throw out the suit... if they agree to sign a contract that grants you...</p>
<p>50% of the merchandising rights for Paddy's Pub?</p>
<p>Fifty percent?</p>
<p>I'll take it.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p>What the hell you doing, dude?</p>
<p>I'll just eat the contract later.</p>
<p>We would also like to make a patent on Paddy's Shotgun... and this very large-breasted woman who's gonna be shooting the gun into your face.</p>
<p>Objection!</p>
<p>This is not a court of law.</p>
<p>Sustained!</p>
<p>Frank, move to strike.</p>
<p>They stole my idea!</p>
<p>Open your mouth!</p>

<p>Christ's sakes, dude!</p>
<p>[All] Oh!</p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Whoa, man!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>How did you get that much propulsion on the gun?</p>
<p>I made tequila bullets, but I guess I put too much gunpowder in.</p>
<p>New deal! We are taking that propulsion and putting it in our shotgun!</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That deal sucks.</p>
<p>Okay. Why don't you just use both guns?</p>
<p>That's an even better idea.</p>
<p>Two guns!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Six boobs!</p>
<p>We're all on the same team!</p>
<p>Okay. I like that idea.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And, you, you want a right to the cat gloves?</p>
<p>Mittens, dude.</p>
<p>Pay attention.</p>
<p>So sorry, sir.</p>
<p>They duct-taped me to the bathroom sink.</p>
<p>How in the hell did she get out of that?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Next up, we have submission 35... a potential investment opportunity in merchandising... for a, uh- a Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p>You're really sweaty, man.</p>
<p>Well, my eyes are really burning here, Charlie.</p>
<p>Start again. Start-</p>
<p>[Exhales]</p>
<p>Yeah, that's good.</p>
<p>Action, Frank.</p>

<p>Guess who just found some investors for Kitten Mittens!</p>
<p>I told you!</p>
<p>People love stupid shit!</p>
<p>Why do you keep calling it stupid though?</p>
<p>It's really pretty stupid.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>[Dee Shrieks]</p>
<p>Hey, there he is! What's up, man?</p>
<p>Hey, nice tie.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Congratulations on the sale.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Oh, you were there?</p>
<p>Yeah. How much money am I gonna make?</p>
<p>Do what now?</p>
<p>Oh. The contract that you all blindly signed... grants me 100% of the profits... from any merchandising opportunities from your little bar.</p>
<p>And Kitten Mittens-</p>
<p>I own that.</p>
<p>Dude! I had to get paid by you people somehow.</p>
<p>Well, that's what the hooker was for!</p>
<p>Dude!</p>
<p>All right. Touché.</p>
<p>You out-lawyered me there.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell you what though.</p>
<p>Let's split Kitten Mittens 50-50, and then you'll never see me again.</p>
<p>Wow. Fifty-fifty?</p>
<p>Mmm, let me think about that.</p>
<p>How about if I never see you again because the contract... that you all signed also included a restraining order?</p>
<p>[Laughs] Which you're all currently violating.</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me, sir. Can I see these supposed documents that you have?</p>
<p>Why, yes.</p>
<p>Um, in fact, I happen to have that right here.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p>It's still new enough to be edible.</p>
<p>That's an edible contract!</p>
<p>Right in your face!</p>
<p>Really? Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, fortunately, I made hundreds of copies of that.</p>
<p>[Laughs] Goddamn.</p>
<p>So, uh, why don't you all have just a nice day.</p>
