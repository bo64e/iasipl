<p>I like what I'm seeing here!</p>
<p>I like what you're doing right now!</p>
<p>I like what you're doing!</p>
<p>I like what you're doing!</p>
<p>I like what we're all doing!</p>
<p>I like this guy!</p>
<p>This is insane!</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>This is good! This is a good scene!</p>
<p>I've never seen so many beautiful people in my life!</p>
<p>Hey, check it out!</p>
<p>Even Sweet Dee's getting lucky!</p>
<p>That dude's gonna bang your sister, bro.</p>
<p>This is good, man. I feel good.</p>
<p>You look good, brother.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I feel better than good.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like, um... I feel like dancing.</p>
<p>Whoa, it feels good, man!</p>
<p>You should.</p>
<p>I feel like dancing!</p>
<p>Get out there, buddy. Make it happen. Nice.</p>
<p>I feel like dancing!</p>
<p><em>I love that little man.</em></p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I mean, what's going on?</p>
<p>This is, like, the greatest night Paddy's has ever seen.</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p><em>Kind of a young crowd, right?</p>
<p>Yeah!</em></p>
<p>Really, really young.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><em>What, do you think these kids are in college or what?</em></p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey. You. How old are you?</p>
<p>Twenty-one?</p>
<p>Everybody, out!</p>
<p>But I don't understand how you guys could let this happen.</p>
<p>It was not my fault.</p>
<p>I was working behind the bar.</p>
<p>Come on, Dennis. You remember what it was like in high school.</p>
<p>The minute we caught word that a bar wasn't carding... we would just pack the place the following weekend.</p>
<p>They probably had a recon crew come in last week.</p>
<p>They definitely had...</p>
<p>Why, you guys? Why were we not carding?</p>
<p>Not my job.</p>
<p>Not my job either.</p>
<p>It's all of our jobs. We could get into a lot of trouble for this.</p>
<p>And we also have a social responsibility to keep teenagers from drinking.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>I don't know about that though.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac!</p>
<p>Mac, don't.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Hear me out.</p>
<p>It wasn't that long ago that we were in the same position as these youngsters, right?</p>
<p><em>I mean, we'd get kicked out of some bar, and what did we do, Den?</em></p>
<p>We would get a bunch of 40s from a homeless guy... and we'd go sit in some park, right?</p>
<p>That is true. That is absolutely true.</p>
<p>And what would happen?</p>
<p>We would almost get raped and/or murdered and/or stabbed by crackheads in Fairmount Park.</p>
<p>You wanna know what else what would happen?</p>
<p>We drove Nicky Potnik's car into a tree on Kelly Drive.</p>
<p>With Sweet Dee in the backseat puking because some guy talked to her that she liked, remember?</p>
<p>Every time some guy talks to you that you like... you get so nervous you drink yourself into oblivion.</p>
<p>I had bad potato salad.</p>
<p>You drink yourself crazy.</p>
<p>You abused alcohol, and that's okay.</p>
<p>But it's very dangerous, right?</p>
<p>Right? Okay.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we should look at this whole thing from a different angle.</p>
<p>Maybe we have "a social responsibility" to provide a safe haven... for these kids to be kids.</p>
<p>You know, experiment.</p>
<p>No. I don't like where this is heading.</p>
<p>We would have to set up ground rules.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No drinking and driving.</p>
<p>No one's gonna crash Nicky Potnik's car.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Everyone has to take a cab.</p>
<p>Four drink maximum. Like, that's it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. That's it.</p>
<p>Anyone causing trouble can't come.</p>
<p>If you're gonna be here, you gotta be cool.</p>
<p>He's gone! He's gone!</p>
<p>Listen, we water down the drinks, jack up the prices.</p>
<p>Oh, my... Come on!</p>
<p>We could make a serious profit off these kids.</p>
<p>And they'd have no idea what the hell's going on.</p>
<p>We would actually be doing something good.</p>
<p>Great. I say we do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't know how you guys live with yourselves.</p>
<p>One day at a time.</p>
<p>One day at a time.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I know, Mom.</p>
<p>I heard you the first time.</em></p>
<p>I'm perfectly aware of what time it is.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mom.</p>
<p>Do we have to do this right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know how old I am. Did you think that I forgot, maybe, how old... That's...</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I have a date this afternoon with my friend Steven.</p>
<p>So I should probably go, 'cause I gotta get ready for that.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right. Yeah, you too. Bye.</p>
<p>Hello, Steven.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is Trey from last night.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Trey.</p>
<p>You know what? I don't think I should be talking with you.</p>
<p>I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my entire life.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I can't believe that someone as gorgeous as you can be so down to earth.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I've always tried to keep both feet on the ground, so...</p>
<p>Yeah. So, listen, I have a lacrosse game... but I was wondering if you wanted to meet me and my friends at Lemon Hill afterwards.</p>
<p>Lemon Hill?</p>
<p>That's where all the cool kids used to go.</p>
<p>Good. So you've been there.</p>
<p>Oh! Come on.</p>
<p>I've been there, like, 200 times.</p>
<p>Why don't you stop by? I mean, unless you got something better to do today.</p>
<p>Wow. You can really put 'em back, can't you?</p>
<p>The trick is to just kind of open your throat.</p>
<p>You are so much cooler than all the other girls I know.</p>
<p>You are so sweet.</p>
<p>Can you get me another one of these?</p>
<p><em>Whoo!</p>
<p>All right. There you go.</p>
<p>Look how much fun they're having, man.</em></p>
<p>Of course they are. They haven't realized how much life sucks yet.</p>
<p>Remember how great high school was?</p>
<p>All those parties, no responsibilities.</p>
<p>High school was the best.</p>
<p>Do you guys even remember high school?</p>
<p>I don't think it happened the way you think.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>The only reason you got to hang out with me and the other cool kids... is 'cause you sold us all weed.</p>
<p>Everybody thought you were an asshole.</p>
<p>I was popular!</p>
<p>Mac was very popular. And I like to think I was pretty popular myself.</p>
<p><em>You were.</p>
<p>No, he was. You were popular like a clown is popular.</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, you made us all laugh.</p>
<p>All the guys knew you couldn't sleep with their girlfriends.</p>
<p>Whatever, dude. The only reason you got laid is 'cause you dated freshmen.</p>
<p>Yeah. You've always had that creepy thing with younger girls.</p>
<p>I do not.</p>
<p>You're not in high school anymore, pal.</p>
<p>You better keep it in the pants, 'cause it's kind of creepy.</p>
<p>You want to talk about creepy?</p>
<p>You guys sniffing glue in your mom's basement. That's creepy.</p>
<p>Tim Murphy slept with your prom date.</p>
<p><em>Tim Murphy slept with your prom date!</em></p>
<p>Tim Murphy had sex with your prom date!</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p><em>Oh. He's getting sad now.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</em></p>
<p>There's, like, watering in the eyes.</p>
<p>Now he's running away.</p>
<p><em>Oh, is he gonna cry?</em></p>
<p>Did you see that? He was totally gonna cry.</p>
<p>Oh, Trey, that is so sad.</p>
<p>It was a really bad breakup.</p>
<p>I mean, Tammy's great and all.</p>
<p>I just wasn't feeling it, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta feel it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.</p>
<p>Tammy's, like, the prettiest girl in school... so it was a perfect match.</p>
<p>It just wasn't working.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>She's not as pretty as you though.</p>
<p>Oh! Thank you.</p>
<p>Wait! I can't do this.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I never statutory raped anyone before.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Let's, uh, just take it slow.</p>
<p>You are so sweet.</p>
<p>Where were you when I was in high school?</p>
<p>I was eight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These kids are wasted, bro.</p>
<p>I thought we were cuttin' 'em off.</p>
<p>I am cuttin' 'em off. These kids haven't had more than three drinks each.</p>
<p>Plus, there's so much water, they're probably more hydrated than they ever have been.</p>
<p>Are they fakin' it?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p><em>Just stay away from me, Billy!</p>
<p>No, Sara! I saw you flirting with him!</p>
<p>No, I know it.</p>
<p>You were throwing yourself on him!</em></p>
<p>Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Give me some eyes!</p>
<p>Look at me! Cool your jets!</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>All right, beat it!</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>He's such a player.</p>
<p>Is he a player?</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>I hate players. All right. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm getting fired up here.</p>
<p>Charlie, that was the coolest thing you've ever done!</p>
<p>I know. I'm gonna be sick.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>You Dennis Reynolds?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You like what you see?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Dude, relax. I'm 18.</p>
<p>Are you in high school?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then take a hike.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem to bother your sister.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She was all over this one boy in my class today.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Listen, dude, I'm legal... and I love to party.</p>
<p>So if you're looking for the ride of your life... give me a call.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p><em>Hang on. I'm coming!</em></p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I know you were hanging out with that high school kid from the bar.</p>
<p>Okay. You know what?</p>
<p>We're just friends, all right?</p>
<p>He went through a really bad breakup, and he just needed me to be there for him.</p>
<p>What you're doing is sick and wrong.</p>
<p>Are you living out some sad fantasy of yours?</p>
<p>Going out with the most popular kid in high school.</p>
<p>Why would that be a fantasy?</p>
<p>I went out with tons of guys in high school.</p>
<p>You wore that scoliosis back brace until you were 20 years old.</p>
<p>Everyone was afraid of you.</p>
<p>No, they weren't.</p>
<p>You looked like a monster! Do you all have amnesia?</p>
<p>What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You're as delusional as Mac and Charlie.</p>
<p>Do not compare me to Mac and Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, this is the wrong kind of glue, Charlie.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>This is made for, like, kindergartners or something.</p>
<p>No, this will work.</p>
<p>No, look. "Nontoxic and safe."</p>
<p>We don't want safe. We want toxic.</p>
<p>Something's happening.</p>
<p>Nothing is gonna happen.</p>
<p>Something's happening.</p>
<p>Nothing's gonna happen.</p>
<p>No, you're right. This isn't working.</p>
<p>Y'ello. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, hey. How are you?</p>
<p>Really? That's cool.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Dude. That was that girl Sara, the one from the bar the other night... who I rescued from that kid.</p>
<p>Well, her parents are out of town, and she's totally having a party.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Kind of a lame party, bro.</p>
<p>Uh, what do you think?</p>
<p>Should we jet?</p>
<p>Yeah. This doesn't feel right.</p>
<p><em>Hey, guys!</em></p>
<p>Hi, Sara.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I'm so glad you guys came.</p>
<p>Well, uh, we ran into a little bit of a problem.</p>
<p>My brother, he was supposed to pick up the keg, but he bailed on me.</p>
<p>Oh, that sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, it totally sucks.</p>
<p>So, um, we were wondering if maybe you guys could help us out.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean... No, I don't...</p>
<p>Ooh, no.</p>
<p>Geez, I don't think that's such a good idea.</p>
<p>Listen, it's one thing at the bar, you know, where we have control over you guys.</p>
<p>It's another thing...</p>
<p>Ah, come on, please? Please.</p>
<p>You guys have been so cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were just talking about how cool you guys were.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You were?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. This would be the coolest thing that anyone's ever done for us.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Who wants to do a keg stand?</p>
<p><em>Um, I'm kind ofhaving second thoughts a little bit.</em></p>
<p>Oh, come on. It'll be a blast.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I don't think your friends like me that much.</p>
<p><em>Let's go get a beer.</em></p>
<p>Twenty-five, 26...</p>
<p>27, 28, 29!</p>
<p>Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Just hanging out, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wanna do a keg stand?</p>
<p>Seventy-five, 76, 77!</p>
<p>Seventy-seven seconds! That is a new record, baby! - I did it. I did it.</p>
<p>So, Ben is, like, "I don't care what Kevin said, Sara.</p>
<p>I was only going out with Rachel to get closer to you."</p>
<p>Oh, my... Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What did you say to that?</p>
<p>"Whatever, Ben. I heard from Caitlin that you were totally into her."</p>
<p>Um, he's so full of shit.</p>
<p><em>Goddamn!</em></p>
<p>Come on. Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Yeah! What do you think about that, bitches?</p>
<p><em>Load 'em up, losers!</p>
<p>What do you think about this, huh?</em></p>
<p>How I embarrassed your boyfriend in front of everybody? You like that?</p>
<p>You like what you see?</p>
<p>What's with this guy?</p>
<p>I know. What is he, like, 40?</p>
<p>Get me some more! Get me some more!</p>
<p>Let's go! Load 'em up!</p>
<p>I'm gonna put on a goddamn clinic!</p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>Come on, guys. Hey.</p>
<p>Let's go. Let's go!</p>
<p>Oh, get off me, dude!</p>
<p>Get off me!</p>
<p>Can we please get out of here?</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Trey asked me to prom last night.</p>
<p>This is getting really weird.</p>
<p>That girl Sara asked me too.</p>
<p>You're kidding!</p>
<p>What? No, we can't go to the prom.</p>
<p>That's pathetic.</p>
<p>What do you mean "we"?</p>
<p>Who asked you?</p>
<p>Let's just go. Let's just go.</p>
<p>All right, all right. I'm coming.</p>
<p>Hi, sexy.</p>
<p>What are you doing here? You gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>I need a date for the prom, and I want you to take me.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I can't do that, okay?</p>
<p>You gotta go.</p>
<p>Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind?</p>
<p>No. No, no, no. No.</p>
<p>Leave. Leave. Go.</p>
<p>Okay. You can either take me to the prom... or I can tell the police that you're serving underage kids.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Try me.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>You know what? I don't think we should be serving minors anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Somebody's jealous.</p>
<p>I'm not jealous. I just think it's dangerous.</p>
<p><em>You're jealous you didn't get asked to the prom.</p>
<p>I don't care about that.</em></p>
<p>Ah, you're gonna cry?</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Yo, you guys?</p>
<p>No more kids in the bar, seriously.</p>
<p>Okay! Now we're talking some sense.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>This girl asked me to the prom.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. This girl comes over to my house... tells me that if I don't go to the prom with her, she's gonna rat us out to the cops.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Hold on.</p>
<p>So all of you guys got asked to the prom?</p>
<p>You guys got asked to the prom?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh, this is so lame!</p>
<p>At least you don't actually have to go.</p>
<p>Are you going?</p>
<p>Yeah. I have to.</p>
<p>Oh, well, if you're going, I'm going then, I guess.</p>
<p>So you...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I didn't get to go when I was in high school.</p>
<p>It might actually be fun.</p>
<p><em>If you guys are going, I'm going.</p>
<p>I'm not staying here.</em></p>
<p>Are you gonna go?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>I have to go, so...</p>
<p>You guys are pathetic!</p>
<p>Maybe if you weren't such a jerk, someone might have asked you.</p>
<p>Because Sara told me that Maureen told her that Regina McGinley thought you were cute.</p>
<p>Then Ray Rafferty comes up to you at the party, and you're...</p>
<p>Charlie, shut up!</p>
<p>The only reason that Sara asked you in the first place is because you're the only idiot... dumb enough to listen to her bitch about her ex-boyfriend all night!</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Hey, we should have a pre-prom party.</p>
<p>You know what, Charlie?</p>
<p>I think this is actually gonna be pretty great.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, are you kidding me?</p>
<p>This is gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>I can't wait to just get out there and start dancing.</p>
<p>I'm gonna dance too.</p>
<p>Are you gonna dance, baby? You gonna dance with me?</p>
<p>I'm gonna dance like this.</p>
<p>Oh, Dee! Come here.</p>
<p>Let me take a look at you.</p>
<p>Wow. You look... You look... Yeah.</p>
<p>I know. I feel so lucky that this thing even fits still.</p>
<p>Is that your dress from high school?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>You didn't go to the prom in high school, Dee.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>My back brace was under the dress, and Mom called me fat.</p>
<p>So I stayed home and cried instead.</p>
<p>Take... Take it slow. Take it slow.</p>
<p><em>I know, you guys, but I just am so nervous.</em></p>
<p>I just want this whole night to be so special.</p>
<p>That dude is going to bang your sister, bro.</p>
<p>What's up, bitches? Mmm!</p>
<p>What is this? What are you doing?</p>
<p>You assholes aren't gonna be the only ones having fun. I'm going to the prom.</p>
<p>Dork! You cannot crash a high school prom.</p>
<p>I'm going stag, bro.</p>
<p>Mac, you are so pathetic.</p>
<p>Yes, and your eyebrows are drawn on, so...</p>
<p>Whoa. Well, you know what?</p>
<p>How 'bout this?</p>
<p>Say it, don't spray it.</p>
<p><em>Trey's here. Oh, my God.</em></p>
<p>Hello. Excuse me, Mac.</p>
<p>My date has arrived.</p>
<p>Trey is so cool.</p>
<p>He's totally gonna bang your sister.</p>
<p>Hello, sweet prince.</p>
<p>Wow! You look... good.</p>
<p>I know! Like a princess.</p>
<p>Can I tell you a little secret?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Beat it.</p>
<p>I always wanted to have sex on prom.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>All right. So what's the plan?</p>
<p>Do we have a limo or what?</p>
<p>The plan is, you're not coming with us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>You weren't invited and you don't have a date.</p>
<p>You totally suck.</p>
<p>I totally suck?</p>
<p>What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>Oh, who is that?</p>
<p>That's my prom date.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>She's unbelievable.</p>
<p>How old is she?</p>
<p>She's 18.</p>
<p>Eighteen?</p>
<p>You are a lucky man. You are a lucky man.</p>
<p>Oh, you dick!</p>
<p>Wait a second. You guys called me creepy for liking young chicks.</p>
<p>Eighteen's legal, bro.</p>
<p>This isn't a morality contest.</p>
<p>Eighteen's not young, brother.</p>
<p>So you guys are giving me the go-ahead? I mean, can I... - Go ahead.</p>
<p>Hi, Dennis.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You look...</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Do ya?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I can't zip it up. Your hair's all caught.</p>
<p>All right. Just pull it.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Tammy?</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. No. What?</p>
<p>Hold on one minute.</p>
<p>Can I get you a drink?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>What would you like?</p>
<p>Anything you want.</p>
<p>Tammy, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm picking up my date.</p>
<p>You're going to prom with this guy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>This is classic Tammy.</p>
<p>Trey broke up with Tammy because Maureen Kinallen said... that she saw Tammy flirting with Walt Timby at a party.</p>
<p>But she was only doing it to make Trey jealous because, you know... she thought that Trey secretly liked Erin Hannabry.</p>
<p>But Trey didn't like Erin Hannabry.</p>
<p>It was all a bunch of bull.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>That's Tammy, Trey's ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>This is classic Tammy.</p>
<p>Trey broke up with Tammy...</p>
<p>Charlie, you gotta stop, honestly.</p>
<p><em>What are they talking about?</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Where are they going?</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</em></p>
<p>Oh, man! Ah, they did it.</p>
<p>They got what they wanted.</p>
<p>This is bullshit.</p>
<p>So wait a second.</p>
<p>They were actually using you two... to make each other jealous.</p>
<p>I always knew that they'd wind up together, 'cause they're, like, so perfect for each other.</p>
<p>Shut up, Charlie!</p>
<p>They're one of those perfect matches.</p>
<p>That dude's gonna bang your prom date, bro.</p>
<p>Stop saying it!</p>
