<p><em>You're being ridiculous.</p>
<p>He's a professional football player.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about killing the guy.</p>
<p>I'm talking about going with a group...</em> and intimidate him, maybe break his arm.</p>
<p>You can't break Tom Brady's arm.</p>
<p>Yes, I can.</p>
<p>No more Super Bowls for that pretty boy.</p>
<p>Listen. Let me tell you something with absolute honesty and concern for your well-being.</p>
<p>Tom Brady would kick your ass.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Come on, who locked up last night?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>The kid needs to start paying attention.</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>I don't know. I've never seen him before.</p>
<p>Well, can you get him out of here? He stinks.</p>
<p>Hey, let's go. Oh, my... Je...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. He shit his pants, Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't wanna know that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna poke him with this.</p>
<p><em>Get up, old man. This isn't the American Legion. Wake up!</em></p>
<p>Yo!</p>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
<p>He won't wake up.</p>
<p>Well, poke him harder in his ribs.</p>
<p><em>Wake up, old man.</p>
<p>Wake up!</em></p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>That bitch is dead.</p>
<p>This ought to do wonders for business.</p>
<p>How could you let this happen, Charlie?</p>
<p>What? It's not my fault.</p>
<p>The guy orders one drink... sits down, I don't see him again the rest of the night.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do about this booth?</p>
<p>There's piss and shit everywhere.</p>
<p>All the death germs.</p>
<p>Plus, that guy was so old.</p>
<p>Old people are gross.</p>
<p>Tell you what. I'll get the gasoline.</p>
<p>We're not gonna burn it.</p>
<p>Come on, dude. You never let me burn anything.</p>
<p>Maybe we should close to fumigate or something.</p>
<p>No, no. We can't do that.</p>
<p>We can't let anybody know that this happened. We'll never live it down.</p>
<p>Are we gonna serve drinks today? I don't think the board of health will be too keen on that.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Do you see any representatives from the board of health here?</p>
<p>Let's clean up the mess and act like it never happened.</p>
<p>I'm not getting anywhere near that booth.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys are making me do this.</p>
<p>I can't believe you left a dead guy in the bar overnight. So I guess we're even.</p>
<p>Charlie, the E. M. T. Said he had a heart attack, not Ebola.</p>
<p>Do you wanna do this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Then don't question my methods.</p>
<p><em>Whoa, Charlie! Stop!</p>
<p>Stop, stop, stop, stop. Goddamn it.</em></p>
<p>We need to isolate the area.</p>
<p>You're just gonna spread whatever parts of him decomposed overnight.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What, are you a scientist, dude?</p>
<p>A scientist?</p>
<p>That's, like, science talk.</p>
<p><em>Science talk?</p>
<p>What the hell is science talk?</em></p>
<p>I'm sorry. We're closed.</p>
<p>No, we're not.</p>
<p>Hey. How you doing?</p>
<p>I'm looking for the owner.</p>
<p>That's me. Actually...</p>
<p><em>Actually, I'm the owner.</p>
<p>I could help her out now.</em></p>
<p>We own it together.</p>
<p>Not really. What can I help you with?</p>
<p>My name is Rebecca Keane. I was notified that my grandfather died here last night.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>That's really horrible.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p><em>I, uh... I just wanted to see where he spent his last night.</p>
<p>Hmm, that would be somewhere in this vicinity over here.</em></p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Are you all right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm okay. L... I really didn't know him that well actually.</p>
<p>But he didn't have any other family, so the police called me.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so sad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I was a little curious, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, he's my grandfather.</p>
<p>And I know nothing about him.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, he was a great man.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, just a very warm and... gentle soul actually.</p>
<p>So you knew him?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn't actually say that I knew him all that well.</p>
<p>I knew him pretty well.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got pretty close near the end there.</p>
<p><em>Wow, really?</p>
<p>I knew him too.</em></p>
<p>L- I just meant...</p>
<p>I thought you meant more of a...</p>
<p><em>He didn't know him as well as I did though.</p>
<p>Oh.</em></p>
<p>Well, listen, I should go. I have to get back to work. I just wanted to stop in.</p>
<p>Of course. Well, listen, if you ever wanna stop by, you know...</p>
<p>I could tell you some stories about your grandfather that you would not believe.</p>
<p>L- I'll make myself available as well.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, any time.</p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Bye.</em></p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're totally blowing up my spot.</p>
<p>I'm not blowing up your spot.</p>
<p>You can't just claim the girl for yourself.</p>
<p>She's way out of your league anyway.</p>
<p>Out of my league? She's out of your league. I could get that chick.</p>
<p>Hey, guys! A man died here yesterday.</p>
<p>His family just abandoned him.</p>
<p>Could we think about that for one second?</p>
<p>Why the hell would we want to think about that?</p>
<p>Really depressing, Dee.</p>
<p>It just makes me think about Pop-Pop is all.</p>
<p>Pop-Pop is an asshole, Sweet Dee.</p>
<p>And I'm placing my bets that that girl's grandfather is an asshole too.</p>
<p>People don't just abandon their parents for no good reason.</p>
<p><em>Dude, have you ever been to a nursing home?</em></p>
<p>People abandon their parents all the time.</p>
<p>It's a sad, throwaway culture we live in.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie. Can I come in?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Whoa. Geez, your place is looking... good.</p>
<p>Yeah. I've been doing some rearra... rearranging.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So you wanna have a seat?</p>
<p>Uh, no, I don't. Charlie, your, uh...</p>
<p>Have a seat, come on.</p>
<p>Listen, I wanted to ask you a favor.</p>
<p>Will you go to the nursing home with me to see my grandfather? Dennis won't go.</p>
<p>Dennis won't go?</p>
<p>No, he won't go.</p>
<p>What a jerk.</p>
<p>I know, and I haven't seen him since I was really little.</p>
<p>And he's stuck in that nursing home.</p>
<p>And I don't wanna wait until it's too late and then regret it.</p>
<p>Why don't you just go by yourself?</p>
<p>Uh, I have a little bit of a problem with old people.</p>
<p>Sounds a little mean, but I find them kind of creepy and scary and gross.</p>
<p>I think they're gross.</p>
<p>It's their hands mostly.</p>
<p>You know, how you can see right through them.</p>
<p>They're all...</p>
<p>Their inside business is...</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>I'll go with you... but you have to let me borrow your car any time I want.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Every now and then.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>One time.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And... you have to take me to lunch... twice a week for a year.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>Once a week. Today.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I can get hot chicks, dude.</p>
<p>Mac, don't embarrass yourself.</p>
<p>I will always win in these circumstances.</p>
<p><em>You will not, dude.</p>
<p>She's coming over here to see me.</em></p>
<p>She's coming to see you because you answered the phone, dude.</p>
<p>That's just semantics, bro. You know, I have a real shot with this chick.</p>
<p>You can't beat me here, okay? I will always win in these circumstances.</p>
<p>I will one-up you.</p>
<p>I'm sharper than you.</p>
<p>You're not sharper. Shut up. Shut up.</p>
<p>You shut up.</p>
<p>Don't tell me to shut up.</p>
<p>Hi, guys.</p>
<p>Is this a bad time?</p>
<p>No, this is a great time.</p>
<p>We were just... We...</p>
<p>We were talking about your grandfather.</p>
<p>Emotions are running very high around here today.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's been a difficult couple of days for me.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I try not to think about me though in circumstances like this.</em></p>
<p>More importantly, how are you?</p>
<p><em>You kind oflook like you're gonna pass out.</em></p>
<p>Charlie, I don't think I can do this.</p>
<p>I'm not kidding.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You're gonna be fine.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Look at that one.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</p>
<p>They have ears, all right?</p>
<p>All right, listen to me, Dee.</p>
<p>The slow and painful crawl to death... is an inevitable part of life.</p>
<p>So just embrace it, all right?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>It's really creepy in here.</p>
<p>What is that very bad smell?</p>
<p>Uh, it's probably urine and maybe some feces.</p>
<p>17-D, right? This is your Pop-Pop's door.</p>
<p>Just hold on a second.</p>
<p>What if he asks us to help him go to the bathroom?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Come on. A lot of people lead perfectly normal lives in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus! He doesn't even look like a real person.</p>
<p>Should we go wake him up?</p>
<p>No! I don't know. Let's go.</p>
<p>No, we can't go. We came all the way down here. Let's just...</p>
<p>I need some air.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, no, no, Dee. Do not leave me here alone. 'Cause I can't...</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh, this is awkward. I'm... I'm not...</p>
<p>Dennis, come here.</p>
<p><em>L- I've been waiting...</em> a long time for this moment, Dennis.</p>
<p>Okay. You have?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. My only grandson finally come to see me. Come close.</p>
<p>My eyesight's not so good.</p>
<p>You're lot shorter than I thought you'd wind up.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know.</p>
<p>I'm actually still growin', so...</p>
<p>You want some candy?</p>
<p>No, I'm good. Thanks.</p>
<p>Eat the damn candy!</p>
<p>Okay. Candy.</p>
<p>These people in here... they've stolen everything from me.</p>
<p>They have?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, what do you expect from Jews, right, Dennis?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Jews. Um, maybe I should go and check on Dee, because...</p>
<p>No, leave her be.</p>
<p>I'm sure she'll be fine.</p>
<p>I'm an old man, Dennis.</p>
<p>And as you can see, I don't have much time left.</p>
<p>I need your help.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not very comfortable with that.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't even know which one of these things I would unplug.</p>
<p>No, you idiot!</p>
<p>I don't need you to kill me.</p>
<p>I need you to help me.</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, okay.</p>
<p>You probably don't know this because that bastard father of yours didn't tell you... but I was a war hero.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I wanna be buried in my uniform.</p>
<p>And I don't trust any of these kikes in here...</p>
<p><em>to take care of that.</em></p>
<p>All the belongings from that part of my life are in a box... at the Roxborough Storage Facility.</p>
<p><em>I need you to pick it up and bring it here.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, sure.</p>
<p>I could do that.</em></p>
<p>And I need you to keep it as a secret between you and me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p><em>So listen, I have a favor to ask you guys.</em></p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That's cool.</p>
<p>Anything, yeah.</p>
<p>You can talk to me, 'cause I get things done, so...</p>
<p>I'm in charge of putting together a memorial service for him... but I can't seem to find anyone else who really knew him that well.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That might be difficult to do actually.</p>
<p>It's not gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>I knew a lot of his friends. Good guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, Den. But, uh, it might be hard to find "friends."</p>
<p>It's not gonna be hard for me.</p>
<p>That would be so amazing.</p>
<p>Would you like another drink?</p>
<p>No, we're fine.</p>
<p>I need your car.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie. I wasn't really serious about that.</p>
<p>No. Go get it. You promised.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Where you going?</p>
<p>Going back to see Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>What the hell you talking about?</p>
<p>You're going to see my Pop-Pop without me?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You can't do that. He's my Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>I'm the one who's supposed to feel better about myself. I'm going with you.</p>
<p>Oh, you can't actually, because it's just supposed to be me and him.</p>
<p>I want to see my Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>Take the bus.</p>
<p>Jesus, Dennis.</p>
<p>This is just goddamn shady.</p>
<p>Hey, bud. If you wanna back out now, be my guest.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to take all the credit for this.</p>
<p>I'm not backing down.</p>
<p>All right, all right. Hey, pal.</p>
<p>How would you like to make 20 bucks?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Got some nicer clothes?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Okay, guys. Have fun. Mingle.</p>
<p><em>Hey, guys. - Hey, Rebecca. - Rebecca.</em></p>
<p>I see you brought some of my grandfather's friends.</p>
<p>He loved those guys.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if maybe you guys could say something.</p>
<p>You know, maybe tell a funny story about him or something.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. No, absolutely. Actually, I've got a little something prepared.</p>
<p>If that's okay.</p>
<p>Mac, did you prepare...</p>
<p>Oh, no. Sorry. I totally forgot.</p>
<p>He's a terrible public speaker.</p>
<p><em>He gets really flustered and he clams up and his third-grade stutter comes back.</p>
<p>It's adorable. Oh, is that your phone?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gonna answer that?</p>
<p>Well, I don't wanna be rude.</p>
<p>Well, the ringer's going off in the middle of a funeral.</p>
<p>It's gotta be pretty important, right?</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Charlie, what do you want?</p>
<p>Mac, you gotta come to my apartment right now.</p>
<p>I can't, dude.</p>
<p>I'm in the middle of something.</p>
<p>I don't care what you're doing.</p>
<p>Get over here right now! It's an emergency!</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I gotta go. It's an emergency.</p>
<p>You gotta leave? That's a shame.</p>
<p>So can I borrow your car, or what?</p>
<p>You've been drinking.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>He's a good guy. He's just... got a bit of a drinking problem.</p>
<p><em>Who is it?</p>
<p>It's Mac, dude. This better be good.</em></p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>This is unbelievable!</p>
<p>I know that! There are, like, so many medals in there, dude!</p>
<p>This guy was probably, like, king Nazi.</p>
<p>How is this even possible, Charlie?</p>
<p>Oh, it's possible.</p>
<p>They came on boats or whatever, but they're here.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on.</p>
<p>This could just be collector's crap.</p>
<p>No. No, no, no. No.</p>
<p><em>Look at that!</em></p>
<p>He looks exactly like Dennis.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>All right, so here's the deal.</p>
<p>He wants me to take all this shit to him so he can be, like, buried in it or something.</p>
<p>Buried in it?</p>
<p>Screw that old bitch. He's a Nazi.</p>
<p>Let him die and burn in hell, right?</p>
<p>Let's sell this shit on eBay.</p>
<p>No, I thought about that though.</p>
<p>I think it's, like... illegal, or maybe a little bit immoral.</p>
<p>We could sell it to a museum.</p>
<p>I could live with that.</p>
<p>Lionel Keane.</p>
<p>As we all know, Lionel could be a bit of a curmudgeon.</p>
<p>But he had the heart of a lion.</p>
<p>I'll tell you a story about him.</p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve last year and, uh...</p>
<p>I was at Lionel's house, making him dinner.</p>
<p>And we got to talking about the spirit of giving.</p>
<p>And I said, "Lionel, why are we just talking about it?</p>
<p>Let's put the spirit into action.</p>
<p>Let's go down to the mission."</p>
<p>Lionel said, "Great.</p>
<p>That's a great idea, Dennis."</p>
<p>So we did, we went down there.</p>
<p><em>And not only did we feed...</em> every last poor, miserable, precious soul... but we washed the feet of every man, woman and child there... in the spirit of Christ.</p>
<p><em>And that was Lionel.</em></p>
<p>Lionel Keane.</p>
<p>Lionel the lion.</p>
<p><em>Sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting.</p>
<p>Not a problem at all.</em></p>
<p>How can I help you?</p>
<p>We are going to make your day today, sir.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>We've gotten our hands on a "little something"... that we like to think is an important part of human history... and needs to be in this museum.</p>
<p>Mac, if you will.</p>
<p>What in the hell is that?</p>
<p>This, my friend, is an authentic Nazi officer's uniform circa 1942.</p>
<p>Notice the stitching and fine attention to detail.</p>
<p>Where did you get this?</p>
<p>Let's just say it found its way to us and leave it at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Okay. I find this offensive for so many reasons.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you acquired this through illegal means.</p>
<p>For me to take this from you would be an extension of that.</p>
<p>And secondly, that you would expect it would "make my day"... assumes that I'm interested in profiting off the murder of millions of innocent people.</p>
<p>How much will you give us for it?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing, or...</p>
<p>I plan to call the police the minute you guys leave my office.</p>
<p>Hey, Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>Deandra?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Where's Dennis?</p>
<p>Oh, um, I just came by myself.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, do you know where Dennis is?</p>
<p>He was supposed to be here hours ago.</p>
<p>No, no. Pop-Pop, it's just me.</p>
<p>I thought that... you and I could spend some time together... so I brought a couple books that I could read to you.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Come here and sit down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, why don't you come closer so I can get a good look at you?</p>
<p>Come here, come here.</p>
<p>Okay, that's fine.</p>
<p>Sure, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Good idea.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>A little closer. Come here.</p>
<p>Come on, come on.</p>
<p>Come here, come here.</p>
<p>Oh, now I remember how beautiful you are.</p>
<p>And look at these wrinkled old hands against your young face.</p>
<p>Oh, and... and these teeth.</p>
<p>Look. Look how straight and white.</p>
<p>Is there a bathroom around here?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right down the hall.</p>
<p>We're doing the right thing here, man.</p>
<p>Yeah. But it just seems like a waste of a perfectly good Nazi uniform.</p>
<p>No, no, no. If we sell it, we run the risk of going to jail.</p>
<p>And if we keep it, we don't get anything, so we may as well burn it.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>I mean, it is always fun to burn things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>And we probably shouldn't let Dennis know about his grandfather anyway.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It might just screw with his head.</p>
<p>Yeah, get it going.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><em>Get on.</p>
<p>Get on it.</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersehen.</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersehen, my friend.</em></p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>So it's all in there, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn't keep anything, or...</p>
<p>No. Did you?</p>
<p>No. No, dude.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, bro.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What's up? What you burning?</p>
<p>Some trash.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Do you wanna hear what happened with that girl?</p>
<p>No. No, I don't, dude.</p>
<p>No? Oh, come on.</p>
<p>I don't care about what happened.</p>
<p>Of course you care.</p>
<p>I don't wanna hear it, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do.</p>
<p>Okay. You know what, bro?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. You win. Okay?</p>
<p>I give up. You won.</p>
<p>You're the better man.</p>
<p>You don't give up. See, I won fair and square. We went head-to-head... and I came out the better man, just as I predicted I would.</p>
<p>So we went back to her house... and we made sweet, passionate love.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great for you. You...</p>
<p>You must be really proud of yourself.</p>
<p>Awesome. Your grandfather's a Nazi.</p>
<p>Who's your neighbor?</p>
<p><em>I'm your neighbor.</p>
<p>But let me ask you a couple questions.</p>
<p>Go ahead, shoot.</p>
<p>Ask away.</p>
<p>Who lives in this here hole?</p>
<p>What hole?</p>
<p>That big brown hole.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm inside that hole.</p>
<p>Dozen Rangers in there too.</p>
<p>All right. Well...</em></p>
