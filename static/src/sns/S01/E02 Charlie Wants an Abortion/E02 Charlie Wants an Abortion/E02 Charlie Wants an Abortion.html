<p><em>No, dude.</p>
<p>It's not... It's not a question of individual style.</p>
<p>It's about having some taste.</p>
<p>You're attacking my ability to express myself, dude.</em></p>
<p>How am I attacking your ability to...</p>
<p>I just don't get it.</p>
<p>What's not to get?</p>
<p>"Come to Philly for the crack."</p>
<p>It has a picture of the Liberty Bell on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but...</p>
<p>It's funny and original.</p>
<p>It's not fun... How is it funny and original?</p>
<p>Every asshole on South Street's wearing a T-shirt with an ironic slogan on it.</p>
<p>Well, excuse me if all my T-shirts don't have a little guy playing polo on the lapel.</p>
<p>You cut the sleeves off of all your T-shirts.</p>
<p>What, so you can show off your tats?</p>
<p>Those are really original, dude.</p>
<p>They're tribal.</p>
<p>Oh, they're trib... I'm sorry. What tribe are you from?</p>
<p>What? Is it, like, an Indian tribe or...</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>You guys gonna let me in this game or what?</p>
<p>No. You're the ref.</p>
<p>I don't want to ref anymore. I'd like to play, so...</p>
<p>You're an excellent ref.</p>
<p>You're a very good ref.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I'm a great ref. I'd like to play the game now.</p>
<p>Are you gonna get mad? You gonna turn into the mad munchkin?</p>
<p>What's the ma...</p>
<p>Do you represent the Lollipop Guild, Charlie?</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p><em>Hey, Charlie.</em></p>
<p>That's a mad munchkin dance? Oh, okay. This is what we do?</p>
<p>I need to talk to you.</p>
<p>It's about our son!</p>
<p>Nobody wants to hear that.</p>
<p><em>So, wait, she's sayin'this is your son?</p>
<p>I don't know.</em></p>
<p>Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me, Charlie.</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>I know it. There's, like, no way that this is possible.</p>
<p>Well, did you have sex with her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. Did you use birth control?</p>
<p><em>Oh, Dee, we went to Catholic school, so...</p>
<p>Okay. You're allowed...</em> to have premarital sex, but you're not allowed to use birth control?</p>
<p>No. All right. You're twisting words here and, like, gettin' cute.</p>
<p>When did she have this kid?</p>
<p>It's been, like, 10 years since I've even seen her, so...</p>
<p>Ten years?</p>
<p>What does she want?</p>
<p>Well, that's... that's the weird thing.</p>
<p>She doesn't want money or anything.</p>
<p>She just wants me to meet him.</p>
<p>Are you gonna do it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, dude, you gotta meet the kid.</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta find out for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>It's just...</p>
<p>I mean, I wish I could go back in time and do the right thing, you know?</p>
<p>Like be there for him?</p>
<p>No. Get her an abortion.</p>
<p>So you're not allowed to use birth control, but abortions are no problem?</p>
<p>All right. Okay.</p>
<p>So now you're, like, a word genius.</p>
<p>And everything I say, you twist it around and make me look dumb.</p>
<p>Charlie's right though.</p>
<p>He should have at least had a say in the matter.</p>
<p><em>It's her body, and it's her decision.</p>
<p>No, I'm sorry.</em></p>
<p>It's not just her decision.</p>
<p>The man should get a vote.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, ultimately it's her choice.</p>
<p>It is not just her choice.</p>
<p><em>It's nobody's choice.</p>
<p>It should be left up to God.</em></p>
<p>Is he... Is that...</p>
<p>Are you joking?</p>
<p><em>No, it's not a joke!</p>
<p>You remember Genesis, Book Two, Verse Three?</em></p>
<p>"And he breathed into the nostrils of Adam on the first day. And it was good."</p>
<p>Right in his nostrils, huh?</p>
<p>Sounds really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You're making an asshole out of yourself.</p>
<p>Dude, you need to get a blood test, okay?</p>
<p>I remember Stacy Corvelli. She was a slut.</p>
<p>You're right. You're right.</p>
<p>Uh, Mac, what's God's stance on blood tests?</p>
<p>Hmm. I don't know.</p>
<p>I'd have to check.</p>
<p><em>All right, you feeling good?</em></p>
<p>No. I feel nauseous.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna go. I'm gonna run.</p>
<p>No, no, no. It's...</p>
<p>I should go.</p>
<p>Hi. Hey, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>You brought your, uh...</p>
<p>Uh, Dennis Reynolds. We didn't get a chance to talk before, but I remember you. Yeah.</p>
<p>You went to St. Giles?</p>
<p>I did. Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>With... Yeah.</p>
<p>So you two are together now, or...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>No. I'm just here for moral support.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're not...</p>
<p>That's not even a...</p>
<p>I brought him along.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So...</p>
<p>All right. Come on in.</p>
<p>I'm real glad you decided to do this, Charlie.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Well, uh, you know, it's the least I could do, so...</p>
<p>Yeah. Sorry I don't have a lot of time.</p>
<p>I gotta get to work.</p>
<p>Uh, Tommy, come on in here, Son!</p>
<p><em>What do you want, Mom?</em></p>
<p>He's a bit of a handful.</p>
<p>Uh, Charlie and his friend are here.</p>
<p><em>So goddamn what?</em></p>
<p>Tommy, come in here, please!</p>
<p>This is bullshit.</p>
<p><em>Whoa!</p>
<p>Language, please.</em></p>
<p>Which one of you fags is supposed to be my dad?</p>
<p>Whoa, hello.</p>
<p>Right off the bat with the...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tommy, be nice. Huh?</p>
<p>This is Charlie.</p>
<p>Are you serious? This is the guy?</p>
<p>What's that...</p>
<p>What's that supposed to mean, buddy?</p>
<p>Okay. Well, I should be home around 8:00.</p>
<p>Uh, what do you guys have planned?</p>
<p>Uh, I thought we'd go to the park.</p>
<p>Huh. That sounds nice.</p>
<p>Wanna go to the park, Tommy?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Okay. That's great. Bye, sweetie.</p>
<p><em>Have fun, boys.</em></p>
<p>I'm not goin' to the park.</p>
<p>No shit.</p>
<p>What is this place?</p>
<p>Uh, this is a place where we're gonna go see a special friend of mine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>'Cause he's gonna help us figure something very important out.</p>
<p>It's gonna be good to know.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I said so. No more questions, okay, buddy?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Stop saying "why."</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Stop it. I don't like this game.</p>
<p>Why? Why?</p>
<p>Is this a game? This is your game?</p>
<p>Why? Why?</p>
<p>Hey, pretty boy.</p>
<p>What you here for?</p>
<p>My friend's gettin' a... blood test.</p>
<p>Your boyfriend?</p>
<p>No. He's not my...</p>
<p>He's not my boyfriend.</p>
<p>He got Al DS?</p>
<p>I don't...</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>I'll blow you for $10.</p>
<p>You know what? Let me consult some of this free literature... they got here regarding that proposition.</p>
<p>Oh. You know what?</p>
<p>According to this, that's not really a good idea. So I'm gonna have to pass.</p>
<p>But thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Really nice of you.</p>
<p>He's playin' mind games, dude.</p>
<p>I wanna leave.</p>
<p>Hey, it's tough.</p>
<p>What are we doin' here?</p>
<p>Don't answer that. It's a trick question.</p>
<p>He tries to get in your head.</p>
<p><em>It's a little game he plays.</p>
<p>No, let... let me answer the question.</em></p>
<p>See, we're at a free clinic, Tommy. Charlie doesn't have health insurance.</p>
<p>See this lady back here? Take a look.</p>
<p>That's what you get when you don't have health insurance.</p>
<p>I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p>Keep your voice down.</p>
<p>I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p>Keep your voice...</p>
<p>I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p>Stop yelling...</p>
<p>I wanna go to the...</p>
<p>Stop your yelling. We need to... Ow!</p>
<p>He's biting my hand! He's biting my hand!</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p><em>Let's go. Let's go.</em></p>
<p>Sacred Right. It's a child, not a choice.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All righty. I'll make sure he gets the message. Thank you.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>So I was having an argument with some friends the other day. - Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And I was wondering if you could help me out with some information.</p>
<p>Are you interested in joining our cause?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No. Actually, just looking for some info on the Bible, Jesus, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well, if you join our mailing list, the reverend...</p>
<p>Okay, listen to me.</p>
<p>I don't really wanna join your little freak show.</p>
<p>Just looking for some information.</p>
<p>So if you could point me in the right direction, that'd be great.</p>
<p>Well, we have some literature...</p>
<p>Great. Thank you. Thanks.</p>
<p>On the display back by the water cooler.</p>
<p>Oh, mama.</p>
<p>Hey, there.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><em>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, are you here to sign up for the rally?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Yeah, real excited about the rally.</p>
<p>We're gonna kick ass this time.</p>
<p>Well, I'm ready to kick somebody's ass, I'll tell you what. I hate those bastards.</p>
<p>Wow! That's...</p>
<p>Uh, hate's a very strong word.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let me tell you something, Megan.</p>
<p>I hate dead baby fetuses, you know?</p>
<p>I hate them because they're dead, and they shouldn't be.</p>
<p>They should be alive, and they should be loved.</p>
<p>Oh! Wow!</p>
<p>You just... You seem really passionate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>More than you know.</p>
<p>Nice kid, Charlie.</p>
<p>What the hell do you think is wrong with that kid?</p>
<p><em>You've gotta get that blood test, dude.</em></p>
<p>Die! Die! Die!</p>
<p>No! Hey! Whoa, Tommy! No!</p>
<p>No! No! No! Give me the stick!</p>
<p>Give me the stick!</p>
<p>Come on! This place sucks!</p>
<p>I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p>We can't go to the mall, all right?</p>
<p>Shut up! I'm the boss of you!</p>
<p>You're not the boss of me!</p>
<p>I am the boss! I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p><em>I'll show you who's the boss of who.</p>
<p>Let's go to the mall!</em></p>
<p>You wanna go to the mall?</p>
<p>I wanna go to the mall!</p>
<p>You could ask nice. Dennis, let's go.</p>
<p>We're goin' to the mall.</p>
<p>I'm not spending any more time with that kid.</p>
<p>Come on, dude! Fine. Great.</p>
<p>Dee... Dee, will you just...</p>
<p>Can we go to the mall? Will you drive me?</p>
<p>I guess, if Dennis watches the bar.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Great. Fine. Thank you.</p>
<p>You're ugly.</p>
<p>You're ugly.</p>
<p>You're ugly!</p>
<p>You are the one that's ugly!</p>
<p>Charlie! Jesus Christ! Are you almost 30?</p>
<p>Are you almost 30 years old?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You have to buy me a toy!</p>
<p>I don't have to buy you shit.</p>
<p>If you don't buy me anything...</p>
<p>I'm gonna tell my mom you took me to a black people's house.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wow! Oh, my God, that's racist. What do you say to that?</p>
<p>I don't say anything.</p>
<p>You still have to buy me a toy!</p>
<p>Charlie, what in the hell are you gonna do if this kid's yours?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>I'll probably, uh, kill myself.</p>
<p>Whoa! Isn't that your waitress from the coffee shop?</p>
<p>Cool. Stewie.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Go talk to her.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Come on. Go talk to her.</p>
<p>No, dude.</p>
<p>You've been in love with this girl forever.</p>
<p>I know that. You know what? Come with me and pretend you're my girlfriend.</p>
<p>It'll make her jealous.</p>
<p>No. I won't do that.</p>
<p>Come on. It's gonna work.</p>
<p>No. No, it's not.</p>
<p>All right. Come stand next to me then.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So she doesn't think I'm creepy.</p>
<p>Well, you are creepy.</p>
<p>I realize this. That's why I need you.</p>
<p>All right. Let's go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Stop sweating.</p>
<p>Then we can grab him if you like him, okay?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Fancy seeing you here.</p>
<p>Oh. Hello, Charlie.</p>
<p>Buying toys, are you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool. This is my, uh...</p>
<p>Friend. We're good friends.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Is that cute little girl your...</p>
<p>I'm her big sister.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hmm, that's weird.</p>
<p>She looks Mexican.</p>
<p>She is Mexican. It's the Big Sister program.</p>
<p>She's not my real little sister.</p>
<p>That is such a coincidence.</p>
<p>That's exactly what we're here doing.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you see that, um... <em>adorable little guy over there?</em></p>
<p>That's Charlie's little brother.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No way. You're involved in the program?</p>
<p><em>Yeah!</em></p>
<p>Well, that's... I didn't know you were involved in the program.</p>
<p>I love the program!</p>
<p>It's one of his favorite programs.</p>
<p>Yeah. I've... I've been in the program since...</p>
<p>A long time now.</p>
<p>I guess you're gonna be going to the picnic then at Fairmount Park.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Saturday?</p>
<p>Saturday.</p>
<p>Yeah. Are you there? Are you goin'? Are you gonna be there?</p>
<p>I will be there on Saturday, yes.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><em>Maybe we'll see you there.</p>
<p>Maybe. Or you know what?</em></p>
<p>Or... maybe we could carpool. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Carpool?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, come on. Think about it.</p>
<p>We'll save the environment.</p>
<p>We'll team up. It'll be good.</p>
<p>This is smart. Reduce, reuse, recycle.</p>
<p>You should do it.</p>
<p>The kids will love it. The kids...</p>
<p>He loves Mexicans.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><em>Sure. Let's do it.</p>
<p>Oh!</em></p>
<p>Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Great. Okay, well...</p>
<p>Nice to meet you too. I'll see you.</p>
<p>I gotta go get my little sister. Okay, bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You're still pretty sweaty.</p>
<p>Baby killer! Baby killer! Baby killer!</p>
<p>You bastards are gonna burn in hell!</p>
<p>Abortion is murder!</p>
<p>It's a child, not a choice!</p>
<p>Pro-choice is pro-death!</p>
<p>Wow! Great rhetoric.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, you're really hard-core, aren't you?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, if you really wanna see hard-core...</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>That's the list of doctors I'm gonna kill.</p>
<p>There's two already crossed out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>So you really had a good time, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. We had a blast.</p>
<p>Hmm. He didn't give you any problems?</p>
<p>No. Not a single problem.</p>
<p>Uh, listen, I was thinking maybe I could take him out this Saturday?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. I'd pick him up at, like, 8:00?</p>
<p>You know, do the father-son thing.</p>
<p>Are you all right? Is that gonna be okay?</p>
<p>Because I could really use... use him.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Is everything all right?</p>
<p>I can't do this!</p>
<p>Tommy's not your son.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>RememberJimmy Doyle from high school?</p>
<p>That son of a bitch is Tommy's real father.</p>
<p>He left me six months ago.</p>
<p>You know what a nightmare it's been since he left?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I can't raise Tommy alone.</p>
<p>I don't care! You thought you'd just pawn your son off on me?</p>
<p>What else? I thought I could find him a better role model than that piece of shit!</p>
<p>Stop talking!</p>
<p>Wait. Let me think.</p>
<p>God! All right. So can I still take him out on Saturday?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><em>That's pretty thin. That might be too thin.</p>
<p>Hey-oh!</em></p>
<p>Hey, Mac. Where you been?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know. Saving humanity.</p>
<p>Are you still on this kick, dude?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, Den...</p>
<p>I was thinking what you were saying the other day... about the T-shirts with the stupid slogans on them.</p>
<p>And I was wondering what you think about this?</p>
<p>Huh, bitch? Yeah!</p>
<p>Is that stupid enough for you?</p>
<p>You're not seriously wearing that, are you?</p>
<p>You look ridiculous.</p>
<p>Whatever, dude.</p>
<p>You know, that's the problem with you antiabortionists.</p>
<p>You cry about the sanctity of life, and then you wear a shirt like that.</p>
<p>I'm not listening to you. - Aren't you right-wingers all about the death penalty too?</p>
<p>Does that not involve killing somebody?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>And you liberals are against killing murderers.</p>
<p>But you're for killing innocent babies.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah. We like to kill babies.</p>
<p>You guys are taking this way too seriously.</p>
<p>Den, you don't understand the week I've been having.</p>
<p>I met a girl at one of these organizations who is a freak.</p>
<p>She is the dirtiest chick I've met in my life.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Yeah. You gotta come with me to one of these rallies.</p>
<p>They're having another one on Saturday.</p>
<p>These chicks are everywhere.</p>
<p>I can jump on board with that.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Are you actually gonna throw away all your convictions for a chance to get laid?</p>
<p>I don't really have any convictions.</p>
<p>Where is this rally being held?</p>
<p>Uh, Planned Parenthood, Bryn Mawr Medical Center.</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna go. At least one pro-choice voice is gonna be heard.</p>
<p>One? There was, like, tons of those chicks at the last one.</p>
<p>Which side had more?</p>
<p>Oh, which one do you think?</p>
<p>The one that cares about protecting women's bodies... or the one that's run by the religious right?</p>
<p>Probably the side you're goin' to.</p>
<p>I'm gonna fight for the right to choose.</p>
<p>You're a scumbag, Dennis.</p>
<p>Today's a big day for me, Tommy.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, today is probably the best chance I'm ever gonna have of hooking up with this girl.</p>
<p>So, uh, look at me for a second, pal.</p>
<p>Okay, do me a favor.</p>
<p>If you're good today, I'm gonna buy you... anything that you want, anything in the world, all right?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I will smash your face into a... into a jelly!</p>
<p>Wrong key.</p>
<p>Keep abortion legal! Keep abortion legal!</p>
<p>Stop abortion now! Stop abortion now!</p>
<p>This is crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, weird. People actually care about women's bodies. You believe that?</p>
<p>Yeah. I think Mac picked the wrong side.</p>
<p>There's, like, no dudes here.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Uh, give me a second here.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I like your look.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>I like the whole hippie thing.</p>
<p>It really works for you.</p>
<p>Get lost, breeder.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. Mmm.</p>
<p>I love the smell of protest in the morning.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><em>I was quoting that movie, you know, Apocalypse Now. "Napalm in the morning."</em></p>
<p>Is that the new Mel Gibson movie?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Did you see Passion of the Christ?</p>
<p>I saw it 12 times.</em></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, you really shouldn't joke about the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>So just fill these out.</p>
<p>We'll get your information in the mail.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>"Keep your laws"...</p>
<p>I like your T-shirt.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah. Where do I sign?</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Love T-shirts like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, do you come to these kind of things often, or...</p>
<p>Are you hitting on me at an abortion rally?</p>
<p>Yeah, I...</p>
<p>You know what? I think all these chicks are gay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know that they're gay.</p>
<p>I think they can just smell how disgusting you are.</p>
<p>That sucks for me.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, Mac. It's Dennis.</p>
<p>Uh, look, man, there's no talent over here.</p>
<p>What's the deal over there?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We're lookin' real good over here, bro.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Hop the fence and come over.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'll see you in a second.</p>
<p>Later, gator.</p>
<p>All right, Megan.</p>
<p>I'm finished.</p>
<p>You are a genius.</p>
<p>Hey, Sis. I'm gonna jet.</p>
<p>You're leaving?</p>
<p>Uh, this side sucks.</p>
<p>I'm gonna try my luck over there.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Later, tater.</p>
<p>Dennis, you are such a jackass!</p>
<p>Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Can I get by here?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I just... I really love that sign.</p>
<p>I wondered that so many times.</p>
<p>Hey, there's a guy on the fence.</p>
<p><em>Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>They're coming after us!</em></p>
<p>No. They're not coming after us.</p>
<p>I'll show you what we do to them. How's your aim?</p>
<p>Pretty good. But I don't think that's such a good idea.</p>
<p>I don't think...</p>
<p>Hey, it's okay. These people deserve this.</p>
<p>Yeah. He looks like he deserves it.</p>
<p>Maybe just one.</p>
<p>Oh! Ow!</p>
<p>Yeah! Come on!</p>
<p>Get your eggs, people!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>shit! They're throwing eggs!</p>
<p>They did this last time.</p>
<p>I came prepared.</p>
<p>Oh. Hey, Dennis!</p>
<p>How's the action over there, buddy?</p>
<p>What? What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh! They're coming...</p>
<p>Now they're coming back.</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Hot chicks on that side, Dennis?</p>
<p>You're gonna burn in hell!</p>
<p>Stop! Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>Hey, guess what.</p>
<p>I have a surprise for you.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's a real miracle.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>I'm pregnant!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm pregnant!</p>
<p>You gotta get an abortion.</p>
<p>Megan, wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>Stop talking to me!</p>
<p>Well, listen, I just think our situation is different.</p>
<p>How is our situation different?</p>
<p>Well, because I didn't mean to get you pregnant.</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>You are so pathetic.</p>
<p>You can't have this kid. I'm way too young, and I have a little bit of an alcohol problem...</p>
<p>Save it! I'm not pregnant!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm not pregnant.</p>
<p>It was a test.</p>
<p>I just thought for, like, one second that you might be the one.</p>
<p>I just had to know for sure.</p>
<p>Wait a second! So you're not pregnant?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And this was a test?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I failed?</p>
<p>Have a nice life, asshole.</p>
<p>No! Wait... Wait...</p>
<p>Wait a second! Wait! Oh.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Where the hell have you been? You said 11:30, dude!</p>
<p>I don't wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>That waitress is picking me up any minute! I was ready to shut down the bar!</p>
<p><em>What is that kid doin' here?</p>
<p>I'm taking him to the Big Brother-Big Sister thing.</em></p>
<p>Get him out of here, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm getting picked up any minute! Will you relax?</p>
<p><em>I told you, I don't want kids in the bar!</p>
<p>Dude, what is up your ass?</em></p>
<p>You... You are out! Whoa, dude!</p>
<p>This kid reeks of booze!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Are you drunk? Don't be drunk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How could you let this happen?</p>
<p>I was the only one bartending! He must have been takin' sips out of people's beers.</p>
<p>All right. Brew some coffee.</p>
<p>You can't give him coffee!</p>
<p>Let go of that! Let go of that!</p>
<p>Get him out of here, Charlie!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Okay, here we go!</p>
<p>Fresh air! Have a seat!</p>
<p>Sit down! Fresh air!</p>
<p>You suck!</p>
<p>You suck, all right? Breathe it in. Fresh air now.</p>
<p>You suck and you have an ugly face!</p>
<p>You suck!</p>
<p>You have an ugly face, okay?</p>
<p>You try and push people's buttons all the time!</p>
<p>And you get in their head, and you drive them crazy!</p>
<p><em>Maybe that's why you don't have a dad anymore!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</em></p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm drunk.</p>
<p>He's drunk?</p>
<p>He's not drunk.</p>
<p>I am drunk!</p>
<p>You're not drunk.</p>
<p>He sounds drunk.</p>
<p>I am drunk!</p>
<p>You're not drunk!</p>
<p>Stop saying that!</p>
<p>He's fine.</p>
<p>Jimmy Doyle!</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>From high school.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I didn't recognize you without all your acne.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, listen, I need to talk to you about your kid.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Uh, let's see. Because your kid has serious emotional problems.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe because you're not there as a father.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You're kidding me? This your little game?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This is what you're doin'? This is what you're doin' to me?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
