<p><em>You're such a dildo, dude.</p>
<p>Thanks, dude.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>That's a good way to start the day.</em></p>
<p>Is that soy veggie health drink supposed to erase the damage... you did to your liver last night?</p>
<p>Is that coffee gonna help you forget that elephant you slept with last night?</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You don't have to be so judgmental.</p>
<p>She was gross, dude.</p>
<p>She wasn't that gross, all right?</p>
<p>If you lowered your standards a bit, you'd get laid more. Give me a sip of this.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I just wanna try it.</p>
<p>You do not get to taste my delicious healthy drink after making fun of it.</p>
<p>Why not? Just give it to me.</p>
<p>'Cause I don't know what kind of diseases that girl had.</p>
<p>She doesn't have any diseases!</p>
<p><em>Dude, she was really gross.</p>
<p>Guys!</em></p>
<p>We got a real serious problem.</p>
<p>There's been a B&amp;E, dude.</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>A B&amp;E, dude!</p>
<p>A B&amp;E?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Somebody broke into the bar and stole our safe.</p>
<p>Breaking and entering. B&amp;E.</p>
<p>No. No!</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>When did this happen?</p>
<p>Last night, I guess.</p>
<p><em>Wejust walked in this morning and found it like that.</em></p>
<p>Who locked up last night?</p>
<p>I did. But that's the thing. The locks weren't even broken.</p>
<p>So somebody just waltzed in here and stole the safe?</p>
<p>But it's not my fault.</p>
<p><em>Well, it's somebody's fault.</p>
<p>I know it's somebody's fault!</p>
<p>Well, it's somebody's fault!</p>
<p>I know that!</em></p>
<p>Guys! Guys! We're not gonna get anywhere yelling at each other!</p>
<p>We need to be rational.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Okay! I think it's clear what needs to happen.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to buy a gun.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>I think next time you boys ought to get the kind of safe... that a relatively small man can't just carry away.</p>
<p>But there's been, like, a string of these robberies all over the area.</p>
<p>You don't have any leads or...</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>
<p>What in the hell does that even mean?</p>
<p>How could there not be any leads?</p>
<p>The guy must have left something behind.</p>
<p>People are working on it.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys.</p>
<p>They're pretty sure it's the same guy who's been hittin' all the bars around here.</p>
<p>We know, Charlie.</p>
<p>So we're done here, Harris.</p>
<p>What... So that's it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We'll call you if we come up with anything.</p>
<p><em>Well, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks.</em></p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let's go get that gun.</p>
<p>Whoa. Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Guns are not a good idea. They're dangerous.</p>
<p>Someone's gonna get hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah. Mac, no guns.</p>
<p>Guys, somebody stole our safe, right?</p>
<p>Am I crazy? We need to be able to protect ourselves... in case something like this happens again.</p>
<p>Clearly, Philly's finest don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Mac is absolutely right.</p>
<p>What if one of us was here when it happened?</p>
<p>We would have been killed.</p>
<p>No, you don't know that. Come on.</p>
<p>Hey, babe.</p>
<p>Hey, Colin.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Was that law enforcement?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is everything all right?</p>
<p>No, dude. We got robbed last night.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Are you kiddin' me?</p>
<p>Oh... What happened?</p>
<p>Remember the other day when you were making fun of us for having such a tiny safe?</p>
<p>That really sucks, guys. Look, we have reservations at Guajino's at 12:00, and...</p>
<p>Yep. Just about...</p>
<p>Guys, it's a travesty. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>No guns.</p>
<p>Dude, your sister has the worst taste in men.</p>
<p>No shit. I hate that guy.</p>
<p>He's like a full-on '80s movie stereotype.</p>
<p>Plus, he's a total player.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You don't know about this?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That guy's dated, like, every hot bartender in town.</p>
<p>I saw him a week ago with Wendy from Dirty Frank's.</p>
<p>Hand all down the back of her pants.</p>
<p><em>Oh! Gross.</p>
<p>Very gross.</em></p>
<p>Whatever, dude.</p>
<p>Charlie, close up shop.</p>
<p>Dennis, let's go get us a gun.</p>
<p>Do you really think they're gonna buy one?</p>
<p>No. I mean, I told them not to... but Mac gets a boner every single time he thinks about a gun.</p>
<p>Well, I think it's a great idea.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm sorry?</p>
<p>I think it's really smart.</p>
<p>Owning and knowing how to properly use a firearm... is an important part of what makes this country great.</p>
<p>Well, that's what I was trying to tell them...</p>
<p>To tell you the truth...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>There's nothing sexier than when you're firing a gun.</p>
<p>Actually, it really turns me on.</p>
<p>Well, that's exactly why I want you to teach me how to use one, sexy.</p>
<p>It would be my pleasure.</p>
<p>I think the pleasure would be all mine.</p>
<p>You've got a poppy seed in your teeth.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
<p>It's a big one. You might wanna go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>Calm down! All right!</em></p>
<p>Hwang.</p>
<p>You're just in time, buddy.</p>
<p>Charlie, my rent.</p>
<p>Okay, listen.</p>
<p>Listen to me for a second while I...</p>
<p>No! I cannot wait anymore!</p>
<p>Don't come over here and just start yelling at me!</p>
<p>Hwang! Hey! Wait!</p>
<p>Let me go get something, and I'll fix it.</p>
<p>All right, hurry up.</p>
<p>Hurry up!</p>
<p>I can't wait too long!</p>
<p>Hwang not patient!</p>
<p>You getting my money?</p>
<p>Would you like a Rice Krispie treat?</p>
<p>$854 you owe me!</p>
<p>I realize how much money it is!</p>
<p>I'm not gonna take it no more!</p>
<p>I placed a couple bad investments!</p>
<p>Hwang!</p>
<p>I placed a couple of bad investments.</p>
<p>It could happen to anyone, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm going to get your... goddamn money by the end of the month, okay?</p>
<p>I come back tomorrow. I want my goddamn money!</p>
<p>Yeah, tomorrow.</p>
<p>I want my money!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Dickhead!</p>
<p>Okay, Dennis. We're gonna be very careful about this, right?</p>
<p>We'll stash it right here just in case we need it.</p>
<p>Until then, we don't go near it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we never have to pick it up again.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<p>You wanna shoot it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>How do you like me now, log?</p>
<p>You totally killed that log, dude.</p>
<p>I totally killed it. I always knew that I'd be good at this stuff.</p>
<p>You're a really good shot, Dennis.</p>
<p>Thanks, bro.</p>
<p>You're pretty good too, Hoss.</p>
<p>You hit the log, like, a bunch of times, man.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>If that log was trying to rob the place, you would have killed it.</p>
<p>I would have killed it!</p>
<p>You totally would have killed it.</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>Hey, you wanna shoot it some more?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, can I load it up though?</p>
<p>Absolutely! You like the sound.</p>
<p>I like the sound of the clip.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing?</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, check it out.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>That's not fun! That's not a toy.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm serious, man. You shouldn't be playing around with guns.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to open the bar.</p>
<p>We got robbed.</p>
<p>Hwang is all over my ass because of rent.</p>
<p>You wanna hold it?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>Come on. Just hold it.</p>
<p>I wanna open the bar!</p>
<p>Hold it for a little bit.</p>
<p>No, I don't wanna hold it.</p>
<p>Fine. Give me the gun.</p>
<p>Fine. Yes. I'll hold the gun. Okay.</p>
<p>Good. Nice.</p>
<p>Really nice feel to it.</p>
<p>That's really good.</p>
<p>Is this thing loaded?</p>
<p>It can be.</p>
<p>That's my boy!</p>
<p>Whoo! That's amazing!</p>
<p>Yeah. Can you feel it?</p>
<p>You bet I can feel it! Come on!</p>
<p>Describe what you feel.</p>
<p>I feel like, uh...</p>
<p>I feel focused and I feel badass and just, um... badass, you know?</p>
<p>I think he's got it, Mac.</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p>Got what?</p>
<p>Charlie, my boy, you've got the gun fever.</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>That's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>You seeing this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That is sexy.</p>
<p>Yep, totally.</p>
<p>You feeling sexy?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. It's all right to be a little nervous.</p>
<p>Everyone's nervous their first time.</p>
<p>But I promise you... once you put your hand around this... you are gonna love it.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I've got something I think you'll love.</p>
<p>I'd rather watch you shoot the gun here.</p>
<p>What if I...</p>
<p>Just shoot the gun, Dee.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why would I not be serious?</p>
<p>All right. Thanks, Detective.</p>
<p>Nothing?</p>
<p>No, nothing. I don't think they're taking this seriously on any level, dude.</p>
<p>Of course they're not, dude.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>These cops don't give a shit about us.</p>
<p>I think it's time we took matters into our own hands.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Maybe we should do a little investigating of our own.</p>
<p>Do some snoopin' around, try to crack the case. We got the gun.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Wanna go shoot it some more?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Let's do that.</p>
<p>Pow, pow, pow!</p>
<p>Whoa! What the hell?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dude, the gun's not here.</p>
<p>Holy shit! What are you talkin' about?</p>
<p>Look! Look!</p>
<p>It's...</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got the gun.</p>
<p>Why, Charlie?</p>
<p>It's supposed to be here to protect the bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I know.</p>
<p>I just, uh...</p>
<p>You just what?</p>
<p>I just needed it.</p>
<p><em>Is this the gun fever talking, dude?</p>
<p>No...</em></p>
<p>It's not...</p>
<p>I don't have the gun fever, man.</p>
<p>Look, I'm coming in to work later.</p>
<p>I'll bring it with me.</p>
<p><em>I really don't like the sound of this, Charlie.</em></p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. I gotta go, dude.</p>
<p>I'll see you guys at the bar.</p>
<p>He hung up.</p>
<p><em>All right! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!</em></p>
<p>I'm coming! All right.</p>
<p>Hang on a second there.</p>
<p>Hey, Hwang.</p>
<p>Okay, so you got my money now?</p>
<p>I got some Rice Krispie treats in the fridge. You want some more of those?</p>
<p>Charlie, I don't like you.</p>
<p>I never liked you.</p>
<p>So just give me my money, or Hwang will be forced to...</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Forced to...</p>
<p>What you doing?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>So, listen, Hwang.</p>
<p>Let me talk to you about your money for a second.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't have it right now, you know?</p>
<p>I just don't have it.</p>
<p>But I'm gonna get it... because I have my ways.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean, Hwang, when I say I have my ways?</p>
<p>What is that? Is that a yes?</p>
<p>Sometimes I can't understand you.</p>
<p>You're talking, but I don't understand you.</p>
<p>So say yes if you know what I mean when I say I have my ways.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, good boy. Get lost.</p>
<p><em>All right. So we got the binoculars.</p>
<p>We got the ziplock baggies.</em></p>
<p>We got the Maglite. I think as soon as Charlie gets here with the gun, we're all set.</p>
<p>This is great, dude.</p>
<p>This is great. We're like the Hardy Boys.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So I'll be Frank.</p>
<p>You be Joe.</p>
<p>'Cause Frank was kind of the leader, and that makes a little more sense...</p>
<p>Didn't Frank have blond hair?</p>
<p>Yeah. But that doesn't make any difference...</p>
<p>So I should be Frank 'cause I have lighter...</p>
<p>The hair color doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It's all about who's making the plans and...</p>
<p>If we're gonna play Frank and Joe Hardy...</p>
<p>But I'm the leader clearly in this partnership!</p>
<p>Why are we talking about this?</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>What's the first step?</p>
<p>So I'm the leader. Great. Let's roll.</p>
<p>Wait, no. We can't go. What are you doing?</p>
<p>We gotta open up the bar.</p>
<p>Or we could call your sister to do her job... that is if she's not having sex with Colin and every other bartender in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Don't do that. It's gross.</p>
<p>Look, dude, we need to jump on this.</p>
<p>Let's go do some investigating.</p>
<p>All right. All...</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p><em>What?</p>
<p>Holy shit!</em></p>
<p>I know who stole our safe.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go get that gun.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, let's get the gun. Wait, wait. Bag, bag, bag.</p>
<p>Oh, the bag.</p>
<p>All right. I'm driving.</p>
<p>Okay. No, I'm driving.</em></p>
<p>I hope Charlie didn't do anything stupid.</p>
<p>Whatever Charlie's doing right now, it's probably pretty stupid.</p>
<p>Let's just hope nobody got hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>Hey, dude.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Can we get that gun?</p>
<p>Oh. Why?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, we shouldn't have to tell you why.</p>
<p>We bought it.</p>
<p>It's ours.</p>
<p>But if you must know, it's because we know who knocked over the bar.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can we get the gun?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we know who... Okay, you know what, dude?</p>
<p>Move. Oh, this place is a shit-hole, Charlie. It smells.</p>
<p>So, don't you wanna know who did it?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Who was it?</p>
<p>Colin.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yeah. Think about it.</p>
<p>It all makes sense.</p>
<p>Colin goes around town... with every hot bartender chick, right?</p>
<p>He woos them with his charm and his good looks.</p>
<p>He finds out where the safes are.</p>
<p>He finds out how to get in.</p>
<p>You remember when Sweet Dee said that he was laughing about how small the safe was?</p>
<p>You saw how quickly he changed the subject when she brought that safe up.</p>
<p>Right. All right.</p>
<p>So what's the plan?</p>
<p>I'll slide the gun meaningfully into the front of my pants...</p>
<p>I know that game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So why don't you go get it?</p>
<p>Go get the gun!</p>
<p>All right. Here.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Do you want it?</p>
<p>Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>Are you with Colin right now?</p>
<p>Oh, no. He had to meet someone at Fingers Bar, huh?</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why don't you take the night off, okay?</p>
<p>You deserve it.</p>
<p>All right. You're welcome. Bye.</p>
<p>Pow, pow, pow.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>Ready, Freddy. Oh.</p>
<p>It goes...</p>
<p>Uh, stick it back in...</p>
<p><em>What a penis!</p>
<p>Like you wouldn't do such a thing?</em></p>
<p>Come on. Let's nail this prick.</p>
<p>Wait. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Didn't Fingers already get robbed?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>So what's this guy doing, going in for round two?</p>
<p>I don't know. Can we do this thing?</p>
<p>Wait. Hold on.</p>
<p>Do you think this guy would be dumb enough to rob the same bar twice?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>All right, change of plans.</p>
<p>Leave the gun.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get this asshole to hit Paddy's again.</p>
<p>Follow my lead.</p>
<p>I'm the leader.</p>
<p>Hey, Colin!</p>
<p>Colin!</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Hey, fellas.</p>
<p>Didn't expect to see you here.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was just... Actually, I was leaving.</p>
<p>Leaving?</p>
<p>Having a little drink, huh? Little drinky-poo.</p>
<p>Couple drinks?</p>
<p>Yeah. Just, uh... Yeah, just a little drink.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>What's up, man? You seem like, uh, the cat who ate the canary.</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>Canary... No, I was just...</p>
<p>I didn't expect to see you guys here.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, I thought you'd be at Paddy's.</p>
<p>Paddy's, no.</p>
<p>We actually closed up shop for the night.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Thought we'd get wasted here instead, you know?</p>
<p>Just a little freaked out about the robbery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, actually, funny story. Turns out the dickhead didn't actually get all of our money.</p>
<p>We actually keep it in the register instead of the safe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the stupid asshole didn't even think to look there, right?</p>
<p>What a cock!</p>
<p>What an idiot! What an idiot! What a total idiot, right?</p>
<p>Boner, really.</p>
<p>Schmuck.</p>
<p>Stupid idiot.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know.</p>
<p>As soon as we get some new locks, we should be all set.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we're just probably gonna hop in here...</p>
<p>Grab a couple drinks here tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah, get wasted.</p>
<p>Maybe pass out.</p>
<p>Or walk home with a couple of hot waitresses.</p>
<p>Right, Colin?</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, well, don't wanna keep you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We'll see you later. You look spiffy, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, you look good.</p>
<p>Maybe you guys should get a gun.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, Dee was saying that you were thinking about getting a gun.</p>
<p>I think it's a good idea.</p>
<p>Good protection. I, uh...</p>
<p>I keep one on me all the time.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p><em>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Enjoy your drinky.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We will. All right, man.</p>
<p><em>Have a good night, bro. Yeah.</p>
<p>See you later.</em></p>
<p>He's got a gun on him at all times.</p>
<p>From now on, so will we.</p>
<p>Dude, you just laid it on way too thick back there.</p>
<p>There's no way he's gonna hit Paddy's again tonight. He'd have to be a moron.</p>
<p>He is a moron, dude.</p>
<p>He'll be there.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah, listen.</p>
<p>There's a change of plans. I need you to meet us at Paddy's tonight after all.</p>
<p>Something you need to see.</p>
<p>Why did you guys bring me into this?</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>Did you turn off the circuit breaker?</p>
<p>Yeah, dude. We're all set.</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Did you just cock back the hammer, bro?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Wait a second. You guys have a gun?</p>
<p>Hey, listen to me.</p>
<p>We are not shooting anybody tonight.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Dennis, you are not shooting anyone!</p>
<p>I don't want to shoot anyone, Sweet Dee!</p>
<p>You better not shoot anybody.</p>
<p>I don't have...</p>
<p>I should be holding the gun.</p>
<p>I have better...</p>
<p>Well, I put this whole thing together.</p>
<p>I shot the log way more times!</p>
<p>This is so bad.</p>
<p>But I'm the one who has better aim than you!</p>
<p><em>What? What? Is he here?</em></p>
<p>Oh, there he is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What's he doing?</p>
<p>He's walking toward the cash register.</p>
<p>Oh, he looks shady.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. That's him.</p>
<p>That's it. Do the flashlight.</p>
<p>Turn the flashlight on!</p>
<p>I can't reach it!</em></p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>He's getting away!</p>
<p><em>Shoot him!</p>
<p>What?</em></p>
<p>Shoot him!</p>
<p>Shoot him in his face!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p><em>Did you get him?</p>
<p>I'm shot!</p>
<p>Charlie? Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh, my god!</em></p>
<p>Turn on the circuit breaker!</p>
<p>Turn on the circuit breaker!</p>
<p>Did you shoot me, Dennis?</p>
<p>L... Uh, no. L...</p>
<p>Why did you shoot me?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>My God! Dude, are you okay?</p>
<p>Where are you shot?</p>
<p>In my head!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Charlie, I shot you in your head. I am so sorry.</p>
<p>Is he okay?</p>
<p>No, I'm not okay! He shot me in my head!</p>
<p><em>No. It must havejust grazed his head.</p>
<p>You shot him in the head, bro!</p>
<p>If I shot him in the head, he'd be dead.</p>
<p>It really hurts!</em></p>
<p>I gotta go to a hospital!</p>
<p>All right, man. I'll call an ambulance.</p>
<p>The hospital's, like, three blocks away.</p>
<p>We should just drive him!</p>
<p>I know that. But I don't wanna get blood stains all over the interior of my car.</p>
<p><em>Are you serious?</em></p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>I'll take you to a hospital! God!</p>
<p>All right, get a trash bag.</p>
<p>We'll put it over him.</p>
<p>I can't believe you shot Charlie, dude.</p>
<p>Don't start this again!</p>
<p>You almost killed our best friend.</p>
<p>You told me to shoot Charlie!</p>
<p><em>You guys told me to shoot Charlie.</em></p>
<p>The minute the shit hits the fan, you guys are, like, "Dennis, don't shoot the gun!"</p>
<p>I was not!</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, you told me to shoot him in the face!</p>
<p>I didn't say that!</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, there he is. How you feeling, buddy?</p>
<p>You shot me, dude.</p>
<p>But, Charlie, you were stealing from the bar. It was an honest mistake.</p>
<p>I still kind of wish you didn't shoot me.</p>
<p>If you needed help with money, why didn't you talk to us?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>L... I had it all worked out, all right?</p>
<p>I was gonna make it look like all the other robberies going on around town.</p>
<p>Then we would collect some insurance money and...</p>
<p>Wow, dude. That's really just goddamn ridiculous.</p>
<p>That is so dumb.</p>
<p>I thought it was the best idea I ever had.</p>
<p>No, it's not at all.</p>
<p><em>But you know what?</p>
<p>It might be the best idea you've ever had, but...</em></p>
<p>Listen. Listen. The important thing is that you are all right.</p>
<p>And we talked about it, and we decided we need to get rid of that gun.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, the gun.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're getting rid of the gun.</p>
<p>It's too dangerous.</p>
<p>You could have been killed. Dennis could have killed you.</p>
<p><em>Okay, good. Yes.</p>
<p>I think that would be for the best.</em></p>
<p>Ah. Mmm.</p>
<p>Dee, could you get me a nurse?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Tell me we're not getting rid of that gun.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p><em>No, he's fine. It turns out itjust kind of grazed his head.</em></p>
<p>Oh, that's great news, babe.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for calling though.</p>
<p>You are so sweet, Colin.</p>
<p>I guess I'm just a sweet guy.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I'll see you tomorrow?</p>
<p>You will.</p>
<p>Okay. Good night.</p>
<p>Dream of me.</p>
<p>Idiots.</p>
