<p><em>Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.</p>
<p>That's not a lot of money.</p>
<p>No, it isn't.</em></p>
<p>And our mortgage is due in two weeks.</p>
<p>We paid that a week ago.</p>
<p>A week ago was three weeks late, Mac.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I met this guy in acting class. He's really cool, and he wants to see where I work.</p>
<p>So could you guys try to not be weird?</p>
<p>What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.</p>
<p>We're cool!</p>
<p>Not cool?</p>
<p><em>Try to be cool.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're not too cool.</p>
<p>Charlie...</p>
<p>Always cool, man.</em></p>
<p>Oh, hey, man, we're closed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Guys, this is Terrell... from my acting class.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, man. How's it goin'?</p>
<p><em>It's going good. How you doin'?</p>
<p>Good, man.</em></p>
<p>We're just chillin', dude.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Just closing up shop.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>We got plenty of brothers.</p>
<p>Yeah... A-African-Americans.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, we get it.</p>
<p>You might know some of them.</p>
<p>Yeah. We're probably related.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related. That's ridiculous.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.</em></p>
<p>We weren't expecting you...</p>
<p>We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><em>When I'm promotin', everybody and their mama gonna be there.</em></p>
<p>There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever.</p>
<p>You got niggas hanging from the rafters.</p>
<p><em>So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place...</em></p>
<p>Whoa. You had 400 people packed into a place?</p>
<p>You damn right. That's my job, man.</p>
<p>And it's mostly college kids.</p>
<p>My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there.</p>
<p>And hookups are good.</p>
<p>But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend...</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><em>I mean my sister.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. Cool.</em></p>
<p>I was just... Because he could mean his friend or his...</p>
<p>Stop talking.</p>
<p>So we're packed into this little place on Walnut.</p>
<p>We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.</p>
<p><em>He's giving you crazy eyes.</p>
<p>The insane, crazy eyes.</em></p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>So I walk over... He's this big, cut Mexican dude... <em>and I look at him and say, "Yo, ese...</em> unless you want to get yo' ass torn apart... you'd better get that look off your face."</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>You just walked right up to him and said that?</p>
<p>I had to, man.</p>
<p>You gotta make the first move.</p>
<p>Always make the first move. You know what I'm sayin'? - L-I know.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.</p>
<p>We're, like, eyeball to eyeball. His grill is right up in mine. It feels like an eternity.</p>
<p><em>Finally...</em> he just opens up his mouth and says...</p>
<p>"I guess you gon' have to tear my ass apart, homes."</p>
<p>Oh, man. So what'd you do?</p>
<p>Took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That's insane!</p>
<p>Okay, I would like to do things like that.</p>
<p><em>I love that guy.</p>
<p>"I took him to the back alley"?</em></p>
<p>Who does shit like that? It's like a movie.</p>
<p>There's something off about him.</p>
<p>Oh, bro, that's racist.</p>
<p>No, asshole, that's not what I meant.</p>
<p>I'll go get the coffee. What do you guys want?</p>
<p>Dude, sit down. Okay?</p>
<p>Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.</p>
<p>I wasn't gonna stare at her. I was just gonna...</p>
<p>He wasn't gonna stare at her.</p>
<p>You're totally obsessed with that chick.</p>
<p>No, I'm not. I like her.</p>
<p>I have a little bit of a crush, yes.</p>
<p>But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.</p>
<p>It's never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.</p>
<p>Why? For what?</p>
<p>You heard him.</p>
<p>When he's promotin', everybody named Mama's looking to get in.</p>
<p>That's true. They do have "niggers hanging from rafters."</p>
<p>Wow. Nice.</p>
<p>No, that's not what I was saying.</p>
<p>Coffee?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hitler?</p>
<p>No, I'm not... I'm not Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.</p>
<p>I was quoting a black friend.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, that's just great.</p>
<p>Now she thinks I'm racist.</p>
<p>Dude, will you just drop it?</p>
<p>Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>Sure about this?</p>
<p>It's 2005, Charlie.</p>
<p>Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?</p>
<p>No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.</p>
<p>It's not stupid!</p>
<p>It's a stupid plan.</p>
<p>It's not... This is a college campus.</p>
<p>This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify...</p>
<p>You're just trying to make black...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You're trying to make black friends.</p>
<p>You're not making it easy.</p>
<p>You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.</p>
<p>Don't do this right now.</p>
<p>Okay. See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>This is perfect.</p>
<p>Huh. Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm gonna break the ice.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.</p>
<p>'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>No. It was really awkward.</p>
<p>Really awkward.</em></p>
<p>Maybe we should go.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, what's your name?</p>
<p>Oh. It's, uh, Charlie.</p>
<p>Do you play bones, Charlie?</p>
<p>I dabble.</p>
<p>Do you want to play?</p>
<p>I could get you a game.</p>
<p>Uh, no, I shouldn't.</p>
<p>I'm not very good, so...</p>
<p>I bet you're really good.</p>
<p>Well, it's been a long time, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>All right. One game.</p>
<p>Domino, bitch!</p>
<p>This is bullshit.</p>
<p>Absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>Why do these people like you more than they like me?</p>
<p>Maybe it's comments like that.</p>
<p>I meant those people in there, not all black people. What am I supposed to say?</p>
<p>You should say something different.</p>
<p>Figure something else out.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Um, I'm Janell.</p>
<p>Oh, hi.</p>
<p>Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I wanted to give you this.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Give me a call sometime. All right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p>Well, you...</p>
<p><em>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>What?</em></p>
<p>That girl's gorgeous.</p>
<p>She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist. She probably has friends for me.</p>
<p>Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We don't really need...</p>
<p>We need black guys, so...</p>
<p>Black guys? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>Let me see your wallet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Give it to me.</p>
<p>Give it...</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Stop making a scene!</p>
<p><em>Just give me the wallet!</p>
<p>Give me the wallet!</em></p>
<p>I can't get the goddamn...</p>
<p><em>It's okay! It's okay, everybody!</p>
<p>You're making a scene.</p>
<p>You're making a scene!</em></p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Ha! Ha-ha! Ha!</p>
<p>Give it to me!</p>
<p>He had it!</p>
<p>Okay! You found it!</p>
<p>I'm gonna tear it up!</p>
<p>No, don't!</p>
<p>Just give me it.</p>
<p>I'll call the black girl. Okay?</p>
<p>Okay, buddy.</p>
<p>We're cool. We're cool.</p>
<p>We're good.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys. See ya.</p>
<p>I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio... which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.</p>
<p>This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out...</p>
<p>You know what, Dee?</p>
<p>I don't wanna hear about your dreams. Okay?</p>
<p>I hate listening to people's dreams.</p>
<p>It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.</p>
<p>If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just... I don't care.</p>
<p>Oh. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I would listen to your dreams.</p>
<p>'Cause your my brother and I love you.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I am.</p>
<p><em>Hey! What's goin' on, guys?</p>
<p>Terrell.</em></p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Hey! What's up? What's up?</p>
<p>How you doin'?</p>
<p>Dennis! What's goin' on?</p>
<p>All right, man.</p>
<p>How's it goin', man?</p>
<p>Good, man.</p>
<p>Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll come outside.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. Well, come on.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put these out on the tables.</p>
<p>Rule number one: Always keep a line.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That is a lot of people!</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>This is crazy!</p>
<p>I know! I told you! Terrell's the best!</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.</p>
<p>L-Look at this!</p>
<p>Why are you making more money than me?</p>
<p>I don't know!</p>
<p>Hey, this is crazy!</p>
<p>I know. Terrell packed 'em in. Look at this.</p>
<p>This is crazy!</p>
<p>Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.</p>
<p>Lot of dudes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.</p>
<p>Lot of dudes.</p>
<p>What can I get you boys?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.</p>
<p>What cute one?</p>
<p>Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Let's go say hey.</p>
<p>Yo, Brettie boy!</p>
<p>Hey, cuz!</p>
<p>Hey! How you doin'?</p>
<p>What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd?</p>
<p>Oh, it's something else!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.</p>
<p>I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.</p>
<p>Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man?</p>
<p>I'm not...</p>
<p>You have the most beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Okay, man, but I'm... Really?</p>
<p><em>So blue.</em></p>
<p>Really more of a blue-green, actually, but...</p>
<p>I'm really proud of you, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p>You've come a long way.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>No! What in the hell is your problem?</p>
<p>How could you not tell me you were gay?</p>
<p>I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was that big a secret.</p>
<p>I've been coming on to you for weeks now.</p>
<p>Just thought you were into gay dudes.</p>
<p>I am not into gay dudes!</p>
<p>Apparently you are.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you know what?</p>
<p>The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar.</p>
<p>They are not happy.</p>
<p>So much money!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Oh! So much money!</p>
<p>We made more money in one night...</p>
<p>Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place!</p>
<p>We have to embrace the situation.</p>
<p><em>We should totally embrace the situation!</em></p>
<p>We're a gay bar from now on.</p>
<p>Absolutely, man!</p>
<p>No goddamn way.</p>
<p>Have you guys seen this?</p>
<p>"Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud?</p>
<p>Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole."</p>
<p>That's a nice notice.</p>
<p>No, it's not nice.</p>
<p>I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.</p>
<p>Of course you are.</p>
<p>I made $300 last night.</p>
<p>How much did you make?</p>
<p>First of all, that's rude. And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with it.</p>
<p>I don't think we have much of a choice.</p>
<p>We need to do this.</p>
<p>If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid.</p>
<p><em>Maybe you did it to get laid. I got a little something I like to call business ethics.</p>
<p>Business ethics? The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you.</em></p>
<p>Okay, chill out.</p>
<p>You're gonna screw it up.</p>
<p>Screw it up? I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>It's a purely fiscal decision.</p>
<p>Oh, bullshit. You don't care about the money.</p>
<p>You just like the attention.</p>
<p>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>"Everybody look at me!"</p>
<p>You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.</p>
<p>Hey, handsome.</p>
<p>Hey, beautiful.</p>
<p>Hey, sexy.</p>
<p>Hey, hoss.</p>
<p>I just get along really well with those guys.</p>
<p>They're vibing.</p>
<p>No, you're leading them on.</p>
<p>You're not gay, you're just really vain.</p>
<p>Okay, time out. Here's what we should do.</p>
<p>Let's take a vote.</p>
<p><em>Fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</em></p>
<p>All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."</p>
<p>Aye.</p>
<p>Aye. Opposed?</p>
<p>K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you're the bartender. You're not one of the owners.</p>
<p>No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.</p>
<p>No, she doesn't!</p>
<p>Of course I get a vote!</p>
<p>All owners opposed, say "nay."</p>
<p>All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay."</p>
<p>All people who own the bar who are opposed... say "nay."</p>
<p>Nay.</p>
<p>Two against one! Oh, well.</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Hey-hey! What's going on?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Look at you! You look good!</p>
<p>Oh, thank you. That's so sweet.</p>
<p>So, where we going?</p>
<p>Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.</p>
<p>Oh, I want one so bad.</p>
<p>All righty!</p>
<p><em>Oh, a coffee shop.</em></p>
<p>I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Uh, why don't you have a seat here.</p>
<p>I'll go get the coffee.</p>
<p>What would you like?</p>
<p>I don't really drink coffee. Let me see.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>What do you want, Charlie?</p>
<p>"What do you want, Charlie?"</p>
<p>I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman... sitting at the table over there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That woman is my friend.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>So, the other day when you heard me saying something... about certain people hanging from said rafters...</p>
<p>I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens...</p>
<p>What are you trying to say?</p>
<p>Spit it out.</p>
<p>Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on...</p>
<p>Dude, N-O.</p>
<p>How many times do I have to say it to you?</p>
<p>One time is fine.</p>
<p>Apparently one time is not fine.</p>
<p>One time per time I ask you.</p>
<p>Hey, what's going on up here?</p>
<p>Oh, not too much.</p>
<p>Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.</p>
<p>Then he asked me out on a date.</p>
<p>Charlie, is this true?</p>
<p>Would that upset you if it was something that was true?</p>
<p>You need to see a doctor. This thing looks really bad.</p>
<p>I did!</p>
<p>What'd he say?</p>
<p>He said thatJanell punched me in my eye!</p>
<p>All right, well, you need to keep that i...</p>
<p>Wait. Her name's Janell?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>JanellJenkins.</p>
<p>She's got a hell of a right hand.</p>
<p>She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.</p>
<p>Are you two seeing this?</p>
<p>Boys are out tonight, huh?</p>
<p>This is unbelievable.</p>
<p>What is going on here?</p>
<p>You got black women crawling all over you... and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.</p>
<p>Why do these people like you guys so much?</p>
<p>It's not that they like us.</p>
<p>It's that they don't like you.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Uh, because you're an asshole!</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you in back for a second?</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>You know that girlJanell? I know her.</p>
<p>Okay. So what?</p>
<p>So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.</p>
<p>Great. How?</p>
<p>We gotta start with Dennis.</p>
<p>Can you get him so drunk tonight? On tequila.</p>
<p>But a lot of it.</p>
<p>Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. No problem.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.</p>
<p>But seriously... blackout drunk.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right?</p>
<p>No. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>You take the salt...</p>
<p>Take the salt.</p>
<p>And then you take the shot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then you suck on the lime. Okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Why don't you show me again.</p>
<p>'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.</p>
<p>You lick it.</p>
<p>Salt. Lick it.</p>
<p>And then you slam it.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first...</p>
<p>No, no, no, no... Oh... Oh, please, please, dude.</p>
<p>You're not listening to me.</p>
<p>Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.</p>
<p>You do the salt first.</p>
<p>The salt first.</p>
<p>And then the lime.</p>
<p>Show me again, because I'm not...</p>
<p><em>The salt first.</p>
<p>Then the lime.</em></p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Hello, lover.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>What the hell!</p>
<p>What is going on here?</p>
<p>Relax, stud. You got nothing to be ashamed about.</p>
<p>What the f...</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p><em>Did we have...</p>
<p>No. No.</em></p>
<p>Don't be silly.</p>
<p>It was all hands.</p>
<p>How's that ass feelin'?</p>
<p><em>I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.</em></p>
<p>You're doing the right thing, bro.</p>
<p>I think so too, dude.</p>
<p>I feel really good about broadening my horizons.</p>
<p>It's gonna be fun.</p>
<p>It's a good business decision.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.</p>
<p>What, dude?</p>
<p>Oh, no. What happened?</p>
<p><em>Just, uh... I was doing some thinking and, you know...</em></p>
<p>We had our little experiment. It was great.</p>
<p>But we should go back to normal.</p>
<p>Oh. You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.</p>
<p><em>Interesting.</p>
<p>The bar.</em></p>
<p>We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great. Let's go back to normal.</p>
<p>You're done experimenting?</p>
<p>Or are you gonna experiment some more?</p>
<p>What is this experimenting?</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis! What's up?</p>
<p>Listen, I got you some new CDs.</p>
<p>'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.</p>
<p>Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.</p>
<p>'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.</p>
<p>Can we talk for a second in private?</p>
<p>Yeah. No problem.</p>
<p>So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.</p>
<p>We're gonna have to let you go.</p>
<p>I thought you were happy.</p>
<p><em>No, we were happy. But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, we had that experiment...</p>
<p>Why do you keep saying it like that?</p>
<p>You guys are being ridiculous.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're being ridiculous!</p>

<p>Hey, everybody!</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>What is going on here? You guys know each other?</p>
<p>Yeah! That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye!</p>

<p>Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean...</p>
<p>I mean my sister.</p>
<p><em>Yes! Okay!</p>
<p>This is great!</em></p>
<p>Because earlier you were implying that I was racist...</p>
<p><em>because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.</em></p>
<p>And then it turns out that you people actually are!</p>
<p><em>No, that's not what I meant. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I meant that you two actually are.</em></p>
<p>Mac? Stop talkin'.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to tell you.</p>
<p>That didn't work out.</p>
