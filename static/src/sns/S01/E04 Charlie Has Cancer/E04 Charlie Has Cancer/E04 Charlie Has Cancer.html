<p><em>Yo, Charlie! It's Dennis!</em></p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, dude.</p>
<p>What's up, buddy?</p>
<p>Hey, your face looks, uh, like, poofy.</p>
<p>Uh... Uh, yeah, I've been cryin' a little bit.</p>
<p>Huh? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Hey, do you have that basketball?</p>
<p>Mac and I were about to go play in the park.</p>
<p>I think you...</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I might. Come on in.</p>
<p>Yeah? Okay.</p>
<p>Wow, dude! I thought my place looked like shit.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's wrong? You look, uh, hungover or something.</p>
<p>No. Yeah, it's...</p>
<p>I found out I might have cancer, so ooh.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I found out I might have cancer.</p>
<p>That's why I haven't been down to the bar recently. And, uh...</p>
<p>Jesus, dude.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>You don't have to say anything.</p>
<p>Here, check these pamphlets out.</p>
<p>They go over cancer, cancer-related issues.</p>
<p><em>You know, it feels actually pretty good to get this off my chest, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I've been sittin' in here boohooin' a little bit.</em></p>
<p>So, uh...</p>
<p>I mean, I'm glad we can talk.</p>
<p><em>We can talk, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Of course. Yeah, talk. We can always talk.</p>
<p>Awesome, dude.</em></p>
<p>All right, so it starts out I'm not feeling good.</p>
<p>I'm havin' headaches and...</p>
<p>Uh, did you want to talk, like, right now?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I was thinking we could talk right now.</p>
<p>Well, it's not really a good time.</p>
<p>It's just that Mac and Sweet Dee are down in the car waitin' for me.</p>
<p>I told them I'd just, you know, zip in and zip out.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. All right.</p>
<p>I could ask 'em to wait.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>I really shouldn't.</p>
<p>Then don't.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, look, man.</p>
<p>Keep... Keep your head up. You're gonna get through this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do me a favor though. Uh, don't tell anybody.</p>
<p>I don't want it gettin' around.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no. I won't say anything.</p>
<p>Thanks. All right.</p>
<p>Uh... Uh...</p>
<p>Could I get the... the basketball though?</p>
<p>It's just we're supposed to meet, like, a bunch of people... and we were supposed to bring that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no. You're... Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Charlie's got such great hair.</p>
<p>Is he gonna lose all of his hair?</p>
<p>Yeah. He probably is.</p>
<p>Well, so what kind of cancer is it?</p>
<p>I don't know, man.</p>
<p>Well, when does he go in for treatment?</p>
<p>He didn't say.</p>
<p>You know, we just stood there for a long time and didn't say much, you know?</p>
<p>And we cried together, and I held him for a while... and that was it.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>That is so sad. He is gonna look so bad without that hair.</p>
<p>We gotta do somethin' nice for him. We should go back.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>We can't go back.</p>
<p>He made me promise not to tell anybody.</p>
<p>So when we see him we're supposed to act like we don't know anything?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no. That's not right at all.</p>
<p>We can't just abandon him right now.</p>
<p>He needs people around him.</p>
<p>He shouldn't be alone.</p>
<p>I learned a lot in my theater and psych classes about the human nature...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dee, you know what?</p>
<p>Nobody cares about your psych or theater training.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Dee's right.</p>
<p>Let's think about this.</p>
<p>What's the one thing that Charlie never gets?</p>
<p>Laid.</p>
<p>Right! So let's find a girl for Charlie.</p>
<p>No, not at all what I was saying actually.</p>
<p>No, no. Let's find...</p>
<p>Let's find a girl for Charlie... someone to be there for him... spend time with him, you know, nurture him.</p>
<p>Bang him.</p>
<p>Have sex with him, right.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>You have any friends desperate enough?</p>
<p>Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p>I'm not helping you with this.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Don't be a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I am not be...</p>
<p>Speaking of which, anybody want to get up off their ass and help me with the boxes?</p>
<p>The boxes? That's what Charlie does.</p>
<p>Charlie's job, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I can't do it all by myself.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>So Charlie's wasting away, and we're gonna talk about Sweet Dee's feelings all morning.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? I love Charlie very much.</p>
<p>But this is a stupid idea you guys have. So you know what?</p>
<p>Oh! Whatever!</p>
<p>I am not helping you with it.</p>
<p>Whatever. You know what, Dennis? We don't need her.</p>
<p>You're right. We don't need her.</p>
<p>What we'll do is we'll find a girl for Charlie tonight in the bar.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</p>
<p>No, you won't.</p>
<p>Yes, we will.</p>
<p>There are never any girls in this bar.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</em></p>
<p>I told you.</p>
<p>I don't get it, Dee.</p>
<p>There are tons of women in this city.</p>
<p>Where do they go?</p>
<p>Uh, they're at the velvet-rope clubs on Delaware Avenue. - Why?</p>
<p>Dennis, our bar is in South Philly in a scary alley.</p>
<p>Might as well call it rape Bar.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>The problem is that every time a beautiful girl comes into a place like this... it's always the biggest asshole that winds up accosting her.</p>
<p>Carmen, you have the most amazing body.</p>
<p>Are you bulimic, or what?</p>
<p>No. I work out, like, every day.</p>
<p>Yeah, it shows.</p>
<p>You look like you work out too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>One would think actually.</p>
<p>But it's pretty much all natural.</p>
<p>Dennis, maybe you need to rethink this whole plan of yours.</p>
<p>I don't think getting Charlie laid is gonna help his cancer problem.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Dennis, I found the perfect girl for Charlie.</p>
<p>Smart, beautiful, the whole thing.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p><em>Right there.</p>
<p>Over by the pool table?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Nice.</p>
<p>That's great, Mac.</p>
<p>Good work, Mac.</p>
<p>That's a dude.</p>
<p>No. The one with the exposed midriff and the cans.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's Eric Wyzotski's cousin.</p>
<p>Carmen, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Carmen.</p>
<p>Tranny.</p>
<p>Implants?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Not bad. It's good.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look at his jeans, dude.</em></p>
<p>There's an unmistakable bulge of a large penis in those jeans.</p>
<p>There's a dick in those pants.</p>
<p>There's a dick in those pants.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Excuse me, bro.</p>
<p>Can you give me a second?</p>
<p>Thanks. Is that a penis in your pants?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You lied to me.</p>
<p>No, I didn't.</p>
<p>You lied to me.</p>
<p>You don't work out?</p>
<p>Please. I've seen you at the gym.</p>
<p>You're ripped.</p>
<p>No. Don't turn this around. Wait.</p>
<p>Really? You think so?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was afraid I was getting a little too ripped, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, no. I like it.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p>Um, but I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll give you a call.</p>
<p>What do you want, Charlie?</p>
<p>I like your bracelet.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That's one of those, uh, Lance Armstrong "Race for the Cure"...</p>
<p>"Live Strong" kind of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool. That's very cool.</p>
<p>You must be a very compassionate person.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Did you want something from me, or...</p>
<p>What time are... are you getting off of work?</p>
<p>It's not a thing to walk away about.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Dennis, I don't have time to talk to you about this.</p>
<p>But we found the perfect girl for Charlie.</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>Okay, you know the waitress over at the coffee shop... the one that he's been in love with forever?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, okay. He saw her wearing one of those Lance Armstrong "Race for the Cure"...</p>
<p>"I Love People that are Dying of Cancer" type bracelets.</p>
<p>That's really cool.</p>
<p>Well, so that bracelet probably means... that she's compassionate towards sick and dying people.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That's what that symbolizes.</p>
<p>You know what that symbolizes? Those bracelets symbolize jumping on fashion trends.</p>
<p>And you know what the thing that's so rad is?</p>
<p>They come in all kinds of colors now, so you can accessorize your compassion with your outfits.</p>
<p>Really cool.</p>
<p>All right. All right.</p>
<p>Well, be that as it may, we still need you to talk to her... because the whole thing is gonna sound so much better coming from a girl.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't have time since, apparently...</p>
<p>I'm the only one who does anything around here anymore.</p>
<p>And second of all, it's gross!</p>
<p>I'm sure that there's something Mac and I can do for you... that will convince you to help us.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Dee is in.</p>
<p>Sweet Dee's in what?</em></p>
<p>She is in... way over her head.</p>
<p>In what?</p>
<p>Debt.</p>
<p>Huh. I know that game.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a beer.</p>
<p>You want one? Great.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Nice cover, dick.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>So Sweet Dee's in?</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, under one condition.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She gets to punch you in the face.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Right in the face.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The Christmas party.</p>
<p>How about that game against Dallas... when Santa came out at halftime and we threw batteries?</p>
<p>She grabbed me from behind.</p>
<p>It was instinctual.</p>
<p>I know that, man.</p>
<p>You don't grab.</p>
<p>You don't grab from behind.</p>
<p>Not from behind.</p>
<p>That sucks because if Sweet Dee's out, we need to find another girl quickly.</p>
<p>Uh, well... We, uh, you know...</p>
<p>We kind of need her.</p>
<p>We kind of need Sweet Dee.</p>
<p>You're sayin'... Are you talking about letting Sweet Dee punch me in my face?</p>
<p>Charlie has cancer.</p>
<p>"So you're new here, yeah? Who are you?"</p>
<p>Who am I? I'm just a small-town girl... who moved to the big city with big dreams... just to find out... the only way to make it in the big city... is to shake it.</p>
<p>And that's what I do... at the Coyote Ugly.</p>
<p>End scene.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Artemis, that was amazing.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>That really means a lot.</p>
<p>But you won't be seeing me in class anymore.</p>
<p>I lost my job at the Wawa.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Are you doing another scene? L... I...</p>
<p>I won't be able to pay my bills!</p>
<p>I'm thinkin' about goin' on welfare!</p>
<p>What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Ow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis. It's Dee.</p>
<p>I was...</p>
<p>What are you listening to?</p>
<p><em>Uh, Rick Astley. What's up?</em></p>
<p>Oh, nothing. Only I just solved all of our problems.</p>
<p>Really? - Mm-hmm. Except for Charlie and the whole cancer thing.</p>
<p>But I did figure out how to get help at the bar.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Dee, we talked about this.</p>
<p>No, no. Just listen.</em></p>
<p>I was thinking we could do that whole Coyote Ugly theme.</p>
<p>You know, where the girls dance on top of the bars...</p>
<p><em>take their bras off and stuff.</p>
<p>I'm listening.</em></p>
<p>Okay, well, I have a friend who would be absolutely perfect for it.</p>
<p>She'd work for tips only.</p>
<p>And she would even come in... and interview with you, so you could see if you liked her.</p>
<p>Would she wear the, uh, hot pants, tank top, wanna-hump-hump pumps?</p>
<p><em>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Do it.</em></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Only under one condition.</p>
<p>I don't wanna help you get that waitress to sleep with Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Sis.</p>
<p>We need you.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? You gotta choose.</p>
<p>Charlie's waitress or a hot new bartender?</p>
<p><em>Sweet Dee's out.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. She's too busy training this new bartender.</em></p>
<p>Apparently, she's got this hot new friend who sh-she...</p>
<p><em>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Carmen.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>That's a three-pointer.</em></p>
<p>What are you guys, uh...</p>
<p>What are you doin'?</p>
<p>Just watchin' a basketball game.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I was just leaving actually.</p>
<p><em>Oh, oh, no, no, no. You know what?</p>
<p>I was gonna leave.</p>
<p>I mean, you... you... you could...</em></p>
<p>No, it's okay. I've got a hair appointment in, like, 20 minutes.</p>
<p>It was nice to see you.</p>
<p>It was good to see you.</p>
<p>So I'll see you tonight?</p>
<p>Oh. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I'll pick you up at 8:00?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She's gettin' it removed.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>I'm just puttin' in my time, you know?</p>
<p>So that afterwards I'll be...</p>
<p>Gross, dude.</p>
<p>First.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p><em>This is just pathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>All right. Let's roll.</p>
<p>W-Wait. Well... Well, what's the plan?</p>
<p>The plan is that you're gonna distract Charlie, okay?</p>
<p>I'm gonna march up to that waitress, tell her that he has cancer. All right?</p>
<p>She's gonna feel sorry for him, and then she's gonna sleep with him.</p>
<p>That's not gonna work.</p>
<p>You can't just do that.</p>
<p>Well, what do you wanna do?</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis.</p>
<p>Charlie has cancer.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's so sad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm... I'm all right.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p><em>You did what?</p>
<p>I slept with her.</em></p>
<p>Charlie's been in love with that girl for months.</p>
<p>I know, man. I don't know what happened.</p>
<p>I mentioned the cancer thing.</p>
<p>She instantly started comin' on to me.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. You were right about that.</p>
<p>Cancer... gold mine.</p>
<p>What... What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Don't worry. I got a plan.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>Bam? What's that?</p>
<p>$200.</p>
<p><em>Why?</p>
<p>Well, Dennis was thinking that that might help...</em> convince you to sleep with our friend Charlie.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>250.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Hey, Carmen!</p>
<p>Hey, yo, Carmen!</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Charlie has cancer.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You poor baby.</p>
<p>I'll be right down.</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis! Could you help me with this keg, please?</p>
<p>Uh, I slept a little funny on my neck.</p>
<p>Hey, is your friend gonna be doin' stuff like this?</p>
<p><em>Um...</p>
<p>Hello.</em></p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>I'm Artemis.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'm here for the audition.</p>
<p>I'm just a small-town girl... who moved to the big city with big dreams... just to find out... the only way to make it in the big city... is to shake it.</p>
<p>That's what I do.</p>
<p>Shake it. Shake it.</p>
<p>You wanna see me shake it?</p>
<p>Of course you do.</p>
<p>They all do.</p>
<p>I shake it.</p>
<p>Shake it.</p>
<p>I shake it.</p>
<p>I shake it. I shake it.</p>
<p>I sha...</p>
<p>You cannot possibly have thought that this was gonna be a good idea.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what? This is so you.</p>
<p>I tell you I need some help behind the bar.</p>
<p>I finally find someone who's perfect, and she'll practically work for free.</p>
<p>And just 'cause she doesn't have the right measurements or whatever, you freak out.</p>
<p>Oh, you just want somebody to do all the grunt work for you.</p>
<p>Shh! She's gonna hear you.</p>
<p>I don't care!</p>
<p>Hey-oh!</p>
<p>What's goin' on?</p>
<p>Gotta pee.</p>
<p><em>Hey, buddy?</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>What's goin' on, man? You seem really happy.</p>
<p>Uh, I feel pretty happy.</p>
<p>Do you? What happened?</p>
<p>I think you know what happened.</p>
<p>Uh, I might.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think you do know. You talked to that waitress, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It totally worked. It totally... I don't know what you said, but we went out on this date.</p>
<p>She really likes me. So thank you, man.</p>
<p>You're welcome, man!</p>
<p>Yeah, you seem flush. You seem like a...</p>
<p>I feel like a...</p>
<p>I feel like an ice cream sundae, you know?</em></p>
<p>That's great, man. That is terrific. It must really take your mind off things then, huh?</p>
<p><em>Sure, yeah. What things?</p>
<p>Well, you know, the... cancer.</em></p>
<p>Here's the thing though... about cancer.</p>
<p>I don't have it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Mom, I'm telling you, this girl's amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got butterflies in my stomach.</p>
<p>There's one little issue.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I think you broke my nose!</p>
<p><em>That guy's beatin' on that chick!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</em></p>
<p>Oh, no. You know what?</p>
<p>It's a dude. Yeah, she has a penis. So it's okay.</p>
<p>Dude, isn't that a hate crime?</p>
<p>shit, yeah, it's a hate crime!</p>
<p>How could you do this?</p>
<p>Oh, well, excuse me for bein'... the most terrible man on the planet!</p>
<p>L... I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm a terrible man!</p>
<p>What are you doing? What is that?</p>
<p>We thought you were dying, Charlie.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Who's we?</p>
<p>Me and Mac and Sweet Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, great! Great.</p>
<p>I told you not to tell anyone!</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna have to go into remission or something so they don't think I was lying.</p>
<p>You were lying!</p>
<p>Yeah. I lied to you, all right?</p>
<p>Look. The girl... she wears a Lance Armstrong bracelet.</p>
<p>Okay? So I tell you that I have cancer, right?</p>
<p>Then you're gonna tell her.</p>
<p>She's gonna feel sorry for me.</p>
<p>We're gonna start dating.</p>
<p>And that's the way that life works, man!</p>
<p>That was a horrible thing to do!</p>
<p>Well, I'm a bad guy then.</p>
<p>You are a bad guy! You lied to us.</p>
<p>All right, look at this.</p>
<p>Sometimes you gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet.</p>
<p>You gotta crack a couple eggs to make an omelet?</p>
<p>You gotta crack an egg.</p>
<p>So you're throwing down life lessons now?</p>
<p>I'm throwin' down eggs!</p>
<p>Class is in session.</p>
<p>The teacher's teachin' class now!</p>
<p>I'm crackin' eggs of wisdom.</p>
<p>Is that what you're doin'?</p>
<p>Let me crack one more egg for you and throw it in the omelet!</p>
<p>You got an egg?</p>
<p>The waitress doesn't even like you.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>We had to pay her $250 to have sex with you!</p>
<p>Aha! Because...</p>
<p>sex?</p>
<p>We didn't have sex.</p>
<p>Hey! Guess what, Dee.</p>
<p>You're gonna love this. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Give me a second.</p>
<p>Charlie was lying the whole time.</p>
<p>He doesn't have cancer.</p>
<p>Well, how could you not tell me... that you paid her to have sex with me?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I don't understand how you could possibly be so...</p>
<p>You can't lie about having cancer!</p>
<p>It's not something you do!</p>
<p>We thought you were dying!</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, listen!</p>
<p>You're never gonna believe what happened!</p>
<p>I accidentally punched that tranny in the face.</p>
<p>These two guys started chasing me.</p>
<p>Dee, get me a beer.</p>
<p>It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>I ran all the way here. Go.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, what the hell do you guys want?</p>
<p>Well, it's funny. It's a, uh... It's a funny, funny thing.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>Uh, we paid you $250 to sleep with Charlie and...</p>
<p>And you never actually had sex with him.</p>
<p>So we were wondering if we could get the 250 bucks back.</p>
<p>If you could toss that back our way, that'd be great.</p>
<p>Is it... Is it locked?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She's probably gettin' the money though, right?</p>
<p><em>Dennis!</em></p>
