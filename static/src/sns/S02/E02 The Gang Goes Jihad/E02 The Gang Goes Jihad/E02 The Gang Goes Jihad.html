<p><em>I just need to get some leverage here.</p>
<p>Okay. Just pull.</p>
<p>I'm tryin'to pull it, dude.</p>
<p>Pull harder, Dennis.</p>
<p>If I pull harder...</em> it's gonna dig into his leg.</p>
<p>Don't yell at me.</p>
<p>I need to jam the shears farther down...</p>
<p>Jam 'em in there!</p>
<p>Pull harder, and I will!</p>
<p>Dude, you should get a doctor to do this.</p>
<p>Oh, look at me!</p>
<p>The millionaire who goes to see doctors!</p>
<p><em>Come on. Just pull the damn crowbar...</p>
<p>Okeydokey.</em></p>
<p>Charlie, you want...</p>
<p>You want the cast off?</p>
<p>That's what you wanted. That's what you were asking for.</p>
<p>Just soak it in hot water, and it gets soft and it peels right off... piece by piece.</p>
<p>What do you know about anything?</p>
<p>What are you even doing here?</p>
<p>Why are you still here?</p>
<p>Just want to be part of the gang.</p>
<p>You're not part of our gang.</p>
<p>You're not part of the gang either, Dee, so forget that.</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>You're not. The gang is me, Mac and Charlie. That's the gang.</p>
<p>Dennis, let your sister be part of the gang.</p>
<p>She can't be part of the gang.</p>
<p>Why would you say that?</p>
<p>Is she part of the gang?</p>
<p>What gang?</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Come on! Pull on it!</p>
<p>Hello. Excuse me. I'm looking for the owner.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's us.</p>
<p>We're the owners.</p>
<p>My name is Ari Frenkel.</p>
<p>I just bought the building next door.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Great, man. That's awesome.</p>
<p><em>I purchased it a few months ago, but I was just able to move my family into Philadelphia.</em></p>
<p>Ah, yeah. Where from?</p>
<p>Israel.</p>
<p>Just got to be too dangerous... you know, with everything that's happening.</p>
<p>Well, that's a tough situation you got over there.</p>
<p>You got that whole tsunami...</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, the Superdome thing that...</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>No, there's no Superdome.</p>
<p>It's one of those places over there.</p>
<p>It's a different country.</p>
<p>Why don't you shut up?</p>
<p>Never mind. I had a...</p>
<p><em>Anyway, I just... Yeah, it's all good.</em></p>
<p>Stopped over to give you this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>It's a notice to vacate.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, according to the zoning grid, the piece of property...</em> that I purchased extends exactly 100 feet to the north.</p>
<p>Anything south of that dividing line belongs to me.</p>
<p>Well, where's the dividing line?</p>
<p>Mmm, right about... here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>Gonna need you outta here in a week.</p>
<p>You can't do that.</p>
<p>Dad, stay out of this. We can handle it, all right? - L-Look-Look, man!</p>
<p>You can't just come in here and steal our land from us.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm pretty sure that's how this country was founded in the first place.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>You're making things up now.</p>
<p>I don't know what that means.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what...</p>
<p>If you're talkin' shit about America, we are gonna kick your ass.</p>
<p>I'm sure you will.</p>
<p>This is our bar.</p>
<p>Your bar... is on my land.</p>
<p>Good-bye, gentlemen.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>This guy comes...</p>
<p>He really gets my goat.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You shouldn't be allowed to come in, tell people, "Hey, I own this. I own that."</p>
<p>Okay, the butter goes on, then the peanut butter.</p>
<p>Hmm? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Peanut butter go in the middle?</p>
<p>With the choc...</p>
<p>Don't... Do not put peanut butter on that!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A grilled Charlie has peanut butter last.</p>
<p>Okay, either inside or outside.</p>
<p>Peanut butter outside.</p>
<p>Chocolate inside.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><em>Butter inside. Cheese outside.</p>
<p>Go away.</p>
<p>Frank, it's me. Open the door.</em></p>
<p>Oh, shit. It's my wife.</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p><em>Okay, man, we talked about this, right?</em></p>
<p>We knew this day would come. Okay?</p>
<p>We got to face it. We got... Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let it out.</p>
<p>Say "I can do this."</p>
<p>I can do this.</p>
<p>All right. Go answer the door.</p>
<p>No, no, no. You answer the door. I don't want to get smacked.</p>
<p>I'm not... Okay, look...</p>
<p>Where are your balls, dude?</p>
<p>Where are your balls? Okay? You're a grown man.</p>
<p>Think about your balls.</p>
<p>Where are your balls? Start swinging...</p>
<p><em>Charlie, don't talk about my balls.</p>
<p>Open this door!</em></p>
<p>I can't even mention your balls around you. Okay.</p>
<p>Charlie, she's all hopped up on amphetamines.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>I'll get your back, and...</p>
<p>I can hear it in her voice.</p>
<p><em>Look, if you don't do this now, you're never...</p>
<p>Frank, open the goddamn door... before I put my foot through it!</p>
<p>Just do it.</em></p>
<p>Just deal with the bitch.</p>
<p>Hey, Barbara.</p>
<p>Don't you "Hey, Barbara" me.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank. This place is a shit hole!</p>
<p>Is this how you've been living?</p>
<p>We make it work. What do you want?</p>
<p>I want to talk.</p>
<p>I tried to talk to you weeks ago.</p>
<p>You went on vacation.</p>
<p>I was trying to scare some sense into you.</p>
<p>You were talking about giving away all of our money.</p>
<p>My money.</p>
<p>I made it, you spent it.</p>
<p>Burn. There you go, buddy.</p>
<p>How can you say that to me?</p>
<p>After everything I've done for you.</p>
<p>While you were out making money, who do you think was at home... cooking and cleaning and raising your children?</p>
<p>A series of Mexican women.</p>
<p>A series... Unbelievable, dude.</p>
<p>You're on fire.</p>
<p>You can choose to live like an animal if you want to... but I refuse to be subjected to it.</p>
<p>I want my shit back. You took my shit from our home, and I want it back.</p>
<p>I didn't take anything.</p>
<p>It's empty. Someone came in and took everything.</p>
<p>Maybe you should have somebody deported like you used to in the old days.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>I can't even talk to you anymore.</p>
<p>Standing up for yourself.</p>
<p>Standing up for immigrants!</p>
<p>I don't know what you're turning into, Frank, but it's making me sick!</p>
<p>Stings, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It hurts really bad.</p>
<p>Yeah. You got a little hand mark.</p>
<p>Dude, you're burning! You're burning!</p>
<p>Ooh, shit!</p>
<p>All right, all right. With the peanut butter...</p>
<p>You have ruined this one!</p>
<p>No, no. Put the peanut butter on...</p>
<p>You ruined that one.</p>
<p><em>Apparently, Mr. Frenkel is citing a zoning grid...</em> that was created by the original city planners.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>So this asshole's using a law that's, like, 300 years old?</p>
<p>That's bullshit!</p>
<p>Yeah. You can't do that.</p>
<p>You guys had an opportunity to buy the land at the time of the original purchase.</p>
<p><em>You declined.</p>
<p>So what?</em></p>
<p>You also had a second opportunity when the fiscal quarter...</p>
<p>Let's not get into the blame game here, man.</p>
<p>Solutions.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's talk solutions.</p>
<p>How do we get this guy out of our bar?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though you guys have any legal recourse.</p>
<p>We don't have any...</p>
<p><em>legal recourse.</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I think I follow, fellas.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We don't have any...</p>
<p>Legal recourse.</p>
<p><em>What you're saying is, uh, we got to get creative.</em></p>
<p>If you're implying that I'm advising you to do anything illegal... then I'm afraid you're mistaken.</p>
<p>No, of course we're mistaken.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Yeah, no.</p>
<p>We're mistaken. No, we would never want to implicate certain parties... in certain matters, but...</p>
<p>No. But if certain parties who has, uh, certain experiences...</p>
<p>Or connections.</p>
<p>Certain affiliations.</p>
<p><em>Uh, affiliations, uh, could give us some tips or pointers...</em> or even, you know, connect us to one of his guys...</p>
<p><em>we could really, uh...</em></p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Okay. I think the lawyer's right.</p>
<p>We gotta send this guy some kind of message.</p>
<p>It's time to take action, but we should be careful.</p>
<p>I don't want to come off as anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>This guy's a Jewish person...</p>
<p>What's that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We don't have a problem with Jews.</p>
<p>It's this guy in particular.</p>
<p>Jewish, okay? He's Jewish.</p>
<p>Don't use the word "Jew."</p>
<p>I don't appreciate that.</p>
<p>Nah, that's okay.</p>
<p>That is a racial slur, Charlie, and...</p>
<p>Calling somebody a Jew... who is a Jew is not a racial slur.</p>
<p>Please stop. No.</p>
<p>Will you please not use the word "Jew"?</p>
<p>It makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It's not anti-Semitic. - It's about the context. If you use the right context... you're good.</p>
<p>You're the most misinformed person I've ever met.</p>
<p>You don't even know what's going on in Israel.</p>
<p>Okay. That's right.</p>
<p>You don't know what's going on in Israel.</p>
<p>Maybe you shouldn't be speaking on the subject.</p>
<p>Are you guys serious?</p>
<p>Maybe you should leave it to me.</p>
<p>Do you know what's happening in Israel?</p>
<p>Of course, bro. I read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, you know what?</p>
<p>Why don't you crack an egg of knowledge all over me, buddy?</p>
<p>Okay. Can I start?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, okay. There's a war on terror, Charlie.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen CNN?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay. George Bush right now...</p>
<p>Well, start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has the oil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Charlie, it is a war on terror.</p>
<p>We have decided... to help the people of Israel...</p>
<p>To give our oil back to us...</p>
<p>By defeating Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>My head is, like, swelling with knowledge.</p>
<p>It's freedom, Charlie.</p>
<p>With wonderful knowledge.</p>
<p>You're being sarcastic... when we're talking about our...</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>You can't hide from it forever.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>You're an idiot.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Stupid customers.</p>
<p>It smells like urine in here.</p>
<p>Mama, you're back.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna get scurvy if I come any further, am I?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'll tell you how I am, Deandra.</p>
<p>I am devastated. I don't understand what is going on with your father. And I...</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>What? Oh!</p>
<p>Are those my earrings?</p>
<p>Oh... Y-Yea... Yeah.</p>
<p>But here's the thing about the earrings...</p>
<p>You're stealing from your mother now?</p>
<p>What kind of monster are you?</p>
<p>Dad said he was gonna give all your stuff away, and then it was actually Dennis's idea...</p>
<p>Don't blame this on your brother.</p>
<p>How low can you sink, Deandra?</p>
<p>I haven't seen you for a month, and I'm standing here in a neck brace.</p>
<p>Are you gonna ask how I'm doing or what happened or...</p>
<p>I assume you did something stupid.</p>
<p>Dennis ran over me with his car.</p>
<p>There you go again!</p>
<p>Don't you think it's about time you start taking responsibility for your actions?</p>
<p>L...</p>
<p>I want my possessions returned.</p>
<p>I was eating that, Mother.</p>
<p>I've been running around.</p>
<p>I haven't had time to feed the dog.</p>
<p>Could you stop thinking about yourself for once?</p>
<p>And besides, you don't need it, sweetie.</p>
<p>Well, that's attractive.</p>
<p>Maybe if you took a bit more pride in your appearance... you could find a man, and then you wouldn't have to steal from your mother!</p>
<p>I mean, look at your skin, Deandra.</p>
<p>Christ, there is a sun in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>He's already got a construction crew in there working?</p>
<p>Oh, God, dude. I am sick of staring at this building, guys.</p>
<p>We gotta take some action.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Let's throw a flaming bag of poop in the window.</p>
<p>What? Why?</p>
<p>Because they stamp it out and they get poop all over their shoes.</p>
<p>What in the hell is that going to accomplish?</p>
<p>Poop on their shoes.</p>
<p>Their shoes, dude.</p>
<p>Sh...</p>
<p>Are you retarded?</p>
<p>Poop on the shoes.</p>
<p>Are you a retarded person?</p>
<p>Poop on the shoes, man.</p>
<p>I've got it.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's come back tonight.</p>
<p>I got a plan.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah. This ought to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, so what's the next step?</p>
<p>There is no next step.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>This is it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is your plan?</p>
<p>It's awesome.</p>
<p>This isn't gonna do shit!</p>
<p>What do you mean this isn't gonna do shit?</p>
<p>There needs to be a next step!</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to get toilet paper off a building, especially if it rains?</p>
<p>This Jew's in for a ton of work.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Whoa. What?</p>
<p>Come on, man. You can't say things like that.</p>
<p>What did I say?</p>
<p>You dropped a hard "J" on us.</p>
<p>Jew? You guys said it...</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>You can say it, but it has to be in the right context.</p>
<p>You guys said I could say "Jew."</p>
<p>You can, but in the right context.</p>
<p>Well, what is the right context?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, this, you know...</p>
<p>Person of theJewish faith...</p>
<p>Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>In a group of other people from theJewish faith...</p>
<p>Then I said...</p>
<p>This guy's got a ton of work to do!</p>
<p>I think it's okay that he's Jewish.</p>
<p>That is not what I'm...</p>
<p>That's not what he's...</p>
<p>Okay. Hold on a second...</p>
<p>You guys don't know what the hell you're talking about.</p>
<p>This man is in for a ton of work.</p>
<p>He's Jewish.</p>
<p>We know what we're talking about.</p>
<p>Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hello, Frank.</p>
<p>I noticed you changed the locks on the door.</p>
<p>You didn't have to do that... because I'm never coming back here again.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>You seem happy.</p>
<p>I think I'm feeling satisfied for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>What is that, musk?</p>
<p>That's my new friend. I met him outside of that disgusting bar our children own.</p>
<p>That's his Mercedes across the street.</p>
<p>His wife's dead.</p>
<p>Good-bye, Frank.</p>
<p><em>Hey!</p>
<p>You!</em></p>
<p>What are you doing here with my wife?</p>
<p>Soon to be ex-wife.</p>
<p>I'm not doing anything.</p>
<p>She invited me over for coffee.</p>
<p>Are you bangin' him?</p>
<p>You bangin' this guy?</p>
<p>Not yet, but I'm giving it serious consideration.</p>
<p>Is there some problem here?</p>
<p><em>Adultery... that's what this is.</em></p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p><em>Animal!</em></p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>He used to beat me, you know.</p>
<p>Change of plans.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Your mother seems happy.</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>I just can't have that, Dee.</p>
<p>Well, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>What's the one thing your mother loves more than anything in this world?</p>
<p>That teeny, tiny little dog.</p>
<p>Let's go steal it.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Go get the dog, Deandra!</p>
<p>What are you doing with your hands?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>What's all this?</p>
<p>Dog. Kitchen.</p>
<p>That's "kitchen"?</p>
<p>Why can't you go get the dog?</p>
<p>Because I got a cast on my foot.</p>
<p>I got a neck brace.</p>
<p>Deandra, I'm your father.</p>
<p>Go in and get the dog.</p>
<p><em>You mean the dog?</p>
<p>You're out of your mind.</em></p>
<p>Oh. Hello.</p>
<p>Please don't bite me.</p>
<p>Okay. Do not bite me.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Nothing weird is going on.</p>
<p>shit! Run! Run!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I've got something here... that's gonna send our friend on the first train back to Israel.</p>
<p>Eggs?</p>
<p>Yeah. These eggs are organic.</p>
<p>They're, like, three times the size of normal eggs and twice the price.</p>
<p>If this doesn't show this guy we mean business, nothing's gonna.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Whoa. What are you talking about, you're in?</p>
<p>Hey, it's something, Mac.</p>
<p>Oh, it's something.</p>
<p>Let's just do something.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it took him to get that toilet paper down.</p>
<p>Didn't even notice the toilet paper.</p>
<p>What? Where does...</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>He put up a fence.</p>
<p>He didn't notice the toilet paper? He put up a fence.</p>
<p>He walled us in.</p>
<p>He walled us in!</p>
<p>Where does it end and where does it begin?</p>
<p>This guy's good.</p>
<p>Okay. This guy wants to get extreme?</p>
<p>Let's get extreme.</p>
<p>Screw the eggs.</p>
<p>How far does this thing go?</p>
<p>Back to the bar. Plan "B."</p>
<p>It's locked. You guys have your keys?</p>
<p>Go around front.</p>
<p>Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Fine. Fine. Fine.</p>
<p>Wait. Hold on. It gets thinner.</p>
<p>Squeeze through there.</p>
<p>It gets thinner, Dennis!</p>
<p>Wait! Don't push me!</p>
<p><em>Wait, wait, wait! My toe's caught in the fence!</p>
<p>Go back!</em></p>
<p>That's fine. Just go back. Just go back.</p>
<p>I can't move! I can't...</p>
<p>Come on! You guys gotta go!</p>
<p>Stop yelling!</p>
<p>Stop yelling!</p>
<p>Go over! Go over! I'll lift you.</p>
<p>Don't climb! Don't climb, Dennis!</p>
<p>That son of a bitch! He put up a wall!</p>
<p>Hop over!</p>
<p><em>Hop?</p>
<p>Climb over!</p>
<p>Happy place!</p>
<p>Climb over and get help!</em></p>
<p>Oh, this son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Okay. Now what are we doing, holding it for ransom or something?</p>
<p>I haven't thought this all the way through.</p>
<p>You haven't thought it through?</p>
<p>It destroyed my apartment.</p>
<p>Look. We're living in the moment.</p>
<p>We're running around stealing things.</p>
<p>We're doing anything we want.</p>
<p>Stop talking like that.</p>
<p>You and I ought to team up on stuff like this more often.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we shouldn't.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. And also...</p>
<p>You're not on my team.</p>
<p>I want to team up with Mac, because he seems stupid enough to do anything.</p>
<p>Okay, knock it off. You're not teaming up with any of us. Nobody wants you around.</p>
<p><em>Oh...</em></p>
<p>God damn it. That doesn't...</p>
<p>I'm gonna sit here until you use words.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>Your mother might be here, so take the dog into the bedroom.</p>
<p>That's fine. You take it.</p>
<p>You take the dog! I'm telling you!</p>
<p>Fine. Okay, but this is exactly why you're not part of our gang.</p>
<p>God damn it! Where'd it go?</p>
<p>What the hell do you want?</p>
<p>Your wife says she's afraid of you.</p>
<p>I'm here for the dog.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>That woman is amazing.</p>
<p>She is amazing.</p>
<p>You just met her. She's already got you running errands for her.</p>
<p><em>She's good.</p>
<p>She is good.</em></p>
<p>Just go get the dog.</p>
<p>I don't have the dog.</p>
<p>So you've been in here tearing apart pillows and... pooping on the floor?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I'm starting to lose patience with you people.</p>
<p>I've already had to deal with your son and his retarded friends.</p>
<p>My contractor just told me there's a gas leak in that goddamn building I just bought.</p>
<p><em>The whole thing is becoming a big pain in my ass.</em></p>
<p>Go get the dog.</p>
<p>I have a little business proposition I want to talk to you about... out in the hallway.</p>
<p><em>You guys feeling extreme?</em></p>
<p>Ah, this looks beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Okay. You guys ready for this?</p>
<p>I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's do this.</em></p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>And... action.</p>
<p>Cut, cut, cut, cut!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>That's what those tapes sound like.</p>
<p>Why don't you read the script I wrote?</p>
<p>I'm not reading the script. It's in English and riddled with spelling errors.</p>
<p>You know what I'm trying to write. Say it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna mumble guttural sounds.</p>
<p>Let's do another one.</p>
<p>He's not gonna know what you're saying!</p>
<p>We'll do subtitles.</p>
<p>I feel like I should have something in my hands.</p>
<p><em>You don't need anything in your hands.</p>
<p>Like a weapon.</em></p>
<p>A machete or a machine gun.</p>
<p>Why don't you head down to the Wawa and pick up a machine gun?</p>
<p>Read the script.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna read the script.</p>
<p>Who's the director here?</p>
<p>I don't care. I'm not reading the script.</p>
<p>Fine. Action!</p>
<p>Bro, can I get my towel over my face again?</p>
<p><em>Put your towel on your face.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Action!</em></p>
<p>I'm gonna get a weapon!</p>
<p>You don't need a...</p>
<p>He's gonna go get a weapon, everybody!</p>
<p>Everybody! Everybody get a weapon!</p>
<p>Can we... You think we can make this look more like a cave?</p>
<p>You not make restaurant here.</p>
<p>Bad decision.</p>
<p>We will crush your skull with our weapons!</p>
<p>We can't send this.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>We're gonna get arrested.</p>
<p>Yeah, or murdered.</p>
<p>This is a little too extreme, Charlie.</p>
<p>Man, I feel sick.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>What, you think I don't feel sick?</p>
<p>Okay. I'm sick.</p>
<p>I feel very sick, but I directed the shit out of this video.</p>
<p>This stuff is gold.</p>
<p>You're not the one on TV... dressed like a terrorist threatening Jews, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac...</p>
<p>That context was fine, Dennis. Trust me.</p>
<p>I was thinking about it when we were watching the video.</p>
<p>All right. Okay.</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do then?</p>
<p>Can I throw a bag of poop through the window?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I have better aim than you.</p>
<p>I should throw the bag of poop.</p>
<p>Dude, I sat over the bag for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I'm throwing it.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>We're gonna throw this bag of poop through this guy's window.</p>
<p>You wanna come? Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Hey, there's no one even in there!</p>
<p>Well, just throw the bag in anyway, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no one's gonna get poop on their shoes!</p>
<p>Just throw the damn bag, Charlie.</p>
<p><em>All right! Oh!</p>
<p>Why are we doing this?</em></p>
<p>We're gonna teach this guy a lesson.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>This is gonna be great.</p>
<p>It's gonna smell so bad in there.</p>
<p><em>I just hope he gets the message.</em></p>
<p>Uh, I think this is the wrong message.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, so this here... is the pillar that I want to remove.</p>
<p>I want to get this out of here so there's a nice wide open space... when people walk into the bar.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Dad?</p>
<p>In a second, Dennis. And, uh, go into the bathroom. Check out the fixtures.</p>
<p>I'll be in in a second.</p>
<p>What the hell's going on?</p>
<p>He's renovating my bar.</p>
<p>Your bar?</p>
<p>Yeah, my bar.</p>
<p>You see, the property that I just purchased... extends from Morgan Street all the way to right here.</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>The property you bought?</p>
<p>The building you blew up.</p>
<p>The building you set on fire.</p>
<p>What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out about that? Hmm!</p>
<p>I'll give you two choices.</p>
<p>I'm part of the gang... or I send your asses to jail.</p>
<p>I would rather go to jail than work with you.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Just for the record, I would rather not spend my life in jail.</p>
<p>I will tear this bar to the ground.</p>
<p>I will kick the pillars in!</p>
<p>Nobody's kicking anything.</p>
<p>She will kick the pillars!</p>
<p>I will tear...</p>
<p>Okay, here's what we're gonna do! Everyone, relax.</p>
<p>Frank, congratulations.</p>
<p>You're captain of the gang.</p>
<p><em>No! Charlie...</p>
<p>Charlie, shut your mouth!</em></p>
<p>Why can't you just die and leave your money to your kids... like normal parents of America?</p>
<p>You sound like your mother.</p>
<p>You say that to my face!</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I will kick and tear...</p>
<p>Excuse me!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We're looking for the owners.</p>
<p>Oh. We're the owners.</p>
<p>I'm Detective Tanner.</p>
<p>This here is Detective Volpe.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we're gonna have to talk to you for a moment.</p>
<p>About what?</p>
<p>You gentlemen know anything about this?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Oh... shit.</p>
