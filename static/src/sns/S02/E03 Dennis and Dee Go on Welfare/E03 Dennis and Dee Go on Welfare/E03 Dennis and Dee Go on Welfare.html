<p><em>Dennis, stop acting like a child.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear it, Dad.</p>
<p>Deandra, move the pool table so you and your brother can lay some grout.</em></p>
<p>I am not laying grout.</p>
<p>You guys are being babies.</p>
<p>Babies.</p>
<p>We're being babies, Mac?</p>
<p>Why don't you go work for your dad all day?</p>
<p>My dad's a meth dealer.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, no!</p>
<p>My daddy's in prison!</p>
<p>My daddy used to give hot shots to prostitutes.</p>
<p><em>Feel sorry for me!</p>
<p>I got the grout.</em></p>
<p>Dad, you're not even listening to us.</p>
<p>Are you really leaving?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Later, bitches.</p>
<p>Yeah, have a good life now.</p>
<p>All right, look.</p>
<p><em>I know what you're doin'. I can play this game.</p>
<p>Mac and me and Charlie can run the bar.</em></p>
<p>Great. Terrific. Good idea.</p>
<p>Great. We got better things to do.</p>
<p>Please. What are you two gonna do?</p>
<p>Dee and I have a little something we like to call "goals."</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>
<p>We have aspirations outside of this bar.</p>
<p>We got big dreams, Mac.</p>
<p>We're gonna go follow 'em.</p>
<p>You guys have nothing without this bar.</p>
<p>Don't worry about us, Mac.</p>
<p>We'll be just fine.</p>
<p><em>So what are your dreams?</p>
<p>Hmm?</em></p>
<p>Your goals. What are your aspirations?</p>
<p>Were you serious about that?</p>
<p>Yeah! What are you doing?</p>
<p>Signing us up for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Unemployment? No.</p>
<p>Dee, that's for deadbeats. Come on.</p>
<p>We got a golden opportunity here.</p>
<p>You know? We can do anything we want if we put our minds to it.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I could use this time to get my acting career off the ground.</p>
<p>And I fully support you.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Absolute... The old Dennis would have said, "Dee, your sad little acting ship sailed a decade ago.</p>
<p>It's pathetic." But the new Dennis says that it's not my place to kill your pipe dreams.</p>
<p>You should go for it.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes! Come on. This is America!</p>
<p>We're gonna go for it! We're gonna work hard!</p>
<p>We're gonna reach for the stars! We're gonna become more successful than our parents.</p>
<p>We can shove it in their faces.</p>
<p>Make 'em eat shit!</p>
<p>Oh, look, we qualified.</p>
<p>Really? How much?</p>
<p>400 a week.</p>
<p>400... That's more than we made at the bar.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Okay, new plan.</p>
<p>We're gonna go on unemployment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's what it's there for, right?</p>
<p>In the meantime... we will focus and work hard and keep our nose to the grindstone.</p>
<p><em>Right?</em></p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Wha... Why can you not lift your end?</p>
<p>I don't know, dude. Let me figure out what is happening.</p>
<p>Are you lifting with your back?</p>
<p>Of course I'm lifting with my back.</p>
<p>I think your end is lighter.</p>
<p>The balls have rolled down to this end.</p>
<p>No! You got to snap your back up and lift.</p>
<p>I'm jerking my back up! What do you want from me?</p>
<p>Hey, what's the ruckus?</p>
<p>I'm trying to conduct important business back there.</p>
<p>We finished with the tile.</p>
<p>Now we're trying to move the pool table back.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>Have you done the urinal?</p>
<p>Because the urinal, you flush it, and it sprays all over the place.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Look, bro. You gotta stop bossing us around, okay?</p>
<p>I mean, look at Charlie.</p>
<p>You're breaking his spirit.</p>
<p>Look at me. I'm broken, dude.</p>
<p>Look, I'm...</p>
<p>You guys need a father figure.</p>
<p>And I'm trying to be that father figure... and someday you're gonna thank me for it.</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>Trust me. Trust me on that one.</p>
<p><em>You're gonna thank me for it.</em></p>
<p>I don't want a father figure.</p>
<p>Come down just a little bit.</p>
<p>He's not hitting it that high, you know?</p>
<p>Now you should split the difference.</p>
<p>You got to split the difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, split the difference.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>Oh, living the dream, bro. Living the dream.</p>
<p>I thought you two were out looking for careers or something.</p>
<p>We are. We're just getting a little bit of assistance to help us out over the hump.</p>
<p>And this unemployment thing is so great, because we've made really big plans.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be a veterinarian.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I am gonna move to New York, and I'm gonna be on Broadway. - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What? It's 1:00 in the afternoon, and you're piss-ass drunk.</p>
<p>Well, it's a slow process, man.</p>
<p>It takes a little time. But we trust the system.</p>
<p>Is that a new watch, dude?</p>
<p>It is. It's awesome.</p>
<p>And I got a Jesus chain.</p>
<p>It's good. Look at it.</p>
<p>All right, look, guys. We want you to come back to the bar, okay?</p>
<p>Why in the hell would we do that?</p>
<p>You're not even listening to me.</p>
<p>Did you see myJesus chain?</p>
<p>I'm busting my ass in that bar... and you guys are sitting on the stoop getting drunk all day long?</p>
<p>What, this again? What, this again?</p>
<p>I have to work!</p>
<p>Cry for me. Cry for me.</p>
<p>I don't know how to take advantage of government programs.</p>
<p>Unemployment runs out. And once it does, you guys are gonna be back out on your asses.</p>
<p>Once it runs out, we're gonna go on welfare, dude.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Welfare?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You guys can't go on welfare.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>It's reserved for people who need it, you know?</p>
<p>Like poor people who need some help thr...</p>
<p>It's set up to continue...</p>
<p>It's not for overprivileged pieces of shit who want to waste millions of dollars in tax...</p>
<p>You want to play this game?</p>
<p>We gonna play this game now?</p>
<p>Goddamn you!</p>
<p><em>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Charlie, sign here, here and here.</em></p>
<p>So, you're giving me all your money.</p>
<p>Charlie, for the 500th time, I'm not giving it to you. It's not yours.</p>
<p>I'm just setting up a temporary account in your name.</p>
<p>What my wife can't find, she can't get.</p>
<p>Right. This is good. This is shady, Frank.</p>
<p>I like this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But you will be handsomely rewarded if you just keep your hands off this money.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So what's the vig?</p>
<p>The vig?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>You know, what's... what's the vig on this action here?</p>
<p>Do you even know what "vig" means?</p>
<p>Hey-ohh!</p>
<p>What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>Get your gloves. I got a lot of grout work for you to do.</p>
<p>Forget the grout.</p>
<p>I have been doing a little research that will change our lives forever.</p>
<p>Turns out there's a little program called Work for Welfare... in which businesses hire potential welfare recipients... the government subsidizes their wage... and the I.R.S. Affords thousands of dollars in tax relief.</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p>Dude, is that a question?</p>
<p>I don't understand. What's going on?</p>
<p>Don't you get it?</p>
<p>We will never need Dennis and Dee again.</p>
<p>We hire a couple people, pay them nothing, and get them to do all of our work for us!</p>
<p>We just pay them nothing?</p>
<p>We pay them nothing!</p>
<p>That's incredible.</p>
<p>It's incredible!</p>
<p>What do you think, Frank?</p>
<p>Well, if we're gonna do something like this... we got to make sure we don't abuse anybody.</p>
<p>No. Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I know what it's like to grow up poor.</p>
<p>We got to treat people with respect.</p>
<p>Respect is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Respect is number one!</p>
<p>It's the name of almost every game.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because we understand the plight of the worker.</p>
<p>The plight!</p>
<p>Respect.</p>
<p>Respect the plight.</p>
<p>What do you think, Frank?</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>Go get us some slaves.</p>
<p><em>No, dude.</p>
<p>That's not what I'm saying.</em></p>
<p>All I'm saying is that "slaves" is not a racist term.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Look, dude, I'm... Okay, look.</p>
<p>I'm saying over the history of time, right?</p>
<p>There have been slaves of many different races.</p>
<p>There's been Jewish slaves.</p>
<p>I mean, uh, Italian, uh...</p>
<p>I recognize that, Charlie.</p>
<p>But in this country, we have to understand that it is a sensitive issue, okay?</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>What about that one? He seems strong.</p>
<p>Look at those massive thighs.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are good thighs.</p>
<p>But you're gonna have a problem with work ethic.</p>
<p>That's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>You can't be saying things like that.</p>
<p>No, dude.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that because he's black. He's asleep in his chair.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>What about that one?</p>
<p>Don't just do that.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>I knew you were gonna do that. Why are you going to him?</p>
<p>That's like reverse affirmative action, dude.</p>
<p>You don't want to do that.</p>
<p>You could cheat yourself out of a good slave here.</p>
<p>Well, how do you know he's not gonna be a good slave?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You know what? This is so complicated and confusing. I don't even understand.</p>
<p>Let's look at this guy.</p>
<p>We got to talk to someone. Let's just talk to someone.</p>
<p>Hello. Hi.</p>
<p>We are here to sign up for the Work for Welfare Program.</p>
<p>My associate and I were just out on the floor.</p>
<p>We're looking for a suitable candidate.</p>
<p>But the problem is it's really tough to tell just by eyeballing these people.</p>
<p>So we were wondering, like, do you have, like, a face book?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or anything that we can go over, like their physical stats and some kind of numbers...</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Like weight, power...</p>
<p>Something to just "expediate" the whole process.</p>
<p>It doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>Why don't you read up on some of the program's stipulations?</p>
<p>Ooh, that's big.</p>
<p>The face book?</p>
<p><em>No. Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p>It's, uh, sort of a legal document.</em></p>
<p>Now, is there any way around this?</p>
<p>Ohh, you're right.</p>
<p>None whatsoever.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, well...</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>We got this, so we'll read it.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
<p>I'm not reading that.</p>
<p>No, I'm not reading this either.</p>
<p>We'll get Frank to do it.</p>
<p>Maybe get a slave to do it.</p>
<p>Look what the cat dragged in.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Oh, well, look here.</p>
<p>I see you've decided to steal our welfare idea.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm surprised.</p>
<p>We're not stealing your idea, okay?</p>
<p>Let's all recognize that this is a little awkward situation... between friends at the welfare store.</p>
<p>Let's go our separate ways, okay?</p>
<p>You guys can't get welfare!</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. We can.</p>
<p>No, you can't!</p>
<p>They don't give it to any jackass that walks in here.</p>
<p>It's reserved for people who need it.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>drug addicts, mentally disabled, people with dependents... that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Mac, we've got it covered, okay?</p>
<p>Dee, your bicycle helmet.</p>
<p>Later, boners.</p>
<p>That is an awesome helmet.</p>
<p>What... Go! Out!</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hi. Um, I'm a recovering crackhead.</p>
<p>This is my retarded sister that I take care of.</p>
<p>I'd like some welfare, please.</p>
<p>You're a recovering crack addict?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And she's mentally retarded?</p>
<p>Oh, most definitely.</p>
<p>You have the proper medical paperwork?</p>
<p>Medical paperwork?</p>
<p>We're gonna need a physician's report to confirm your sister's mental illness... and your blood work to confirm your... crack addiction.</p>
<p>Well, can't you see how retarded she is?</p>
<p>Lose the helmet, Sis.</p>
<p>We can't prove that you're retarded.</p>
<p>I want that welfare, Dennis.</p>
<p>I know you do. So do I.</p>
<p>No, you don't understand.</p>
<p>I got a taste of my dream. I can't go back.</p>
<p>I got to get to Broadway, and welfare's the key.</p>
<p>What do you want to do?</p>
<p>Oh, they want to play rough?</p>
<p>We can play rough. Let's go buy some crack.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>We're all set. Friday, 3:00. Full blood work.</p>
<p>Okay. We'll just smoke a little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Just enough to get into our system.</p>
<p>Then we'll go to the doctor, we'll get all of our paperwork, and we'll get full benefits.</p>
<p>Then we'll collect for just a little while until we get settled.</p>
<p>Then I'll take the MCATs.</p>
<p>And I'll move to New York. Perfect.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p>Ooh, wow, you scared us.</p>
<p>Oh, not 'cause you're black. No, we're not racist.</p>
<p>No. God, no.</p>
<p>It's just that the neighborhood is scary.</p>
<p>If you were another ethnicity...</p>
<p>You really did pop up.</p>
<p>But it's a nice neighborhood.</p>
<p>No, the trees are...</p>
<p>It's the nature of this...</p>
<p>Roll your window down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What you need?</p>
<p>Uh, one, please.</p>
<p>One what?</p>
<p>Uh, one rock of crack.</p>
<p>One crack...</p>
<p>A crack rock. Is that enough?</p>
<p>Is one crack rock enough?</p>
<p>See, I don't... - How much would you recommend for a first-time user?</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>I'll make you a deal.</p>
<p>Two for the price of one.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds good.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, that's very nice of you.</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>Uh, $200?</p>
<p>Okay. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Sounds reasonable. Great.</p>
<p>Okay. Let's see here, uh...</p>
<p>That should be about 200.</p>
<p>Thanks for being so kind. - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And patient.</p>
<p>Pick it up down there.</p>
<p>Wait. Where?</p>
<p>Wh-Which...</p>
<p>This one.</p>
<p>It's got to be that guy.</p>
<p>Don't say "this one."</p>
<p>Now, Maria, after you're done in the bathroom you come look for me... because I got some boots to be shined, all right?</p>
<p>Tony, go chase that leak down in the basement, all right?</p>
<p>Okay, boss.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Mac, I got to hand it to you.</p>
<p>This is brilliant.</p>
<p>That's how I roll. Charles?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get nice and drunk, play some video games until my eyes bleed.</p>
<p>Amen to that, brother.</p>
<p>Me too. I want to play Charlie.</p>
<p>Uhh, don't you have, like, some stuff that you need to do?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, managerial stuff.</p>
<p>Managerial stuff!</p>
<p>No, I got that all cleared up.</p>
<p>And then I thought after we played a video game...</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>The three of us go outside, throw the pigskin around, play some two-hand touch.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>Hey, that's not gonna... that's not gonna work out.</p>
<p>I'll teach you how to play.</p>
<p>I already know how to play.</p>
<p>Not properly though.</p>
<p>Kind of properly.</p>
<p>Right. Uh, oh, Charlie.</p>
<p>You know what? We got to get into the bathroom to show Maria...</p>
<p>The mixing!</p>
<p>Charlie has this thing... the scrubbing.</p>
<p>Scrubbing!</p>
<p>Charlie has this scrubbing thing with the Brillo.</p>
<p>I have a Brillo.</p>
<p>He has a method, and we gotta show her.</p>
<p>And make sure she's got it down.</p>
<p>All right. I'll get myself a beer.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah, get a beer. We'll work it out over here.</p>
<p>Well, this is a development I did not expect.</p>
<p>It's like he's really trying to become our father.</p>
<p>I know how to play football, Charlie.</p>
<p>I know you do, bro.</p>
<p>I know you do.</p>
<p>Do you want me to leave?</p>
<p>Huh? No, you're good. Just... Actually, make sure you really work that sponge in there.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, that stain, like, it'll...</p>
<p>It's not gonna get clean if you don't.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's gonna get worse.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do? We gotta ditch him or something.</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>How about you and me, we go out on the town? You know what I mean?</p>
<p>We celebrate this whole... slave situation.</p>
<p>I'd love to, Charlie. I really would.</p>
<p>But we don't have any money.</p>
<p><em>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Oh, I got money.</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a whole bunch of money, bro.</p>
<p>Frank's been hiding all of his money in my account.</p>
<p>And why was I not made aware of this before?</p>
<p>Uh, it's got something to do with the vig.</p>
<p>What's a vig?</p>
<p>Well, you know how gangsters, they talk about a vig?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>And it means...</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, a vig!</p>
<p>A vig.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, you should have a vig.</p>
<p>I should have a vig, right?</p>
<p>And Frank didn't give me one.</p>
<p>Oh, that's bullshit! You deserve a vig.</p>
<p>I do. I'm a good guy, right?</p>
<p>You're a great guy.</p>
<p><em>I'm a great guy!</p>
<p>We're all great guys who deserve vigs.</em></p>
<p>We're good people.</p>
<p>All right, here's the plan. We're gonna slip out of here.</p>
<p>We're gonna hit an A.T.M.</p>
<p>We'll take out just a little bit of cash.</p>
<p>Just a little.</p>
<p>Just enough. He won't even notice it.</p>
<p>Just enough to have a quiet night out.</p>
<p>Here's some for you!</p>
<p>Here's some for you!</p>
<p>And here's some for you!</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>It's 4:00.</p>
<p>I'm freezing and I'm sweating all at once.</p>
<p>I think I may have peed in my pants.</p>
<p>We missed our doctor's appointment.</p>
<p>Well, only by an hour.</p>
<p>If we hurry, maybe they'll still see us.</p>
<p>It was yesterday.</p>
<p>We missed our appointment by an hour and a day.</p>
<p>We slept through a whole day?</p>
<p>I feel awful.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm gonna die!</p>
<p>I don't want to feel like this anymore, Deandra.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. Me either.</p>
<p>Okay, listen.</p>
<p>Maybe if I make a phone call right now... we'll be able to make another appointment.</p>
<p>You think he'll see us on such short notice?</p>
<p>We have gotta try.</p>
<p>Hey, man. Thanks for seeing us on such short notice.</p>
<p>That's what I do, baby.</p>
<p>Two more, please.</p>
<p>That guy. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, these are old, and I need to get new head shots.</p>
<p>Because you can't have an... an agent without head shots.</p>
<p>Dennis, when you become a veterinarian, will you buy me some new head shots?</p>
<p>Please? Dennis?</p>
<p>Hey! Dennis! Hey, Dennis.</p>
<p>Wha... What?</p>
<p>When you become a veterinarian, will you buy me head shots, please?</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, get out of here, you piece of shit!</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll buy you stuff.</p>
<p>I'll buy you lots of things.</p>
<p><em>I'm definitely gonna buy a bunch of crack.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Hey! Hey, that's Dennis and Dee!</p>
<p>Driver, pull over!</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis! Dee!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Guys. Hey.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, how's it going?</p>
<p>Good. Real good.</p>
<p>It's good on our end here.</p>
<p>We're putting a couple things together lately.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, are you guys holding?</p>
<p>Holding what?</p>
<p>Holding... Do you have any money?</p>
<p>Please?</p>
<p>Oh, um...</p>
<p>I just need a little bit of money. Wait!</p>
<p>Charlie, wait!</p>
<p><em>Charlie, wait!</p>
<p>No!</em></p>
<p>Driver, we're done here.</p>
<p>That's enough whining, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>I think it might be broken.</p>
<p>I told you not to act like such a nancy boy out there.</p>
<p>Something was bound to happen.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was full contact.</p>
<p>Well, how do you expect to become a better player if nobody pushes you?</p>
<p>Maria, go get us some ice and three beers.</p>
<p>I don't drink.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>You don't drink? Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>You two are a couple of downers, huh?</p>
<p>You work hard, you don't drink...</p>
<p>How'd you end up on welfare?</p>
<p>Well, it's a vicious cycle, Mr. Frank.</p>
<p><em>One cannot support a family on a minimum-wage position.</em></p>
<p>Oh, shh-shh-shh-shh!</p>
<p>Y'ello?</p>
<p>This is Pam from First National Bank.</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>Hi. I'd like to speak with you about some recent activity on your new account.</p>
<p>Some recent activity on my new account?</p>
<p>We got a big problem here, buddy.</p>
<p>All right. Try it again.</p>
<p>I've tried it three times.</p>
<p>It's just not working.</p>
<p>The services have already been rendered.</p>
<p>We gotta pay these girls.</p>
<p>He cut us off.</p>
<p>Is there a problem?</p>
<p>No. Not a problem here.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>I'm calling Hector.</p>
<p>No, no. Don't call Hector.</p>
<p>I'm calling Wallace.</p>
<p>We shouldn't be calling Hector or Wallace... or any other large pimp.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Charlie and I are gonna handle this situation just like we handle every situation.</p>
<p>We are gonna...</p>
<p>Well, you know, we'll just go back to work for a little while.</p>
<p>Just for a little while until we have enough money to buy some more crack.</p>
<p>Then we'll go on welfare, and I'll go be a star.</p>
<p>Then I can be a veterinarian of some kind.</p>
<p>Maybe we should think about rehab.</p>
<p>We should hit rehab as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Pretty soon.</p>
<p>In a couple days.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not now.</p>
<p><em>Ahh, Jesus Christ! That was close.</p>
<p>Ohh, look who it is!</em></p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>We're getting our jobs back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can't have em!</p>
<p>We might have a little bit of a drug problem.</p>
<p>I might not really care.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Your positions have been filled.</p>
<p>So we're gonna take yours.</p>
<p>You're not gonna take our jobs.</p>
<p>My dad called and said that we could have your jobs.</p>
<p>We need money to pay our hooker, okay?</p>
<p>So you can't have 'em.</p>
<p>But we need money to buy crack.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. Did you get addicted to crack?</p>
<p>Did somebody get addicted to crack?</p>
<p>I sweat uncontrollably!</p>
<p>I can't get somebody to have sex with me unless I pay for it!</p>
<p>Children, children.</p>
<p>... with me.</p>
<p>What's all the fighting about?</p>
<p>Did you tell them that they could have our jobs?</p>
<p>Why don't we go on inside where it's nice and warm and we can settle this like a family?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about the slaves?</p>
<p>Slaves are gone. They were bringing me down.</p>
<p>Plus, you know they don't drink?</p>
<p>Drink? I want a drink.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>Stop a second. There are gonna be some changes made.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right? First of all, you two from now on are gonna do all of Charlie's work.</p>
<p><em>I hate Charlie's work.</p>
<p>No. Not his.</em></p>
<p>Stop! Charlie, you got a lot of balls stealing my money.</p>
<p>This shows leadership.</p>
<p>I am promoting you to management.</p>
<p>That's why I did it.</p>
<p>That's fantastic!</p>
<p>That's why I did it too.</p>
<p>I stole lots of your money. What do I get?</p>
<p>You get dick, because you are a follower and a thief.</p>
<p><em>But how come Charlie?</p>
<p>Not fair. How come Charlie?</em></p>
<p>Why would you do this to us, Dad?</p>
<p>Because you are crackheads, children.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
