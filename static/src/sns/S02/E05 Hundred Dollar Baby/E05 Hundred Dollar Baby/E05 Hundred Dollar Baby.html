<p><em>I think what Mac's trying to say... is that it's probably the greatest movie of all time.</p>
<p>That's 'cause it is.</p>
<p>Rocky IV is not the greatest movie of all time.</em></p>
<p>Dee, what do you consider to be a good movie?</p>
<p><em>I don't know, like, Million Dollar Baby...</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</em></p>
<p>Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Come on. It won an Oscar.</p>
<p><em>Rocky IV has Stallone in it...</em> and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.</p>
<p>Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow.</p>
<p><em>Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.</em></p>
<p>Girls can't fight. They don't have muscles.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say.</p>
<p>It's not sexist.</p>
<p>It's just truthful.</p>
<p>Girls can't pull trucks through snow.</p>
<p>Can you pull trucks through snow?</p>
<p>I absolutely could.</p>
<p>You can barely walk in the snow.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Time out. Is the truck parked in neutral?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>What, dude?</p>
<p>Empty your pockets.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, let's just all stay calm.</p>
<p>Nice friends.</p>
<p><em>Maybe... one to two inches of snow?</em></p>
<p>One to two inches...</p>
<p>And a Ford F-150.</p>
<p>Right. In park, but no emergency brake.</p>
<p>Maybe I could pull it four feet.</p>
<p>I'd give him four feet.</p>
<p>I'd give him five. What's with the gym bag?</p>
<p>Just got back from a "Boxercise" class at the gym.</p>
<p>"Boxercise"? What kind of queer shit is that?</p>
<p>I'm learning self-defense.</p>
<p>You wanna learn self-defense, you come to Daddy.</p>
<p>I mean, all during the '60s, before I met my whore wife, I was a boxer.</p>
<p>They called me Frankie Fast Hands.</p>
<p>Frankie Fast Hands, everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah, keep livin' in the past, Dad.</p>
<p><em>Is this about that stupid Million Dollar Baby movie, Dee?</em></p>
<p>No, actually, Mac, it's about being left with a mugger... because my chickenshit brother and his friends ditched me.</p>
<p>You ditched your sister?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>With a mugger...</p>
<p>The guy had a knife.</p>
<p>Of course we did.</p>
<p>What were we supposed to do?</p>
<p>If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique.</p>
<p>Technique don't mean shit out on the streets. Guys have knives.</p>
<p>Yeah. In boxing, there are rules.</p>
<p>On the streets, we ain't got no rules.</p>
<p>Ain't no rules out on the streets.</p>
<p><em>You guys got no rules on the streets, you.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</em></p>
<p>Will you stop talking about the streets... you three jackasses, like you've been there?</p>
<p>I mean, any underground street fight in Philadelphia, you'd find tons of technique.</p>
<p>You think you could teach me?</p>
<p>In a month I'll have you kicking all their asses.</p>
<p><em>Right. See you then.</em></p>
<p>Dennis, I have an idea.</p>
<p>Well, this is awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah. This is amazing.</p>
<p>There's blood everywhere. It's beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we were totally right.</p>
<p>These guys don't have technique.</p>
<p>They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other.</p>
<p><em>Look at all this money being thrown around.</em></p>
<p>Dude, we gotta get in on this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Get up!</em></p>
<p>You know who can take a really good beating?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Here she is... The old gym.</p>
<p>Smell that?</p>
<p>That's the smell of hard work.</p>
<p>And feet.</p>
<p>That's the smell of big dreams.</p>
<p>The smell of glory.</p>
<p>It smells like feet.</p>
<p>And feet. Does smell like feet.</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Frankie Fast Hands!</p>
<p>Holy crap. I knew it was you.</p>
<p>I haven't seen you in years.</p>
<p>Hey-Hey-Hey, Frankie, it's me.</p>
<p>Bobby Thunderson.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes, Bobby.</p>
<p>Look at you!</p>
<p>You... really let yourself go.</p>
<p>Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form?</p>
<p>No, I'm actually, uh, teaching my daughter some self-defense.</p>
<p><em>Holy... Holy shit, man.</p>
<p>I'm training my daughter too.</em></p>
<p>Hey, what do you know? Hey, look at her.</p>
<p>Look at her over there.</p>
<p><em>Look, look, look. Oh!</p>
<p>Amazing. Hey, she's pretty too, huh?</em></p>
<p>Like her old man, huh?</p>
<p>Well, it's really nice seeing you, Bob.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you.</p>
<p>You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes.</p>
<p>Ass... hole.</p>
<p>Yeah, asshole.</p>
<p>Okay, don't listen to anything he says.</p>
<p>He's a real creep.</p>
<p>All right, now. Here, we're gonna start weight training.</p>
<p>First things first... Squats.</p>
<p>Okay. That's it.</p>
<p>Uh, that looks really heavy.</p>
<p>Look. This is not gonna be a half-assed workout.</p>
<p>We gotta really get into it.</p>
<p>It's gonna hurt.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I can't lift that.</p>
<p>Just position yourself under the bar and listen to me.</p>
<p>Here's what you're gonna do.</p>
<p>You're gonna take all the weight on your neck.</p>
<p>Then you're gonna jam your legs down and hyperextend your ankles... and then shoot back up and lock your knees in place.</p>
<p>Not one of those things sounds right to me at all.</p>
<p>Look. You wanna fight like a man?</p>
<p>You gotta train like a man.</p>
<p>Now, come on. Gimme a squat.</p>
<p>Ready. Go!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Go. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Daddy, I can't.</p>
<p>It's... I can't.</p>
<p>Keep it up. Keep it up.</p>
<p>At least I got the one. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Get out, get out, get out.</p>
<p>We got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><em>Good, good.</em></p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>So nobody can kick your ass, right?</p>
<p>Practically invincible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, what's your point though?</p>
<p>Well... So here's what's gonna happen, pal.</p>
<p>Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.</p>
<p>What? That is brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Okay, what's the first step?</p>
<p>First step is getting that shirt off.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's get that shirt off.</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna wear it.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>You can't train and wear a shirt, dude.</p>
<p>Now it's becoming this whole big thing. It feels a little gay.</p>
<p>It's not gay. Just take your shirt off.</p>
<p>It's not gay.</p>
<p>Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?</p>
<p>Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?</p>
<p>Just drop it for now.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe you should punch something.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should punch something...</p>
<p>Why don't you punch this board?</p>
<p>Okay. Hold it steady for me.</p>
<p>Watch your eyes.</p>
<p>All right, come on.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p><em>Oh, that's...</em></p>
<p>That looks like it stings.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What's that made out of?</p>
<p>It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood.</p>
<p>It's, like, particle board.</p>
<p>It's, like, harder than wood, dude.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's actually softer than wood.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood.</p>
<p>Petrified wood.</p>
<p>What happened, man? I thought you were...</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I wasn't drunk enough.</p>
<p>You should be drunk for this.</p>
<p>We should all be drunk for this.</p>
<p>Let's get really drunk.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what? I'll get some beers.</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Let him go.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened.</p>
<p>Mmm. Mmm.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Deandra, we've been at this for days now.</p>
<p>It's like you have no motor skills.</p>
<p>Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.</p>
<p><em>Hey! How's the chip off the old block doin'?</em></p>
<p>Bobby, not now, okay?</p>
<p>Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?</p>
<p>They billed it as "Beauty Versus the Beast."</p>
<p>Wasn't much of a fight.</p>
<p>First-round knockout.</p>
<p>He went down like a...</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?</p>
<p>What, are you trying to humiliate me?</p>
<p>Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago.</p>
<p>You know damn well you hit me after the bell.</p>
<p>That was a cheap shot.</p>
<p>What are you... You know, excuses are like assholes.</p>
<p>Everybody's got one, and they all stink.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? You wanna go at it right now?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>You wanna settle this now?</p>
<p>Let's do it right here.</p>
<p>Let's settle this son of a bitch right here.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Take it easy here.</p>
<p>Jesus. Show a little class, will ya?</p>
<p>Geez. Look, I'm an old man.</p>
<p>I don't fight no more.</p>
<p>I let my daughter do my fighting for me.</p>
<p>And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker... might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see.</p>
<p>Wait. You know what, asshole?</p>
<p>Why don't you go to hell?</p>
<p>Dee, stay out of this.</p>
<p>No. This guy has been all over us since we walked in.</p>
<p>I tell you what, jerk.</p>
<p>Why don't you take you big mouth... and go someplace else with it?</p>
<p>Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls.</p>
<p>You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Are you standing there?</p>
<p>Come on, move.</p>
<p>That guy is such an asshole.</p>
<p>Don't blame it on him.</p>
<p>You're not makin' any progress.</p>
<p>I'm goin' to get the jump rope.</p>
<p>Men are such pricks.</p>
<p>Oh, tell me about it.</p>
<p>I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around.</p>
<p>Oh, God, you have no idea.</p>
<p>If only there was a way that you could be... physically tough enough to intimidate men.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Do I know you?</p>
<p>Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place.</p>
<p>Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk.</p>
<p><em>Yeah?</p>
<p>Mac and Dennis, dude. Open the door.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's Mac and Dennis. Open the door.</p>
<p>Open the door, bro.</em></p>
<p>All right, guys.</p>
<p>Hang on a second. It's like, uh...</p>
<p>It's like 11:00 in the morning here.</p>
<p><em>We don't care. Open the door.</p>
<p>Surprise, bitch.</em></p>
<p>You're hittin' me with that?</p>
<p>Charlie, let's be honest.</p>
<p>Punching boards isn't your thing.</p>
<p>But that's okay.</p>
<p>Yes, that's okay, because for you... it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment... it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you.</p>
<p>We need to smash things all over your body.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><em>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</em></p>
<p>We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.</p>
<p>Hence the smashing.</p>
<p>We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair.</p>
<p>I think he's ready.</p>
<p>That's way too excessive at this point.</p>
<p>That guy's ready.</p>
<p>He's not ready for a chair.</p>
<p>I'm tellin' you, he's ready.</p>
<p>Hey! Guys! I can handle a chair.</p>
<p>Go get a chair.</p>
<p><em>See what you're doing to him?</p>
<p>You're getting him all worked up.</em></p>
<p>He's the toughest guy we know.</p>
<p>Yes, he is, but he...</p>
<p>Hey, Mac! Get a chair, smash it on my back.</p>
<p>That's the right attitude.</p>
<p>He's got the right attitude.</p>
<p><em>I'll tell you what. Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts.</em></p>
<p>Let's take things to the next level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But first things first. Let's get good and drunk.</p>
<p>Let's get drunk!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoo!</p>
<p>Drink this. Drink this.</p>
<p><em>Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right?</em></p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>These are performance-enhancing supplements.</p>
<p>Okay, so how long before I start to notice something?</p>
<p>This is the good stuff.</p>
<p>You'll feel it almost immediately.</p>
<p>But I should warn you, you may experience some mood swings... some irrational thinking here and there... but it is nothing compared to the long-term effects.</p>
<p>Which are what?</p>
<p>You ever punched a guy so hard in the eye he swallowed it?</p>
<p>I'll get some water.</p>
<p>How you feel, man? You drunk?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm pretty wasted.</p>
<p>Great. So what do we smash first?</p>
<p>I wanna smash a crate.</p>
<p>Yeah, a crate on his back.</p>
<p>Why don't you punch me?</p>
<p>Punch you? Punch you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm probably gonna get punched a lot in the tournament, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>Okay, that's a good point.</p>
<p>Let's punch him.</p>
<p>Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Every time I'm gonna take...</p>
<p>Why can't you just take it off?</p>
<p>Just take it off.</p>
<p>You're ruining the moment.</p>
<p>What is with you and the moment?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Forget it. Forget it.</p>
<p>Who do you want to punch you first?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>Well, you caught me off guard.</p>
<p>That was a big part of it.</p>
<p><em>That was the same spot. The same, exact spot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Deandra.</p>
<p>Just 10 more minutes.</p>
<p>No, no. That's it. Dee, that's...</p>
<p>I love it. I need more of it.</p>
<p>It's dangerous.</p>
<p>Enough. Enough.</p>
<p>Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?</p>
<p>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>You think I can't do this by myself?</p>
<p>You think I'm on something?</p>
<p>"On something"?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I never said you were on something.</p>
<p>Then don't. Don't start.</p>
<p>Hey, now we're talkin' here.</p>
<p>She's a killer.</p>
<p>You're goddamn right I'm a killer.</p>
<p>You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.</p>
<p>I will eat your babies, bitch.</p>
<p>Bring it!</p>
<p>Nobody's eating babies.</p>
<p>Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?</p>
<p>No. No fight. She's not ready.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm ready.</p>
<p>No, you're not ready.</p>
<p>I'm ready! Let me eat her babies.</p>
<p>What about next Friday, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. How's Friday?</p>
<p>You're crazy.</p>
<p>How's Friday to you?</p>
<p>What's the matter, "Frankie Fat Hands"?</p>
<p>You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Get this lion off of me here.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No! You stop it. This is my fight.</p>
<p>Do you understand me?</p>
<p>I'm sick of men getting in my way.</p>
<p>This is my fight. You hear me?</p>
<p>You hear what I'm saying?</p>
<p>Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh?</p>
<p><em>Okay. We'll see you next Friday, huh?</em></p>
<p>"Beauty Versus the Beast II."</p>
<p>Come on, Brianna. Here we go.</p>
<p>You're not ready for this fight.</p>
<p>Oh, I have an idea, Dad.</p>
<p>Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag?</p>
<p>I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.</p>
<p>Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right?</p>
<p>I'm trying to find my goddamn headband. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there?</p>
<p>Is that all right with you, Dad? Jesus!</p>
<p>Why didn't we get the orange one like I said?</p>
<p>This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged!</p>
<p>Oh, good. Are you happy now?</p>
<p>I just punched a hole in my wall!</p>
<p>Are you sure you're okay, dude?</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>I start thinking, you know, and it makes...</p>
<p>It makes me so angry.</p>
<p>What am I saying?</p>
<p>Okay. Were gonna go...</p>
<p>We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>And you stay here and eat your eggs.</p>
<p>Have the... Have... Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?</p>
<p>Can you meet us later?</em></p>
<p>Meet you later?</p>
<p>Can I meet you later?</p>
<p>Are you gonna meet us?</p>
<p>Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, sign here, here and here.</p>
<p>And what is this?</p>
<p>These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.</p>
<p>Oh, we don't care about that.</p>
<p>Sign away.</p>
<p>What's the, uh, fighter's name?</p>
<p>Clown Baby.</p>
<p>Clown Ba... Clown Baby?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mean like a baby clown?</p>
<p>Not a baby clown. A clown ba...</p>
<p>It's like a baby...</p>
<p>It's like a clown that is a baby.</p>
<p>I said cl... clown baby.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. You said baby clown.</p>
<p>I don't even care.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>"Clown Baby"? What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?</p>
<p>Bro, it's perfect. Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.</p>
<p>He's gonna be a huge underdog.</p>
<p>Which means we stand to make even more money off him.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, that's brilliant.</p>
<p>Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby.</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis. 500?</p>
<p>That's all we got, dude.</p>
<p>You saw Charlie.</p>
<p>We turned that kid into an animal.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Call me a Holocaust victim?</p>
<p>Say you're prettier than me?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true.</p>
<p>We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...</p>
<p>Wha...</p>
<p>Where the he...</p>
<p>Who took my shit?</p>
<p>I might have had some.</p>
<p>What did you just say, you little bitch?</p>
<p>I might have had some of your pills or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>I am gonna punch a hole through your face.</p>
<p>I'd like to see you try that.</p>
<p><em>Yeah?</em></p>
<p>Ooh, you're gonna die!</p>
<p>Oh, I am gonna rip your face off...</p>
<p>You're gonna die!</p>
<p>Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die!</p>
<p><em>What the... Hey, listen, lady.</em></p>
<p>You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else.</p>
<p>Watch the car.</p>
<p>Dude, where the hell is your fighter?</p>
<p>He'll be here.</p>
<p>He'll be here when?</p>
<p>Soon!</p>
<p>Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with Charlie.</p>
<p>Well, where is he?</p>
<p>He's in jail with Dee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines... and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.</p>
<p>Amphetamines?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, steroids or something. I don't know.</p>
<p>Damn it, Charlie.</p>
<p>Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.</p>
<p>He's the scrawniest...</p>
<p>I know! Charlie would have killed that guy.</p>
<p>We're gonna miss out on all this money.</p>
<p>Anybody could kick that guy's ass.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Come on. You could kick...</p>
<p>You-You could kick that guy's ass.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you're, like, the second toughest guy I know.</p>
<p>I did bash Charlie good a couple times.</p>
<p>You almost hurt him once.</p>
<p>With the bottle?</p>
<p>Yeah, and that's next to impossible.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>You're... You're good.</p>
<p>I am good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tell you what. Um...</p>
<p>Why don't you go stretch out.</p>
<p>I'll talk to the bookie and let him know that Clown Baby... has arrived.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Frankie, what's the deal?</p>
<p>She got arrested.</p>
<p>Ah! I knew that skinny bitch would chicken out.</p>
<p>So we'll never get the fight.</p>
<p>That's a shame, Frankie.</p>
<p>Lot of unanswered questions.</p>
<p>You want your fight? You got your fight.</p>
<p>You and me, right now.</p>
<p>Well, I... No.</p>
<p>What? Daddy, you can beat him. Come on.</p>
<p>You're next.</p>
<p>It'll be like the old days. I will kill you.</p>
<p>I will knock your nose off your face.</p>
<p>You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>All right, you got a fight.</p>
<p>Greg, get my gloves.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back.</p>
<p>He was so fast.</p>
<p>You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.</p>
<p>We have nothing.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>I gave it my best.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what? Your best wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>Hey, you have the time?</p>
<p>Aw, not you again.</p>
<p>We don't have any money.</p>
<p>We just lost it all.</p>
<p><em>Empty your pockets.</p>
<p>Hey, meth-head.</em></p>
<p>Are you listening to me?</p>
<p>We don't have any money.</p>
<p>Do it, or I will kill you both.</p>
<p>Okay, here you go. Look. Empty.</p>
<p>Now you.</p>
<p>I don't have anything.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>I don't have...</p>
<p>Just empty your pockets.</p>
<p>No. I'm not emptying 'em. I'm not even gonna...</p>
<p>I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.</p>
<p>It's a matter of principle.</p>
<p>A matter of principle?</p>
<p>I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head. - I'm gonna stab you, man!</p>
<p>For the love of God, empty your pockets.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Give it to me.</p>
<p>You give us a second.</p>
<p>Where did you get that money?</p>
<p>I had to change the bet... a little.</p>
<p>You bet against me?</p>
<p>I bet against you.</p>
<p>Why would you bet against me?</p>
<p>It was the right move.</p>
<p>I mean, you got your ass kicked.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't you tell me?</p>
<p>I could have taken a dive.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.</p>
<p>Mac, it had to look real.</p>
<p>Were you gonna tell me eventually?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I was going to tell you eventually.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Stab this son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Oh, wait a second.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Mac.</p>
<p>Don't be like that, man.</p>
<p>You would have done the same thing.</p>
<p>Come on, don't act like a baby.</p>
<p>Please don't stab me.</p>
<p>Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy.</p>
<p>Your last chance to chicken out.</p>
<p>That ain't gonna happen, Bobby.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for this for a long time.</p>
<p>All right, Frankie.</p>
<p>Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...</p>
<p>I think we should lay down some ground rules.</p>
<p>Now. Number one.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
