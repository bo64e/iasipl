<p><em>Come on. Just one more race.</p>
<p>Every time we race, you lose.</p>
<p>You always lose.</p>
<p>One more race, and then we'll go to the strip club.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Three, two, one.</em></p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Super slow drinker over here.</p>
<p>Do you have, like, a little throat or something?</p>
<p>Dennis. We gotta get out of here now.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I just got off the phone with Dad.</p>
<p>He wants to stop by and talk to us.</p>
<p>What does Dad want?</p>
<p>I don't know! Let's go before we have to deal with this!</p>
<p>Let's get out of here before you guys get around your father.</p>
<p>Let's just take care of one more...</p>
<p>Don't... Don't be grabby.</p>
<p>Okay. Dennis, I need to borrow $20.</p>
<p>What, dude?</p>
<p>Just give me some money, man.</p>
<p>How come you don't ever have any money?</p>
<p>Dee? Moneys?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do at the strip club with...</p>
<p>Will you just get in the car!</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>It sucks for me, 'cause you guys get all the girls and the attention!</p>
<p>My dad's gonna be here in a second!</p>
<p>Will you get in the car!</p>
<p>No! I'm going home! I'm going home.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Can we go? Please!</p>
<p>Yeah, we can go. We can go.</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><em>Dennis, no!</p>
<p>Dennis, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you, Dad?</em></p>
<p>Why would you come sneaking around the bar in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>You don't snoop and sneak and appear in front of cars and start yelling names!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>I had something very important to tell you.</p>
<p>Really? What could be so important it couldn't wait till the morning?</p>
<p>There's nothing more important than the fact that we just hit our friend with a car.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Try this on for size.</p>
<p>Your mother's dead.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>No, she's not dead.</p>
<p>We're gettin' divorced though.</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>Why...</p>
<p>What...</p>
<p>What...</p>
<p>Why would you say that she's dead?</p>
<p>That's a business tactic.</p>
<p>You drop the bomb, then you soften the blow. You never tried this?</p>
<p>That is a terrible business tactic!</p>
<p>You are a horrible father.</p>
<p>That's what I came to talk to you about.</p>
<p>I hate the kind of person that your whore mother turned me into.</p>
<p>The big house, the big car...</p>
<p>I'm giving it all away.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Giving it away how?</p>
<p>For starters, I'm giving all my money to charity.</p>
<p>Then I'm gonna hang out with you two.</p>
<p>That's what this is all about... spending time with my kids.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I wanna be the father that I never was.</p>
<p>Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>Getting to know them.</p>
<p>What did you say about the money?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I'm giving it all away.</p>
<p>That is a very stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>You're a very stupid, stupid man.</p>
<p>Who are you gonna give it to?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Poor people.</p>
<p>Poor people?</p>
<p>Poor people?</p>
<p>What... What is your prob...</p>
<p>Okay, where's Mom?</p>
<p>Mom? She's on vacation banging one of the boys she hangs out with.</p>
<p><em>Dennis, your mother is a dirty, dirty whore.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it, Dad!</em></p>
<p>First you force me to run over my friend Charlie.</p>
<p>And then you start talking about Mom like she's dead.</p>
<p>Now you're saying she's a dirty whore?</p>
<p>The money.</p>
<p>You can't waltz back into our lives and be our dad again!</p>
<p>And the money.</p>
<p>It doesn't work that way. You can't just barge in!</p>
<p>And the money!</p>
<p>And the money!</p>
<p>My God, Dad! All of our money?</p>
<p>Well, that was awkward.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>Sort of a private conversation.</p>
<p>Very much a family type moment.</p>
<p>We didn't need to hear any of that.</p>
<p><em>Not for our ears.</em></p>
<p>Wanna go to the strip club?</p>
<p><em>I don't know.</em></p>
<p>I've been manically depressed for the past couple of years.</p>
<p>I just feel like I need a serious change, or I'm gonna kill myself.</p>
<p>So when you say you're giving your money away to poor people... do you mean, like, "Mexico" poor, or can it be, like, "me and Charlie" poor?</p>
<p>Well, I haven't given that much thought.</p>
<p>Put some thought into that one.</p>
<p>Consider that.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. Give that some thought.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you wanna get shit-faced, bro. So I tell you what.</p>
<p>Before we get crazy giving away our money here... what do you say we buy a couple of pitchers... maybe a few tequila shots, a few rounds of kamikazes.</p>
<p>After that, we'll hit the town, we'll tie on a serious buzz. All right, bud?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You poor baby. What happened?</p>
<p>Uh, my best friend ran me over with his car.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! That's terrible!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you want a lap dance?</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>I don't have any money.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I could give you one for free.</p>
<p>Really? Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my God! You poor baby.</p>
<p>What happened to you?</em></p>
<p>His friend ran him over with a car.</p>
<p>That is so sad.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I was gonna give him a free lap dance.</p>
<p>She totally was.</p>
<p>I'll join you!</p>
<p>That's great! Do one of you girls wanna hook my boy up over here?</p>
<p>He's really down in the dumps.</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>No, no, no. I don't... I don't...</p>
<p>Oh, come on, buddy!</p>
<p>You gotta do this, man!</p>
<p>Embrace it. Get in the spirit.</p>
<p>This is gonna cheer you up.</p>
<p>Well, maybe just one.</p>
<p>All right, Frank! See?</p>
<p>That's the spirit that beat theJapanese!</p>
<p>God. Stupid Dad!</p>
<p>Never gave me a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><em>Give his shit to poor people. Poor people?</em></p>
<p>Ooh! Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>Dee, you scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Same thing you're doing, Dennis. I'm not letting Dad give all this shit to poor people.</p>
<p>I got here first though. I'm taking the plasma TV and the fish tank.</p>
<p>How come you get to pick and choose?</p>
<p>It's not that.</p>
<p>I'm a man and I'm strong.</p>
<p>I can carry heavy things.</p>
<p>You're a woman.</p>
<p>You're weak, and you can't.</p>
<p>You're a woman and you're weak.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>You don't make any sense.</p>
<p>Great. I'll tell you what.</p>
<p><em>Um, I'm gonna take all the stuff that I want and load it into my enormous S. U. V...</em> and you can grab some trinkets or whatever and throw it in your tiny little car.</p>
<p>All right, look.</p>
<p>We don't need to be doing this, okay?</p>
<p>You're my brother. We're...</p>
<p>We're in this thing together.</p>
<p>We don't need to make this a competition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're right. A competition.</p>
<p>That's a good idea. I'll make you a deal.</p>
<p>Whatever your feeble little arms can carry out of here, you can keep.</p>
<p>And the rest is mine.</p>
<p>God, I hate you so bad!</p>
<p>Okay, you ready?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>On your mark!</p>
<p>Get set! Go!</p>
<p>Go, go, go!</p>
<p>Go, horsey!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>No! Wait a second!</p>
<p>Charlie, you hit me!</p>
<p>You hit me, Charlie!</p>
<p>So what? So what?</p>
<p>You are fast.</p>
<p>I was winning anyway.</p>
<p>This one's too heavy!</p>
<p>This one's too heavy!</p>
<p>You are freakishly fast!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Charlie, you got any booze in here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Check under my bed or under one of my pillows.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I can't thank you enough.</p>
<p>I feel so much better.</p>
<p>So much.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. Hey, you look great.</p>
<p>Make yourself at home.</p>
<p>Charlie, we gotta get him out of here.</p>
<p>What? Why, dude?</p>
<p>Because there's two of them and three of us!</p>
<p>Have a heart.</p>
<p>The guy's going through a divorce.</p>
<p>Since when do you give a shit about people?</p>
<p>Well, you know.</p>
<p>Maybe you should be the one that leaves, okay?</p>
<p>Don't you roll away when I'm talking to you.</p>
<p>I am the reason the girls are here in the first place.</p>
<p>That is bullshit!</p>
<p>Do not ruin this! Do not ruin this for me!</p>
<p>I'm not ruining anything!</p>
<p><em>Whoa!</p>
<p>What are you guys fighting about?</em></p>
<p>Nothing, man.</p>
<p>We're just having a...</p>
<p>Well, take it out in the hall.</p>
<p>You're ruining the vibe.</p>
<p>Okay. We'll go out in the hall. Watch my... Watch my...</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Easy. Easy!</p>
<p>Your behavior is unbelievable, man.</p>
<p>All right. How are we gonna do this?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, let's flip a coin. The loser leaves.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, get a coin.</p>
<p>I don't have a coin.</p>
<p>Why don't you...</p>
<p>Give me a coin. You have a coin?</p>
<p>Of course I don't have a coin.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's flip something else.</p>
<p>All right. Um...</p>
<p>Something in the hallway, like a feather.</p>
<p>Flip that, uh, piece of wood?</p>
<p>That's not gonna work.</p>
<p>What about something off the chair?</p>
<p>Yeah. Maybe we'll just break something off the chair.</p>
<p>Break something... Don't...</p>
<p>Don't break it too much.</p>
<p>No, that's not gonna work.</p>
<p>It's a rental, dude.</p>
<p>You know what? Frank's got money. Let's ask him.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It's locked.</p>
<p>No. You gotta push it hard 'cause it sticks.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, it's locked.</p>
<p>Bang again!</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Frank, open the door, dude!</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You guys need to give me about 45 minutes in here, okay?</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, here's five dollars.</p>
<p>Go down to Wawa, pick me up a couple of sodas.</p>
<p>I got a feeling I'll be pretty thirsty after this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey...</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Over the line.</p>
<p>Over the line!</p>
<p><em>I'm... I'm on the line.</p>
<p>On the line is over the line. Get your foot on your side.</em></p>
<p>Which side? This one?</p>
<p>Is this the side?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This the side you're talking about?</p>
<p>Get... All right. You know what?</p>
<p>Oh, what is this?</p>
<p>Do you recognize this lamp?</p>
<p>Where'd you get that?</p>
<p>I think this is the lamp Dad got you in China.</p>
<p>Give it back to me.</p>
<p>As I recall, yeah.</p>
<p>Give me my lamp back.</p>
<p>Must have gotten this out of your room.</p>
<p>Well, it's mine.</p>
<p>Let me put it on your side for you.</p>
<p>You s...</p>
<p>Oh, that is a shame.</p>
<p>No, that's fine. I don't care.</p>
<p>It slipped.</p>
<p>Yeah. By the way, I wanted to show you something... my feeble little arms were able to carry.</p>
<p>By all means.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Tibbs.</p>
<p>Oh, is that it?</em></p>
<p>Is that Mr. Tib... Is that what they call you?</p>
<p>They call you Mr. Tibbs?</p>
<p>What do they call you now?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p><em>I don't care.</em></p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dennis, you would not believe how great this thing is.</p>
<p>People give you free shit, and women treat you like a puppy they found out on the street.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. Dude, I was thinking.</p>
<p>You pick up one of these bad boys, we head down to the mall.</p>
<p>There's a ton of talent down there.</p>
<p>We've been looking for a new angle.</p>
<p>That does sound like fun.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.</p>
<p><em>Oh, I'm sorry, Dee. We're putting ourselves into the shoes of the unfortunate...</em> see what their world's like, maybe gain a little perspective.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>I don't take advantage of people.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Look at Sweet Dee sitting on her cloud of judgment... handing down life lessons to all the sinners.</p>
<p>Come on, Mac.</p>
<p>Let's go get crippled.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie, buddy, buddy, buddy. Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I'm cold.</p>
<p>We gotta talk, Charlie.</p>
<p>Uh... Oh, yeah, Frank. We have to talk.</p>
<p>Last night was one of the greatest nights of my whole life.</p>
<p>I'm sure it was.</p>
<p>I used to live like this in squalor and filth... always trying to get over on people, scamming my way through situations.</p>
<p>Wow! I don't care!</p>
<p>I wanna live like you again, Charlie.</p>
<p>I wanna be pathetic and desperate and ugly and hopeless.</p>
<p>I am not ugly.</p>
<p>This is the change I've been looking for.</p>
<p>I wanna move in with you.</p>
<p>Are you out...</p>
<p>Are you out of your damn mind, dude?</p>
<p>You made me sleep out in the hall.</p>
<p>You ignored my cries for help in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I'll pay for your rent for six months.</p>
<p>Twelve.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Ten.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Nine.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Ten.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Twelve.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>Six.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>No more sleeping out in the hall though.</p>
<p>I can't promise that.</p>

<p>Let's get ready.</p>
<p>All right. Where are you taking me?</p>
<p>We're going back to the strip club.</p>
<p>All right. Strip club...</p>
<p>Dude! My legs!</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>This is going to be like shooting fish in a barrel for us.</p>
<p>It's gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>What's your backstory?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Bro, your backstory. How'd your legs get crippled?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>All right, check mine out. I had polio. Okay?</p>
<p>That's why I'm rocking the F. D. R. Look with the blanket and everything.</p>
<p>See, I got a problem.</p>
<p>My legs are really muscular and athletic.</p>
<p>So nobody's gonna believe that they're dead. Okay?</p>
<p>This way, with the blanket, everyone will assume that underneath... my legs are withered and useless.</p>
<p>Huh. That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Bro, it's brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have polio too.</p>
<p>You can't have polio. That's my disease.</p>
<p>You gotta pick your own disease.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I want polio.</p>
<p>Well, you can't have it.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>Are you sure you're okay?</p>
<p>It's really important that I do this myself.</p>
<p>You are so brave.</p>
<p>I got it!</p>
<p>All by myself, I did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did.</p>
<p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do now? We can't go back in there. Everybody's desensitized.</p>
<p>All right, look.</p>
<p>We'll go down to Crate and Barrel.</p>
<p>Maybe we can find some cougars or something.</p>
<p>Hey, guys!</p>
<p>shit! What do we do?</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>Uh, okay. Just play it cool, man.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>Play it cool.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>I have polio.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Uh... Okay.</p>
<p>And I have polio...</p>
<p>He has polio too.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>So if you wanna shower, you gotta shower in the bar.</p>
<p>Shower in the bar?</p>
<p>Yeah. Shower in the sink.</p>
<p>In the sink?</p>
<p>Yeah. You never showered in a sink bef...</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Do you see that?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I got a good idea. I think I know how we can really up our game at the strip club.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Who gets more respect and admiration in this country than war heroes?</p>
<p>Athletes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>But after that.</p>
<p>Rock stars.</p>
<p>Yeah, also true. But after that, Frank.</p>
<p>Actors.</p>
<p>Yeah... Right.</p>
<p>Models.</p>
<p>Yes. Look...</p>
<p>Rich people.</p>
<p>Okay, look, look, look!</p>
<p>If you just buy me this costume...</p>
<p>I'm gonna show these ladies a war hero they can't take their eyes off of.</p>
<p>I don't think this costume's gonna work.</p>
<p>No, this costume...</p>
<p>The chicks are gonna go crazy over this.</p>
<p><em>Maybe you should let me do all the talking.</em></p>
<p>It's gonna be like fish in a barrel. I got it covered.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just watch... watch and learn.</p>
<p>Oh, look at you, sweetie.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Viet-goddamn-nam's what happened!</p>
<p>Go get me a beer, bitch!</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>What are you doing? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Hey, that was working.</p>
<p>Let me do the talking.</p>
<p>I'll take it from here.</p>
<p>Did you just box me in?</p>
<p>You don't do that to a guy, Frank.</p>
<p>You don't box in a vet!</p>
<p><em>You don't stick a vet in the corner, Frank!</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</em></p>
<p>He's a little loosey-goosey upstairs.</p>
<p>I try to get him out as much as possible.</p>
<p>It's very difficult.</p>
<p>Is he your...</p>
<p>Boy. He's my poor little crippled boy.</p>
<p>Oh, that's so sad.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>I didn't fight no damn war so I could be boxed in... by some square commie-ass piece of shit!</p>
<p>Well, I feel awful.</p>
<p>Well, that's what happens when you meet an actual crippled person.</p>
<p>Brings you down.</p>
<p>Yeah, disabled.</p>
<p>Whatever, dude.</p>
<p>Crippled, disabled... I don't care, man!</p>
<p>I just wanna get out of here. This whole thing's ruined.</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>We should, because, you know, you weren't pulling it off anyway.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Don't pull that shit with me, okay?</p>
<p>I didn't ruin this. You ruined this.</p>
<p>How did I ruin it?</p>
<p>I had a good polio backstory that the chicks were gonna totally dig...</p>
<p>Nobody cares about polio or backstories or...</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I bet you a million dollars if I had talked to a girl...</p>
<p>For God's sakes!</p>
<p>About my withered legs, then...</p>
<p>A million dollars?</p>
<p>All right. What are we doing?</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>I think that there's only one true way to settle this like gentlemen.</p>
<p>You're dead!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, baby!</p>
<p>You cheated! You cheated!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>You suck!</p>
<p>All you do is cheat!</p>
<p>How do you feel about that, huh?</p>
<p>How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You're just a sore loser!</p>
<p>What's going on down there?</p>
<p>Those two guys are pretending to be disabled and kicking each other's asses.</p>
<p>What a bunch of scumbags.</p>
<p>Being handicapped sucks, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, man. It's too much work.</p>
<p>There's, like, nothing to show for it, man.</p>
<p>There's no advantages.</p>
<p>Oh, look at this guy. Hey.</p>
<p>Another homeless guy?</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Hey, pal, wake up.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>What time is it?</p>
<p>Why are you dressed like that, dude?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Why are you sleeping out here?</p>
<p>Because I can't sleep in there!</p>
<p>I can't get onto the stupid curb!</p>
<p>Why would you wanna sleep in there?</p>
<p>Your dad keeps swooping in, taking my chicks... and locking me out of my apartment!</p>
<p>Okay. Well, we were gonna go inside and get drunk. You wanna come with us?</p>
<p>No. Look at me.</p>
<p>I got a whole thing going on, man.</p>
<p>What... Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm going to the strip... Don't touch that.</p>
<p>I'm going to the strip club. I'm gonna get some girls...</p>
<p>With this?</p>
<p>I mean... Yeah, with this! I mean, the whole thing is... This is good as gold.</p>
<p>Frank keeps coming in.</p>
<p>He swoops in, he takes my chicks.</p>
<p>He doesn't care about me.</p>
<p>What kind of a guy does that?</p>
<p>Who comes into someone's apartment and just kicks him out?</p>
<p>Like I'm a piece of crap.</p>
<p>Like I belong on the street.</p>
<p>Like I'm some kind of piece of dirt.</p>
<p>That's bullshit, man!</p>
<p>War hero coming through.</p>
<p>How you doing? War hero.</p>
<p>So... kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>I'm a war hero. How do you...</p>
<p>Hey, how you doin'?</p>
<p>I'm a war hero.</p>
<p>So I'll catch up with you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>Hey, war hero.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>All right. All right. Maybe hit the gym a little bit. What the hell?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Hey, this is my roommate, Charlie.</p>
<p><em>Girls, say hello to Charlie.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Hi, Charlie!</p>
<p>No! No!</em></p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>No, Frank!</p>
<p>Come here! Come here!</p>
<p>What... What is this shit?</p>
<p>Well, it's just...</p>
<p>I rigged it up.</p>
<p>It's like...</p>
<p>I'm really using my hands, but they don't know it.</p>
<p>No, Frank! What are you doing with the strippers? You're stealing my thing!</p>
<p>What? Well, I figured, you know, I'd cut out the middleman.</p>
<p>This way, everybody wins.</p>
<p>I don't win.</p>
<p>The other thing I figured out is the only thing... that attracts the attention of strippers more than pity is money.</p>
<p>And I brought a shitload of that.</p>
<p>What... Charlie!</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill you!</p>
<p>You're totally blowing up my scene here, man!</p>
<p>Are you crazy?</p>
<p>This is the best thing that ever happened to me, and you're ruining it!</p>
<p>It's a win-win situation.</p>
<p>No! You come to my apartment! You lock me out!</p>
<p>Take all my girls!</p>
<p>It's not a win-win situation!</p>
<p>My thumb's on your neck.</p>
<p>Why can't you just give me this?</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill you.</p>
<p>This guy's a walker!</p>
<p>But I love the guy, all right?</p>
<p>He's family, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, we've been through a lot together.</p>
<p>Okay? So, you know, is it wrong for me to love him? I don't know.</p>
<p>If I have to listen to you talk about this stupid... goddamned stuffed elephant anymore...</p>
<p>I'm going to punch you in the head.</p>
<p>Hey! Mr. Tibbs was not just some stupid stuffed element... elephant, okay?</p>
<p>He was like a companion.</p>
<p>Strip club!</p>
<p>All right. Let's go...</p>
<p>Strip club!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go to the strip club.</p>
<p>You're driving.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You know, I didn't realize that somebody in your condition could have so much energy.</p>
<p>Well, you gotta live, right?</p>
<p>God!</p>
<p>You know, you... you are an amazing person.</p>
<p>I'm scoring in there, and you come in there and blow everything!</p>
<p>You shouldn't even be in there!</p>
<p>You get your hands off my blow tube!</p>
<p><em>Go get your goddamn car and give me a ride home!</em></p>
<p>I'll give you a ride home!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Ow, my legs!</p>
<p>Oh, my legs!</p>
<p>Frank, what are you doing?</p>
<p><em>Hey, Dad!</p>
<p>My broken legs!</em></p>
<p>Why are you beating up a homeless person?</p>
<p>What the hell's with the crutches?</p>
<p>It's kind of a...</p>
<p>It's kind of a long story.</p>
<p><em>I can't really go into it right now.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</em></p>
<p>Whether you like it or not... Here! How about that?</p>
<p>Hey! Give...</p>
<p>Whoo! That's right!</p>
<p>We're going to the strip club!</p>
<p>I'm gonna steal Charlie's girls at the strip club!</p>
<p>I'm gonna buy you a lap dance.</p>
<p>I'm gonna buy myself a lap dance.</p>
<p>I'm gonna buy everybody at the whole strip club a lap dance.</p>
<p>Whoa! Are you people all pretending to be handicapped?</p>
<p>Mind your own business.</p>
<p>Give me the crutches back. Dad!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Who's acting like a child? You just stole my stuff!</p>
<p>You are acting like a child!</p>
<p>Oh! Whoo!</p>

<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p><em>Paging Dr. Lyon.</p>
<p>Dr. Lyon, please report to the emergency room.</em></p>
<p>We are so lucky that nobody got killed.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, Dennis is lucky that nobody got killed... since he's the guy that just about killed everybody.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe you killed somebody.</p>
<p>How does that make sense?</p>
<p>Maybe you did kill somebody!</p>
<p>Maybe you standing in front of a driving car...</p>
<p>Yeah, well, driving a vehicle...</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Will you shut up, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Don't youse ever stop fighting and just shut the hell up?</p>
