<p><em>Well, then what would you say?</p>
<p>She's a quitter.</p>
<p>You know what? I don't even care!</em></p>
<p>And that proves my point.</p>
<p>Because you don't care, you never succeed.</p>
<p>Right. Failed.</p>
<p>Failure implies that she actually tried to be an actor.</p>
<p>Okay, I did try.</p>
<p>It just didn't happen to work out.</p>
<p>It's not your fault, sweetie.</p>
<p>You're just not pretty enough.</p>
<p><em>Oh, thank you! That's my dad, everybody!</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Okay, I just killed three very large rats...</em> that were stuck in glue traps.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>No, no, that's not good.</p>
<p>I am done with rat detail.</p>
<p>That's by far the worst job in the bar!</p>
<p>That's why we call it "Charlie work."</p>
<p>No, dude. Not Charlie work.</p>
<p>There's an emotional toll that comes out of this. I mean, you kill one of those...</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>You're blowing smoke directly in my face when I'm trying to talk to you.</p>
<p>What is he talking about?</p>
<p>If you want to smoke, you should have to take it outside.</p>
<p>That's it. I'm done with this.</p>
<p>It's a bar.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's a bar, dude.</p>
<p>Charlie, I think you're right.</p>
<p>I think maybe we should ban smoking in here.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>That's completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>How is that ridiculous?</p>
<p>There are smoking bans in a lot of states now.</p>
<p>Uh, yes. And it's completely un-American.</p>
<p>If you don't like smoke, then don't come into the bar.</p>
<p>I work in this bar.</p>
<p>I work here.</p>
<p>But that's because you have the freedom to choose to work here.</p>
<p>Smoking bans, they don't protect freedom.</p>
<p>They strip 'em away from smokers.</p>
<p><em>Look, I didn't go to Vietnam...</em> just to have pansies like you take my freedom away from me.</p>
<p>You went to Vietnam in 1993 to open up a sweatshop!</p>
<p>And a lot of good men died in that sweatshop!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! You're out of your mind.</p>
<p>Look, look.</p>
<p>The point is that if Charlie took any time to study in school... he would recognize that the Constitution protects my freedom to blow smoke all over his face.</p>
<p>You gotta be... You don't know shit about the Constitution, man.</p>
<p>He knows more than you two un-American freedom haters. - Thank you.</p>
<p>Charlie, we hate freedom. Ew, we hate it.</p>
<p>Hate it.</p>
<p>I'm un-American?</p>
<p>You're practically a Vietcong.</p>
<p>Oh, is that right?</p>
<p>Okay, you wanna talk America?</p>
<p>You wanna learn a little something about America? Dee, let's roll out of here.</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>We're gonna go America all over their asses!</p>
<p><em>It is time for the truth!</em></p>
<p>Five million people will die this year of smoking-related illnesses!</p>
<p>These body bags, these represent the number of people...</p>
<p><em>that will die in this city alone today!</em></p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way!</p>
<p>Let's make smoking history!</p>
<p><em>Yeah!</em></p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah! Yeah, man!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>U.S.A., baby! Whoo!</p>
<p>That's what America's all about, Dee!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right here! This is the U.S. A!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>That guy really knew how to pull an audience.</p>
<p>I tell you what.</p>
<p>Let's get in on this.</p>
<p>Hey, bro. Great job out there, man.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>You really... You had me like hook, line and sinker with that...</p>
<p>It was awesome, dude. It was awesome.</p>
<p>So, look, I want in on the cause.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Just go to the Web site and you can check out...</p>
<p>No, I don't want to do that. I wanna be on the front lines like you, bro.</p>
<p>I wanna be, like, you know, join the team or something.</p>
<p>Naw, it's really complicated.</p>
<p>There's a lot of red tape. You really can't...</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>But just what in the hell do you think you're doing?</p>
<p>Oh, dude.</p>
<p>This is just an acting gig.</p>
<p>Like, I'm not really part of any cause.</p>
<p>Oh, you're an actor?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oh. But not a real one?</p>
<p>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>No, just... I mean, you're on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Oh, right. Like you know what you're talking about. How old are you? Like, 40?</p>
<p><em>I live in New York, okay?</em></p>
<p>Street theater is the only organized artistic expression that we have...</p>
<p>What a crock of shit, man!</p>
<p>You're living a lie, bro!</p>
<p>Dude, relax.</p>
<p>Oh, relax? Oh, I'm gonna...</p>
<p>You're gonna throw with me? Little actor boy, you wanna throw with a patriot?</p>
<p><em>Back off! Back off!</p>
<p>I'm not 40.</em></p>
<p>I don't need this.</p>
<p>Get in your van. Get in your van and go, okay?</p>
<p>'Cause I'll throw down!</p>
<p>I'll throw down any day of the week!</p>
<p>Get in your little van and drive out of my face! Okay?</p>
<p>Before I go America all over your ass!</p>
<p><em>You know what?</p>
<p>Screw Dee and Charlie.</em></p>
<p>I'm sick of people telling us what we can and can't do with our own bar, you know?</p>
<p>What happened to this country?</p>
<p>Why can't we stay open past 2:00 a. M?</p>
<p>Yes! And why can't we sell booze before noon on Sunday?</p>
<p>These are the kind of puritanical restrictions that are killing this country.</p>
<p>This is why people flock to places like Las Vegas... and New Orleans and spring break.</p>
<p>Because they're free to go wild.</p>
<p>The girls go wild.</p>
<p>The girls in Philly need a place to go wild.</p>
<p>Right. New Orleans was washed away in that terrible storm.</p>
<p>Tragic.</p>
<p>We need to open up Paddy's as a haven for freedom.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A replacement for the tragic loss of New Orleans.</p>
<p>We should have gambling too.</p>
<p>And we should have gambling too.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>We will open up Paddy's as the most American bar in all of America!</p>
<p>A place with absolute freedom!</p>
<p>With no gambling restrictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, whatever. Listen, dude.</p>
<p>We should head down to sorority houses, right?</p>
<p>Spread the word, you know?</p>
<p>Hand out some leaflets or something.</p>
<p>No, Mac. We should go to the library.</p>
<p>The library? Why?</p>
<p>Yeah, because at sorority houses you're gonna find nothing but tramps and whores.</p>
<p>Those girls are already wild.</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Mac, you're not listening to me.</p>
<p>We don't want wild girls.</p>
<p>We want real girls going wild.</p>
<p>It's important to see the transition.</p>
<p>You want to watch the process.</p>
<p><em>Dee, what the hell is the point of this stretching?</em></p>
<p>Charlie, if we're gonna put on our own demonstration... then your body needs to be in tip-top shape out there.</p>
<p>My body is in tip-top shape. - Well, maybe for a small, fat person. Not for an actor.</p>
<p>Fat person?</p>
<p>A chunky... chunky...</p>
<p>A chunky person? Where are you getting that?</p>
<p>A husky person.</p>
<p>Since when? Oh!</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You know what? All right, forget it.</p>
<p>I'm not an actor anyway.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, then I'm a protestor, right?</p>
<p>I'm a patriot. Give me that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That's my bag.</p>
<p>What I need from you is for you to feed me some lines.</p>
<p>I can feed you lines.</p>
<p>And then I'll go from there.</p>
<p>I just don't need all the...</p>
<p>I can take over.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>Let's focus on finding your breath.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Where is your breath?</p>
<p>In my mouth?</p>
<p>No, it starts in your chest.</p>
<p>You got to focus on your diaphragm.</p>
<p>What the hell's a diaphragm?</p>
<p>Right here. Putting your diaphragm...</p>
<p>No. The diaphragm is a...</p>
<p>No. Really? That's all you know?</p>
<p>It blocks the babies out.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah. That's what...</p>
<p>How'd you make it this far in life?</p>
<p>Look, Dee, this is ridiculous. Let's just get out there. Let's speak the truth.</p>
<p>Let's kick a little ass America style.</p>
<p>We'll get all up in it!</p>
<p>I'm trying to protect you.</p>
<p>I don't want you freezing up out there.</p>
<p>What? Freezing up?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All those people staring at you and judging you... and-and-and-and not liking the stuff and talking about you.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am. Your body could betray you... in any number of ways...</p>
<p>Like how?</p>
<p>You know, one of... Locking up and maybe throwing up and stuff.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. You want to find your breath?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>It's in my mouth.</p>
<p>One, two, three!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You girls have gone wild! You've gone wild!</p>
<p>You went wild!</p>
<p><em>You're wild! Way to go!</p>
<p>You girls went wild!</em></p>
<p>Nice. This is what it was like to have a bar in New Orleans, bro.</p>
<p>Oh, man! New Orleans really had their shit figured out!</p>
<p>Oh, they totally had their shit figured out.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Except for the levees.</p>
<p>Right, yeah. Except for the levees.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, and the evacuation plan.</em></p>
<p>Hey, oh!</p>
<p>Oh! You've gone wild!</p>
<p>You've gone wild!</p>
<p>You've gone wild! You went wild!</p>
<p>This is what America's all about!</p>
<p>This is America!</p>
<p>We have set up an American utopia!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>That could be a bit of a problem back there though.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that could get weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's really smoky.</em></p>
<p>I didn't want to say it because of the spirit of this whole thing. But I think you're right.</p>
<p><em>It's a little much.</p>
<p>These fellows don't mess around.</em></p>
<p>This is high-stakes shit.</p>
<p>You think you can get one... of these white broads to come over and do a table dance for Alan and the boys?</p>
<p>No table dances, okay?</p>
<p>That's what we were worried about.</p>
<p>Listen, Frank. If you can keep those guys as far jammed into that corner as possible...</p>
<p>Push 'em into the corner.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Segregation!</p>
<p>That's segregation! That's not what this is all about. America is a melting pot.</p>
<p>But it might be good to set up some boundaries.</p>
<p>Boundaries?</p>
<p>Sounds like it's coming right out of Stalin's mouth.</p>
<p>Stalin's mouth? That is not what we're talking about. We're just saying...</p>
<p>I don't know who Stalin is. Who the hell is Stalin?</p>
<p>How do you not know?</p>
<p>Listen, man.</p>
<p>Just keep them under control.</p>
<p>You betcha. Oh, here.</p>
<p>They want you to play this Vietnamese music.</p>
<p>They don't like what's playing here.</p>
<p>Okay, listen. Compromise.</p>
<p>Tonight we keep things the way they are.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night, we'll play this shit.</p>
<p>Good. I gotta get back there now because Alan... is just about to bet his wife's glass eye in the next hand.</p>
<p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to speak the truth.</em></p>
<p>We're not gonna spout a bunch of words that are facts... like some big jerk from New York who thinks he's great.</p>
<p>We're gonna show you a dramatic interpretation.</p>
<p>Hello, young man.</p>
<p>I'm a bigwig from Big Tobacco.</p>
<p>I work over here at T.J. Boris.</p>
<p>Can I offer you a cigarette?</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Charlie!</p>
<p>Let's try and look at the bright side here.</p>
<p>This music sounds like whales raping each other.</p>
<p>It does. It does indeed.</p>
<p>But the T-shirts are working.</p>
<p>Isn't that amazing? You ask to see a woman's breasts on the street, you get slapped.</p>
<p>You give her a free T-shirt and videotape it, and the clothes come right off.</p>
<p>I love this country. Hey, yo!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, sweetie. You want a T-shirt?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What? Why'd you stop?</p>
<p>What's wrong?</p>
<p>What's wrong?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Whoa! Come on, pal!</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You're blowing up our spot!</p>
<p>You're just standing there?</p>
<p>Take a walk!</p>
<p>Maybe it's time we set up some rules.</p>
<p>We can't do that. No rules.</p>
<p>Your father is killing our freedom!</p>
<p>I know! I know!</p>
<p>Hey. Hey, you still want that T-shirt?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah? All right.</p>
<p>Okay, any time you're ready.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, what? What's wrong now?</p>
<p>Ruined again!</p>
<p>Whoa! Jesus!</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>I thought you guys were in jail.</p>
<p>Parole.</p>
<p>We heard you guys have a, uh, "anything goes" type situation here.</p>
<p>Can we get a couple glasses of milk?</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>No. You can't have milk.</p>
<p>You can't have milk. No.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Oh, for... You know what? Get out of here.</p>
<p>Could you guys go over there for a second?</p>
<p>We gotta talk for a second. If you could just...</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>I did not see this coming.</p>
<p>We cannot have the McPoyle brothers in here creeping everybody out.</p>
<p>What if Charlie comes in here? He sent them to jail. They may be planning to stab him.</p>
<p>They bang each other, Dennis.</p>
<p>And they bang each other.</p>
<p>They bang each other's...</p>
<p>All right, let's set up a couple rules.</p>
<p>We'll set up a couple rules.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, you can stay.</p>
<p>But none of your weird shit.</p>
<p>I don't follow.</p>
<p>All right, listen. We've heard some things about you two.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna get into the specifics.</p>
<p>We just don't want it in the bar, okay?</p>
<p>It's a free country, bitch.</p>
<p>We may have a problem on our hands, dude.</p>
<p>Do we have any sharp knives?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>These guys are maniacs. They wanna start bettin' fingers.</p>
<p>Fingers?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>If Alan loses this hand, he's gonna start chopping off his fingers.</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like it in my life!</p>
<p>This has gone way too far!</p>
<p>This is getting ridiculous. Your friends, they gotta go!</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>You are killing our freedom, man!</p>
<p>This is what freedom's all about.</p>
<p>I'm living on the edge.</p>
<p>Okay, we're gonna find a compromise here, all right?</p>
<p>Uh, we'll take the bar and you can have the basement!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You want to put me in the basement?</p>
<p>Yeah. You can do whatever you want!</p>
<p>Anything goes in the basement!</p>
<p>If I go in the basement, I can do anything I want?</p>
<p>Anything you want!</p>
<p>No holds barred? There's no limits?</p>
<p>No limits!</p>
<p><em>None.</p>
<p>All right. I'll take the basement.</em></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And now, if you don't mind, I'll take those knives.</p>
<p>All right. Get the knives.</p>
<p>Yeah. And use 'em.</p>
<p>What the hell happened in here?</p>
<p><em>Looks likeJonestown.</p>
<p>Oh, look who it is!</p>
<p>Come to join the party, huh?</em></p>
<p>No. We came back to work.</p>
<p>Oh, have you?</p>
<p>I guess the strike's over, Mac.</p>
<p>The workers have returned.</p>
<p>Uh, I wasn't on strike, okay?</p>
<p>I still need to make a living.</p>
<p>What in the hell has been going on in here?</p>
<p>And where is that music coming from?</p>
<p>From the basement. Frank and the boys have been rocking all night long.</p>
<p>Doing what?</p>
<p>I have no idea. But I bet it's fun.</p>
<p>We've had a line of 50 people outside every night.</p>
<p>Yep. See, our bar is about fun and freedom.</p>
<p>I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that. Freedom?</p>
<p>Yeah. Stick around, bitches. You might learn something about the good old U.S. Of"A."</p>
<p>Hey, Charles.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>How's it hanging?</p>
<p>What? No! What? No!</p>
<p>What are these guys doing here?</p>
<p>Charlie, settle.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Chillax. We're cool.</p>
<p>Bump it.</p>
<p>No. I'm not gonna bump your... Please go.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Please walk away. Please walk away from me.</p>
<p>Please walk away from me.</p>
<p><em>Walk away.</em></p>
<p>How could you do this to me?</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie. We don't want them in the bar either, okay? But freedom has a price.</p>
<p>The McPoyles are probably gonna stab me.</p>
<p>If freedom has its price...</p>
<p>I can't believe you guys! You know what?</p>
<p>Let me kick down a little thing to you that our founding fathers kicked down to me.</p>
<p>It goes, "Don't tread on me." And right now you guys are treading all over me!</p>
<p>Dee, let's roll.</p>
<p>I don't want to go with you.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>You're my actor. I need you.</p>
<p>But you're so bad at protesting.</p>
<p>Come on, Dee. You're my actor.</p>
<p>I don't want to go.</p>
<p>Now you're treading on me!</p>
<p>I'm not treading on you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are. You're treading on me.</p>
<p>And you're not supposed to!</p>
<p>I don't want to go.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Is everyone gonna tread on me?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><em>So you're still trying to be an actor then?</em></p>
<p>Shut your mouth, Dennis.</p>
<p>So now I can call her a failure.</p>
<p>I am not a failure.</p>
<p>Dennis, what is it that you call it... when somebody tries to do something but doesn't succeed?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, that would, in fact, be a failure.</p>
<p>Dee's a failure.</p>
<p>Okay. You want to see some acting?</p>
<p>You want to see some acting?</p>
<p>Guess what. I am gonna act the shit out of somebody's ass.</p>
<p>So here's the thing, Artemis.</p>
<p>I know last time we saw each other... things got kind of awkward when you licked my brother's face.</p>
<p>But I need some help from an actor...</p>
<p>'cause I've been doing this gig with my friend Charlie, and he is really bringing me down.</p>
<p>Oh. Not everyone has the gift.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Want to smoke some hash?</p>
<p>No. Thank you.</p>
<p>So can you help me here?</p>
<p>What's the venue?</p>
<p>The sidewalk.</p>
<p>I don't do sidewalks.</p>
<p>Okay. See, that's what I thought.</p>
<p>But then I realized if you think about it... street performing, it's the last true form of organic artistic expression.</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>Yes. I think you and I need to get out there.</p>
<p>We need to prove to the world that we still got it.</p>
<p>Sweet, Sweet Dee... it's not something you can lose, okay?</p>
<p>Right. So let's go show the world.</p>
<p>Is there any nudity involved?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can there be?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'll do it anyway.</p>
<p>I don't understand this.</p>
<p><em>McPoyles.</p>
<p>McPoyles everywhere, dude.</em></p>
<p>Girls don't want to go wild in this environment, not even for T-shirts!</p>
<p>Hey, man. My sister wants to ask you something.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She's mute, dude.</p>
<p>Mute?</p>
<p>Okay, what?</p>
<p><em>She wants to show you her boobies.</p>
<p>What?</em></p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>Trust me. They're top-notch.</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Goddamn it!</p>
<p>That is disgusting!</p>
<p>What is wrong with you people?</p>
<p>That's your sister!</p>
<p>Hey, man. There's nothing wrong with us.</p>
<p>We're just expressing ourselves.</p>
<p>Society has the problem.</p>
<p>Where do you keep your Pledge?</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Go away. Go with your brother and sister.</p>
<p>Take a walk.</p>
<p>Dee, thank you so much for this acting opportunity.</p>
<p>I can tell it is going to be a glorious performance.</p>
<p>Those guys are full of shit, Artemis.</p>
<p>There's not 50 people here.</p>
<p>Focus, Dee, focus!</p>
<p>But that's the reason why we're here.</p>
<p>Those guys said there would be a big crowd.</p>
<p>We'll draw them in.</p>
<p>All right. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please gather around.</p>
<p>You're about to see an original street performance.</p>
<p>Take yourselves to the foggy streets of London.</p>
<p>The year is 1888.</p>
<p>There's a killer on the loose.</p>
<p>His name, Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p>Two women walking alone home from a holiday cotillion.</p>
<p>I say...</p>
<p><em>Get out of here! Get out of here!</em></p>
<p>If you come to this bar, you're gonna get cancer and die!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>We're protesting the bar!</p>
<p>Attica! Attica!</p>
<p>Attica, man! Attica, man!</p>
<p>Attica, man! Attica!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, man! What are you doing?</p>
<p>Tying off.</p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>Go tie off somewhere else!</p>
<p>I thought we could do whatever we want.</p>
<p>Give me the hose.</p>
<p>Give me the little rubber hose.</p>
<p>Whoa, he's got a knife!</p>
<p>Okay, great. He's got a knife.</p>
<p>Of course he does! Why not?</p>
<p>You know what? Keep the little rubber hose!</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Good life decision, man.</p>
<p>Mac, I think we gave people too much freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're right, man.</p>
<p>I'll call the cops.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. We can't call the cops. That's admitting failure.</p>
<p>Dennis, we gave people too much freedom.</p>
<p>That's the problem!</p>
<p>All they do is exploit it!</p>
<p>It's becomes anarchy. That is not what America is all about.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, America is... Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on, Dee! Don't quit! Come on.</p>
<p>We just rocked out there, Dee!</p>
<p><em>Oh, we did? Yeah, we did.</p>
<p>Don't be a quitter. Okay?</em></p>
<p>I don't care. I don't want to act anymore.</p>
<p>I quit. I want to drink.</p>
<p>That's what I would like to do for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Don't give up.</p>
<p>Why don't you leave me alone?</p>
<p>Can you imagine an America where everyone just gives up?</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>Okay, great. Let's just give up!</p>
<p>All right, Charlie.</p>
<p>Have you come to gloat and shove it in my face?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, it's okay. You can. You know why?</p>
<p><em>'Cause I give up. I'm living in give-up America now. - What are you talking about?</em></p>
<p>Will you shut up?</p>
<p>Look at this! I'm gonna be a smoker too.</p>
<p>You don't have to smoke, Charlie.</p>
<p>No, we can. You know why?</p>
<p>'Cause we give up. We live in give-up America.</p>
<p>I live in give-up America.</p>
<p>We're living in America...</p>
<p>Hey, Ryan. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Look, man, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but if you're not too busy... showering in your brother's urine or plotting your revenge against me... you mind lighting my cigarette?</p>
<p>Thanks, bro. Hey, Liam.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I sent you to jail, man.</p>
<p>But any time you wanna stab me, it'd be really great for me.</p>
<p>That's what you get, Charlie!</p>
<p>Whoa, hey! Get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>You get fork stabbed!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>Fork stabbed!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>And don't try to mess with us 'cause now we're even!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>Nobody messes with the McPoyles!</p>
<p><em>Oh, you had to make a scene, Charlie!</em></p>
<p>You had to run your mouth in front of psychopaths, didn't you?</p>
<p>I just got stabbed with a fork!</p>
<p>Whose fault is that, Captain America?</p>
<p>Way to go!</p>
<p>It's Dee's fault for quitting on me.</p>
<p>Oh, it's Dee's fault!</p>
<p>How is it...</p>
<p>Maybe it's your fault for being horrible at everything!</p>
<p>Here we go with this again.</p>
<p>Everybody pass the buck! Pass the blame!</p>
<p>Dennis, we have to admit, it's over.</p>
<p>It's done.</p>
<p>We gotta get all of these assholes out of here right now.</p>
<p>Dee, you get everybody out of the bar.</p>
<p>Charlie, you're a disappointment.</p>
<p>Come on. Let's go get everybody out of the basement.</p>
<p>God only knows what's going on down there.</p>
<p>I'll call the cops.</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
