<p><em>Aw, come on! This isn't fair.</p>
<p>You accidentally burn down a building, and you get 120 hours of community service?</em></p>
<p>Now this says that I gotta work with kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>I don't like kids. I don't wanna work with 'em.</p>
<p>I don't have time for this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have 248 hours of, uh...</p>
<p>Interstate.</p>
<p>Inter... Interstate.</p>
<p>Sanitation. Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>What is that... What is that?</p>
<p>That's the guys with the orange vests who pick up trash.</p>
<p>Orange vests.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! And then what is this about the A. A?</p>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
<p>For...</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Six months.</p>
<p>That is so unfair!</p>
<p>What do you expect? Why would you tell the judge you were drunk?</p>
<p>'Cause I was drunk.</p>
<p>But why would you say that?</p>
<p>I thought that would get me off the hook.</p>
<p>That was dumb, wasn't it?</p>
<p>I would rather pay a huge fine than have to give back to the community.</p>
<p>Holy shit! Look at this bill!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Those mimosas were like eight bucks a pop, Charlie.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Well, you had like seven of'em.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Bro, I'm not paying for your mimosas.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>I didn't even bring enough money for those.</p>
<p>I don't have enough money.</p>
<p>You don't have any money?</p>
<p>What are you... Are you serious?</p>
<p>Ah! Ah!</p>
<p><em>Good. Good. Good.</p>
<p>Go ahead. Go ahead.</em></p>
<p>I know what it is.</p>
<p>We can't go back.</p>
<p>I fold. Deal me out. Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, gang, what's the action?</p>
<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>Asians love gambling.</p>
<p>You know these guys?</p>
<p>Yeah. From 'Nam.</p>
<p>You were in Vietnam?</p>
<p>Don't get excited, Mac, all right?</p>
<p>He was in Vietnam 10 years ago on a business trip.</p>
<p>Beautiful country.</p>
<p>Dad, please get these guys out of here.</p>
<p>They're really weird and scary looking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, I own half this bar too.</p>
<p>You can't just come in here and start running our lives. It's not fair.</p>
<p><em>Wanna bet?</p>
<p>What?</em></p>
<p>Would you like to bet on it?</p>
<p>On what?</p>
<p>Whether or not it's fair?</p>
<p>Sure. Bet on whatever.</p>
<p>You know what? This is exactly why I don't wanna work with him. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because you start doing crazy shit like this all the time... and making crazy bets about absolutely nothing at all, Dad.</p>
<p>If you don't go, me and Mac and Charlie, we're gonna sell our portion of the bar.</p>
<p>No, we're not.</p>
<p>No, that's not happening.</p>
<p>Just back me up on this.</p>
<p>No, I can't really back you up.</p>
<p>Why can't you just back me up on this?</p>
<p>You guys...</p>
<p>Screw this.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>That just blew my mind.</p>
<p>That was incredible.</p>
<p><em>So today's speaker is David...</em> for those of you who are new to the program.</p>
<p><em>I know a number of you have heard David's story before.</p>
<p>But a few of you haven't.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll find David's story... has a lot of relevance to your situation.</p>
<p>Uh, anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and...</p>
<p>We have a late arrival here.</p>
<p>Hi. Do you want to introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Oh. I'm Charlie.</p>
<p><em>Hi, Charlie.</em></p>
<p>Here. Have a seat down front.</p>
<p>Oh. No. Okay.</p>
<p>I knew this would happen.</p>
<p>I'm not an alcoholic actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm only here 'cause I got a little drunk... and I threw a flaming bag of feces into a building and I burnt it down a little bit.</p>
<p><em>You know? But I wasn't trying to burn it down.</em></p>
<p>I was trying to make the place smell real bad and get rid of this guy.</p>
<p>So... This guy knows what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Look, uh, Charlie, the first step to recovery... is simply admitting that you have a problem.</p>
<p>I'm not an alcoholic, so it's cool.</p>
<p>He was drinking a beer when he came in.</p>
<p>Oh, my... Dude! Oh, dude, how are you gonna...</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I thought you were cool, man, like...</p>
<p><em>I'm not gonna sell my piece of the bar.</em></p>
<p>You're being such a dick about this.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do, get another job?</p>
<p>Well, try to think where I'm coming from in all this. I'm coming from a selfish place?</p>
<p><em>Just shut your mouth.</p>
<p>Can I help you?</em></p>
<p>We are here as part of our community service.</p>
<p>Always a bunch of clowns.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>All right. We need volunteers for our Sunday basketball league.</p>
<p>You're gonna be coaching the teams.</p>
<p>I got two positions left, so I'm gonna have to put two of you together.</p>
<p>Great. Dennis and I will coach a team.</p>
<p>I think I'd rather split you two up.</p>
<p>Charlie. Hi.</p>
<p>Hey. Wow. I didn't know you were in A.A.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where were you sitting?</p>
<p>I, um, kind of slumped down in my seat when I heard your name so you wouldn't see me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Listen. I didn't realize you were an alcoholic.</p>
<p>It actually explains a lot of your past behavior.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>I'm not an alcoholic.</p>
<p>See, I have to be here 'cause the court...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I threw this flaming bag of feces...</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>You don't have to give me explanations. I understand.</p>
<p>I've maybe been a little too judgmental of you.</p>
<p>I mean, I know what it feels like to have alcohol run your life.</p>
<p>Doesn't run my life.</p>
<p>And I... I want to maybe help you.</p>
<p>Are you saying you want to go out on a date with me?</p>
<p>No. No, Charlie.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>I don't... I never want to go out on a date with you.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is... maybe I could... be your sponsor.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>But you can't ever hit on me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because that's never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard. You said that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, sponsor. That's cool, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I wrote down my phone number.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Please. Please, Charlie. Please don't make me regret giving this to you.</p>
<p>No, absolute...</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>No, this'll be a platonic sponsor-sponsoree kind of a thing.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Oh. No shit!</p>
<p>I was so close.</p>
<p>All right, kids, kids. Uh, why don't you line up on this free throw line over here.</p>
<p>All righty. Uh, you...</p>
<p><em>you, you, you and you...</em> come over here.</p>
<p>All right. Now the rest of you kids can go with those two losers right there.</p>
<p><em>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>What the hell's goin'on over here?</em></p>
<p>Pickin' my team.</p>
<p>No. No, y-you can't... you can't take all...</p>
<p>I can't pick the...</p>
<p>You can't pick all...</p>
<p>What should I not pick?</p>
<p>You know exactly what you've done, sir.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody back.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's my team!</p>
<p>No, we're startin' over.</p>
<p>All right. Fine. But I pick first.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Uh, you.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p><em>Hey! ho!</p>
<p>What's goin'on over here?</em></p>
<p>Pickin' teams.</p>
<p>The teams are already picked.</p>
<p>You two have the Ducks, and you have the Wildcats.</p>
<p>Ducks.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Are...</p>
<p>You guys are the Wildcats?</p>
<p><em>Jesus Chri...</em></p>
<p>Is anyone absent?</p>
<p><em>Anyone tall?</p>
<p>What are those, flip-flops?</em></p>
<p>Jesus, kid.</p>
<p>Did you not wear shoes?</p>
<p><em>You don't know?</p>
<p>Did anyone else not bring shoes?</em></p>
<p>All right, kids.</p>
<p>Everybody take a knee.</p>
<p>Go ahead and kneel.</p>
<p>Apparently there is some confusion as to who is the head coach here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be a guy who's never participated... in any kind of sporting event ever.</p>
<p>Yeah, or it could be a girl.</p>
<p>That's enough said, right?</p>
<p><em>Mac and I are gonna play a quick game to 21.</em></p>
<p>And the winner will be head coach.</p>
<p>You guys might want to pay attention...</p>
<p>'cause you could probably learn a thing or two from watching us.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Try to remember what she does wrong.</p>
<p>That's the first thing.</p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
<p>Take a lap.</p>
<p>God awful.</p>
<p>Get goin'.</p>
<p><em>Oh, that's a great shot, Chris. Come here.</p>
<p>You're gonna be the saving grace of this team.</em></p>
<p>Everybody try to be a little bit more like Chris.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's diet.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Do I look like I need to be on a diet?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
<p>Take a lap.</p>
<p>This one? Gonna get it this time?</p>
<p><em>See, kids, that's 18-0.</p>
<p>Fundamentals don't mean shit if you got no strength.</em></p>
<p>My knee hurts.</p>
<p>We're almost done.</p>
<p>Oh, God. You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><em>So this is your place?</p>
<p>Wow!</em></p>
<p>You know, it actually looks a lot like my apartment.</p>
<p>Don't sit on my bed.</p>
<p>No. No. Wasn't gonna.</p>
<p>That's a good bed though.</p>
<p>That's a beautiful bed. Nice and soft.</p>
<p>Charlie, are you here to try to have sex with me?</p>
<p>I can't believe you could ask me a question like that in my time of need.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's okay. We... We got a history, and you're suspicious.</p>
<p>I get that. We got a crazy history, you and me. Oh, well.</p>
<p>You know, maybe I'll just... maybe I'll just get a little comfortable... and I won't talk, and you can just kinda...</p>
<p><em>Just watch your feet on the... tell me about...</em></p>
<p>I'll take my shoes off.</p>
<p>No. Just don't take your shoes off.</p>
<p>I'm really more comfortable if I take my shoes off.</p>
<p><em>Charlie.</p>
<p>So tell me about you.</em></p>
<p>What kind of music are you into?</p>
<p>What's your favorite color?</p>
<p>You ever... You ever owned a dog?</p>
<p>Do you want a dog?</p>
<p>This thing is cozy.</p>
<p>Just ice it and it will go down.</p>
<p>I know what you do to it!</p>
<p>Hey, what's the action?</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ! Are you gonna keep saying that? Is that your catch phrase now?</p>
<p>Dad, can you please get me some ice?</p>
<p>What happened to your eye?</p>
<p>Well, Mac plays basketball with his elbows. That's what happened.</p>
<p>Youse were all playin' basketball?</p>
<p>Yeah. It's a part of our community service.</p>
<p>Gotta coach kids.</p>
<p>It's part of our, uh, sentence.</p>
<p>Like two teams playin' against each other?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's generally how basketball is played.</p>
<p>Basketball, huh? Here.</p>
<p><em>And go! Very nice.</em></p>
<p>Lot of tight footwork.</p>
<p>That's it. Very good.</p>
<p>Chris, doin' really good.</p>
<p>You got some good moves.</p>
<p>Dad, what the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I just came because you were late. I volunteered.</p>
<p>Hey, do some ball work.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p>I figured maybe you and I could do a little father-son bonding.</p>
<p>I don't wanna bond with you. Go back to bonding with Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie's with a girl.</p>
<p>What girl?</p>
<p>You know, the waitress girl.</p>
<p>The waitress hates Charlie.</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>Because he's obsessed with her and won't leave her alone.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I banged her. I don't get it.</p>
<p>Dennis, you shouldn't be sleeping with your friends' girlfriends.</p>
<p>What, are you handing down life lessons?</p>
<p>Get the hell outta here! Get off my court!</p>
<p>What? Your court?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wanna shoot for it? Free throws?</p>
<p>Shoot for what?</p>
<p>Throw me the ball.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, best out of three gets to be the coach.</p>
<p>Dad, you don't wanna shoot me for it, because you'll lose.</p>
<p>You wanna bet?</p>
<p>Okay, kids, keys to the game.</p>
<p>Elbows. Knees.</p>
<p>Say it with me once. Ready?</p>
<p>Elbows. Knees.</p>
<p><em>Excellent. Excellent work. Now you're gonna want to utilize both of those...</em> over the course of the season, okay?</p>
<p>Because the referees in this league aren't gonna call 'em.</p>
<p>But they might, which is why you have to be very careful.</p>
<p>Fouls can lose a game for even the most dominant of teams.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, kids, could you excuse the assistant coach and I for a second?</em></p>
<p>We'll be back.</p>
<p><em>Don't you ever contradict me in front of my team like that.</em></p>
<p>These kids need to know who their coach is.</p>
<p>Well, I can see how they might be confused.</p>
<p>Are those combat boots?</p>
<p>Don't get all high-and-mighty because you got a pantsuit. You look like Big Bird!</p>
<p><em>I got the season schedule right here.</em></p>
<p>Get back! I can handle this.</p>
<p>I have to see.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Why are you here?</p>
<p>I'm coaching Dennis's team.</p>
<p>Not coaching my team.</p>
<p>You lost fair and square.</p>
<p>Don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Oh, it is on!</p>
<p>We play you guys first!</p>
<p>We are gonna school your sorry-ass team!</p>
<p>Wanna make it interesting?</p>
<p>Dad, you don't wanna do that.</p>
<p>Our kids are terrible.</p>
<p>That's what a bad coach would say.</p>
<p>A hundred bucks says we win.</p>
<p>You're on. I'm gonna coach the shit out of this team.</p>
<p>Well, assistant coach.</p>
<p>Let's make it 200.</p>
<p>How about five, bitch?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You scared? You wanna quit? You can back out.</p>
<p>'Cause I can coach this team better than you or Dennis or Dad... or any other goddamn man any day of the week.</p>
<p>Whoo! Whoo!</p>
<p>That's it! Gambling!</p>
<p>Oh, I can't tell you how great I'm feeling.</p>
<p>I haven't been this healthy in, like, a crazy long time.</p>
<p>It's having amazing effects on my body.</p>
<p><em>That's probably the best thing about it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Wow.</em></p>
<p>So you can probably stop coming over here all the time then, huh?</p>
<p>Uh, well, I don't know.</p>
<p>I just don't know if that's safe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's safe.</p>
<p>Maybe if you think it's safe, I'll consider it.</p>
<p>But whoo...</p>
<p>Hey, um, how's your friend Dennis?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>I haven't seen him around much lately.</p>
<p>What...</p>
<p>What's he up to?</p>
<p>He's, like, working at some stupid youth center thing.</p>
<p>He works with kids?</p>
<p>Yeah. But he has to. That's why.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That is so sweet.</em></p>
<p>Do you think maybe we could go down and see him?</p>
<p>Why don't we roll down there today?</p>
<p>You know, you and me.</p>
<p>Celebrate the three days sober.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I'll get changed.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So get out.</p>
<p>Actually I probably need to take a shower, 'cause I'm crazy sweaty from those.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm an alcoholic trying to get better... and I'm getting kicked out on the street.</p>
<p>All right. Jesus.</p>
<p>You can start.</p>
<p><em>These are wristbands...</em> and these are safety pins.</p>
<p>I want everybody to insert their safety pin into their wristband... sharp side out.</p>
<p>All right, if you come down right on the top part and smash down with all your weight... you'll break the kid's foot in three places.</p>
<p>What if I get hurt?</p>
<p>That's a good question.</p>
<p>Now as long as you hurt the other kid... as bad or worse than he hurts you... you'll have done your job, and I'll be proud of you.</p>
<p>Look how good he is with those kids.</p>
<p>You like that, huh?</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p><em>Okay, here we go. Lay it up.</p>
<p>Shoot it up. Let's see.</p>
<p>Whoo. Very nice.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody take five. Chris, come on over here a minute. I'm gonna talk to you.</em></p>
<p>Let's see. Go on over there.</p>
<p>You go... You guys go.</p>
<p>Now listen. Clearly, you're the best player on the team.</p>
<p>All right? Now I wanna give you a couple lessons... that maybe Coach Dennis hasn't covered with you.</p>
<p>Lesson number one: Winnin' ain't everything.</p>
<p>Lesson two: Do you own a bike?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Dennis, hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I haven't seen you in a while.</p>
<p>You haven't come by the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Um, so I know that it was kind of... it got weird after the...</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When we...</p>
<p>Um, anyway...</p>
<p>I thought maybe we could spend some time together again.</p>
<p>Um, haven't you been spending a lot of time with Charlie lately?</p>
<p>I'm helping him get sober.</p>
<p>Right. Well, good.</p>
<p>That's a good thing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I don't want to get in the middle of that.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So we shouldn't talk at all while that's going on.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Good. All right.</p>
<p>I'll see you.</p>
<p>Wha... You will see me.</p>
<p>I'll see you.</p>
<p>Yep, yep, yep, yep.</p>
<p>Charlie, this isn't working out.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I don't wanna be your sponsor anymore. It's starting to get in the way of my personal life.</p>
<p>What are you talkin' about?</p>
<p>I only offered to be your sponsor... so I could get closer to your friend Dennis.</p>
<p>What? Dennis?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on! That guy, he's like one of those cheesy...</p>
<p>Oh, he's so phony. No. You know what?</p>
<p>We can't do this action.</p>
<p>You gotta... 'Cause what if I start drinking again?</p>
<p>That's a risk I'm willing to take.</p>
<p>I hope you guys are ready for the pain.</p>
<p>Oh, we'll be bringing a little pain of our own.</p>
<p>You guys are goin' down.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>All right, kids, how are you feelin'?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good? Doesn't sound good.</p>
<p>Are you drinking the Red Bull?</p>
<p>Come on. Chug 'em down.</p>
<p>I feel sick.</p>
<p>That's the vitamins ripping out the inside of your stomach. That's a good thing. Trust me.</p>
<p>Flop, come here for a second.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>These are for you.</p>
<p>And there's a steel toe in there.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to use it.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p>I'm not your dad.</p>
<p><em>All right. Let's get this show on the road.</em></p>
<p>All right, Team Wildcats!</p>
<p>Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!</p>
<p>All right, boys. Now listen up.</p>
<p>This week... Where's Chris?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>You don't know? You guys know where Chris is?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ah, it's no big deal. We don't need him.</p>
<p>It is a big deal. We can't play without Chris.</p>
<p>I got 500 bucks on this game.</p>
<p>Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Well, let's...</p>
<p>I gotta find him. We can't play without him.</p>
<p>No. You can't go.</p>
<p>He lives a block away. I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Dennis, where...</p>
<p>I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Let's go. Get ready. Put your shoes on.</p>
<p>Hey, Chris, you in there?</p>
<p>Chris, come on, buddy. Let's go.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>The game's about to start.</p>
<p>I got a new bike.</p>
<p>So ride your bike after the game.</p>
<p>I'm not supposed to play.</p>
<p>What do you mean, you're not supposed to play?</p>
<p>You know what? I don't have to talk to you, shithead!</p>
<p><em>You bought Chris a new bike to throw the game. The bet's off.</em></p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>You can't call the bet off.</p>
<p>Dad's up to something.</p>
<p>I'm not up to nothing.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Hey, Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Hey, um, just... I want...</p>
<p>Just good luck out there.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I just wanted to say good luck.</p>
<p>All right. Great. Thanks.</p>
<p>Um, why don't you have a seat on the bleachers? I'm in the middle of something.</p>
<p>No way. I'm not sitting up there.</p>
<p>It's way too smoky.</p>
<p>You cheating piece of shit.</p>
<p><em>Oh, let's go!</em></p>
<p>Let's... Let's play some basketball, all right?</p>
<p>Charlie, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I volunteered.</p>
<p>Let's play some ball.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You know what, man?</p>
<p>You gotta call this game off.</p>
<p>Oh, you're dead to me. There's a dead man speaking to me right here.</p>
<p>Great. You're drunk.</p>
<p>I'm dead to you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am drunk.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p><em>I don't have a sponsor anymore!</p>
<p>Whatever, Charlie.</p>
<p>Let's play basketball!</p>
<p>You gotta call this game off, Charlie!</em></p>
<p>Let's have the teams! Let's play ball!</p>
<p>Let's play.</p>
<p>You're not gonna get away with this, Dad.</p>
<p>I haven't got a clue what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Get him with the elbow!</p>
<p><em>What the hell are you doing?</em></p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p><em>All right, Charlie, that's it!</em></p>
<p>You call this game!</p>
<p>This game is over!</p>
<p>You got a problem? Button that lip!</p>
<p>Don't tell me to button my lip!</p>
<p>Is that a threat?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a threat!</p>
<p>You're outta here!</p>
<p>Charlie, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I call 'em like I see 'em.</p>
<p>Come on, man. Calm down.</p>
<p>You're outta here!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Yes! I'm head coach!</p>
<p>This is your fault, Dad!</p>
<p>Why is it my fault?</p>
<p>Because you fixed the game!</p>
<p><em>You fixed the game?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Yes, he fixed the game!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>How do you do something like that?</p>
<p>Do you see what you've done?</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>You're in the showers!</em></p>
