<p><em>These things are hilarious.</p>
<p>These are priceless.</p>
<p>What are you guys lookin'at?</em></p>
<p>Uh, Garbage Pail Kids.</p>
<p>Heavin' Steven.</p>
<p>Classic.</p>
<p>Totally classic. I love Heavin' Steven.</p>
<p><em>Are those those stupid cards where babies are doing disgusting things?</em></p>
<p>Uh, no. They're the amazing cards where babies are doing hysterical things.</p>
<p>You got quite a collection there, buddy.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, how about givin' me a couple of these?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>I tell you what.</p>
<p>I'll buy 'em from you.</p>
<p>You got a ton of'em.</p>
<p>No. These are, like, an investment.</p>
<p><em>This is my future here, so don't mess with them.</em></p>
<p>Hey, have you guys seen this?</p>
<p>We are getting blasted in the ass by the state liquor tax.</p>
<p>"Blasted in the ass"?</p>
<p>Mac, we have this same conversation every year.</p>
<p>There's nothing you can do about taxes.</p>
<p>You guys might want to think about voting every once in a while.</p>
<p>What has voting ever done?</p>
<p>Why... Since wh... What has...</p>
<p><em>Why are you comin'down... Voting?</p>
<p>Who am I supposed to vote for?</em></p>
<p>Am I supposed to vote for the Democrat who's gonna blast me in the ass... or the Republican who's blasting my ass?</p>
<p>Politics is just one big ass blast.</p>
<p>It is a coast-to-coast, nationwide ass blast.</p>
<p>You're gonna get your ass...</p>
<p><em>No more! You guys are such morons.</em></p>
<p>If you knew anything at all about politics, you would know that that is not true.</p>
<p>Deandra, it's just some jerk gettin' into office... so he can get out for the payday.</p>
<p>Right. The guy's runnin' for office.</p>
<p>He's... What? What payday?</p>
<p>I see it every year.</p>
<p>Some clown runs for office, drops out of the race... and gets a big chunk of dough.</p>
<p><em>I mean, you have to be a real low-life piece of shit...</em> to get involved in politics.</p>
<p><em>Okay. I just got off the phone with the city clerk.</em></p>
<p>Turns out there's an election comin' up.</p>
<p>Local, small-time shit. Anybody can run.</p>
<p>What's the position?</p>
<p>"South Philly, Zone 2, District 37 Comptroller.</p>
<p>Nice. What's a comptroller?</p>
<p>Who gives a shit? We're doin' it for the bribe.</p>
<p>I nominate Dennis.</p>
<p>I accept your nomination.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. How come he gets to be the candidate?</p>
<p>Take a look at that hair...</p>
<p>Kennedy hair.</p>
<p>Note the bone structure.</p>
<p>It's like a young J.F.K.</p>
<p>I got the same bone structure.</p>
<p>What are you making that noise...</p>
<p>What is that about?</p>
<p>You got something funky goin' on in the forehead area.</p>
<p>Five head.</p>
<p>Did you say five head?</p>
<p>I don't have that.</p>
<p>Deandra, a woman in politics is like a donkey doing calculus.</p>
<p>Come on. There are plenty of amazing women politicians.</p>
<p>Name one.</p>
<p>Uh, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>Awful.</p>
<p>How is she awful?</p>
<p>Hates freedom.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Okay, Dennis, you are gonna need a campaign manager. That's me.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Ooh. We should put that one to a vote.</p>
<p>'Cause I'd be a good campaign manager.</p>
<p>It's too late.</p>
<p>I already have the clipboard.</p>
<p>So you can be my assistant.</p>
<p>Mmm. Assistant is...</p>
<p>Should I wear a blazer? - Yes. - No.</p>
<p>Yes. - No. - I like what he said.</p>
<p>Charlie? Campaign manager.</p>
<p>You don't need a blazer.</p>
<p>A blazer's gonna look...</p>
<p>I like where he's goin'.</p>
<p>What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>You get to be the intern.</p>
<p>Yeah, the intern.</p>
<p>What does an intern do?</p>
<p>Cut limes. - Stock glasses. - Serve drinks.</p>
<p>No. No. Come on. You guys, damn you!</p>
<p>I'm not doing that.</p>
<p>Hold it! Hold it!</p>
<p>If my son is gonna solicit a bribe, he's gonna do it the right way.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be campaign manager.</p>
<p>Like hell you are.</p>
<p>You are way too old.</p>
<p>Politics is a young man's game.</p>
<p>Mac, I think you might be in over your head here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Over my head?</p>
<p>Yeah. Listen.</p>
<p>Everybody who's in favor of firing Mac as campaign manager... raise their hand.</p>
<p>For God sakes!</p>
<p>The people have spoken. You're out.</p>
<p>So that's it? I'm fired?</p>
<p>This is bullshit!</p>
<p>That's politics, man.</p>
<p>That's politics? That's politics?</p>
<p>This is wonderful.</p>
<p>This is just wonderful. You know what?</p>
<p>I'm walkin' outta here.</p>
<p>I don't need this shit.</p>
<p>I'm washin' my hands of the whole situation.</p>
<p>Show you, bitches.</p>
<p>Can I grab that clipboard?</p>
<p>No. That's mine.</p>
<p>Dee, check out my blazer.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's too small.</p>
<p>Nah. It's perfect.</p>
<p>How's the bar?</p>
<p>Full of hoboes, Dennis. A lot of hoboes.</p>
<p>Watch your ears. There you go.</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Frank, I don't... I just don't think this is the best idea for our candidate's image.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant idea...</p>
<p>"hobo-vertising."</p>
<p>Come on. It looks good. Beer him.</p>
<p><em>We gotta fire Frank.</p>
<p>He's my dad, Charlie. I don't know.</em></p>
<p>But, Dennis. Dennis.</p>
<p>Hobo-vertising?</p>
<p>That's not you. It's cheap.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>It's cheap politics.</p>
<p>It's not gonna get us that bribe.</p>
<p>I mean, you need to be out there.</p>
<p>You gotta be shakin' hands.</p>
<p>You gotta be kissin' babies.</p>
<p>I don't like babies.</p>
<p>No babies.</p>
<p>Don't kiss babies.</p>
<p>Just get out there into the world, and...</p>
<p>You gotta let me be your campaign manager.</p>
<p>I mean, I can really drive this thing in a different direction.</p>
<p>I mean, when I look at you, I see success.</p>
<p>I see... You're top-notch.</p>
<p>You're goin' all the way with this thing.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Frank's just gettin' in the way here.</p>
<p>Give me this chance.</p>
<p>Just give it to me.</p>
<p>I just didn't realize I was gonna have to make so many... tough decisions.</p>
<p>Take him down.</p>
<p><em>This is a goddamn coup!</em></p>
<p>Don't take it personally, Dad.</p>
<p>That's just politics.</p>
<p>You look like a dick in that tiny jacket.</p>
<p>Let's not attack my candidate.</p>
<p>Don't go after the jacket.</p>
<p><em>Shut up, Charlie.</p>
<p>The jacket's good.</em></p>
<p>I can talk to my son any way I want.</p>
<p>Give him the clipboard. -</p>
<p>Give me the clipboard. - No. No.</p>
<p>Clipboard belongs to the campaign manager.</p>
<p>I want that clipboard.</p>
<p>Go to hell.</p>
<p>Oh, that was ugly.</p>
<p>That was uncalled for.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p><em>Wow. That was, uh, a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be.</em></p>
<p>I can get a clipboard anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>I want you to run for comptroller.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm gonna be your campaign manager.</p>
<p>We're gonna stroll right into that comptroller's office and solicit a bribe.</p>
<p>Forget it. I am not helping you.</p>
<p>Deandra, we'll get this bribe... and we'll shove it right in your brother's face.</p>
<p>We'll screw those guys.</p>
<p>I would like to shove it in his face.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. Now let's get you ready for the ball, Cinderella.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>The bangs, they... The five head.</p>
<p><em>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You want to try and solicit a bribe?</em></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You want my union to back your roommate... for South Philly District 37 Comptroller?</p>
<p>Yes. Correct.</p>
<p>But not to win.</p>
<p>It sounds illegal.</p>
<p>Aw, for God sakes.</p>
<p>What is with you two?</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>You know, like, in the movies, union guys are, like, tough and shady and shit.</p>
<p>Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p>You're, like, a couple of nerds.</p>
<p><em>All right, look. Let me take you bitches to school for a second.</em></p>
<p>In this country, in the real world, people make money.</p>
<p>Somebody is gonna make a ton of money off my roommate.</p>
<p>I want it to be you.</p>
<p>Let me make one thing perfectly clear.</p>
<p>We are not a criminal organization.</p>
<p>Why are you talking to me like I'm a jackass? I am not a ja...</p>
<p>Oh. I see what you're doin'.</p>
<p>Okay. Nobody here is a criminal. No, sir.</p>
<p>I think we're speaking the same language.</p>
<p>Are we?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We're being listened to.</p>
<p>Bugged. The feds. I get it.</p>
<p>I read. I see movies.</p>
<p>I understand. Okay.</p>
<p>I want you to contact me at Paddy's.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get the ball rolling, okay?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>It's safe there.</p>
<p>Okay, gentlemen, sorry we couldn't work anything out.</p>
<p>But, uh, I'm gonna go home and pay my taxes.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You want me to call the cops?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I've got a better idea.</p>
<p>Let's screw this son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Come on, Morris.</p>
<p>We don't have time for this.</p>
<p>He called us nerds, Gary.</p>
<p>Nerds.</p>
<p>Are you gonna take care of the crime problem here?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I say we put 'em on busses, ship 'em over to Iraq... make 'em fight the terrorists.</p>
<p>You're very handsome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This is going very, very well, man.</p>
<p>People are really responding to me.</p>
<p>They love the bone structure.</p>
<p>They like the Kennedy hair.</p>
<p>I've been looking for you guys.</p>
<p>Look, I've been thinkin', and I feel like I could be a real asset to you guys.</p>
<p>I want to help.</p>
<p>What? Wait, wait.</p>
<p>First you wash your hands of politics.</p>
<p>Now you want back in.</p>
<p>That's called flip-flopping. That's what Democrats do. - Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Let's give the guy a chance to prove himself.</p>
<p>Yeah. Give me a chance.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>"What should I do?"</p>
<p>Strike one, buddy.</p>
<p>You gotta bring something to the table, Mac.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Ah, check this out.</p>
<p><em>Excuse me. Hi.</em></p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice your adorable baby.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind...</p>
<p><em>if that handsome young gentleman over there kissed it.</em></p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Oh. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>He's running for District 37 Comptroller, so it's cool.</p>
<p>You know, I'd rather not.</p>
<p>It's good for him, and it's good for you.</p>
<p>I think you should just give me the baby.</p>
<p>Please leave me alone.</p>
<p>Okay, lady.</p>
<p>If you give me the baby, I could get it over with.</p>
<p>I said no!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Just give me the baby!</p>
<p>Somebody help me!</p>
<p>Lady! Give me the ba...</p>
<p>This is campaign suicide, dude.</p>
<p>Let's get outta here.</p>
<p><em>There, there, there.</em></p>
<p>There, there, there.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>Got it on? Sure?</p>
<p>Yeah. Take a look.</p>
<p><em>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think I look like a whore.</em></p>
<p>I'm trying to make you sexy.</p>
<p>This is not sexy.</p>
<p>What is this? What's this?</p>
<p>It's the bed look.</p>
<p>The tossed look.</p>
<p>The ruffled look.</p>
<p>You look like you just got...</p>
<p>Anyway, we have to convince this guy...</p>
<p>That we're a legitimate threat to his campaign.</p>
<p>There is nothing more threatening to a man... than a woman who is smart and attractive.</p>
<p>We have to pretend you're both.</p>
<p>Wow. You're a horrible father.</p>
<p>Let's just go. Let's get it done.</p>
<p>Great. Great.</p>
<p>Now, Daddy hates to say this, but...</p>
<p>I think we should talk about the breasts.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't hurt my baby."</p>
<p>Like I'm gonna hurt somebody's baby.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Goddamn Dennis. Fire me?</p>
<p><em>I'll fire you.</p>
<p>Mac. Get in.</em></p>
<p>We got a bribe for your roommate's withdrawal from the race.</p>
<p>Really? Wow.</p>
<p>You nerds work fast.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>How much did we get?</p>
<p>We don't get any money until you pull your guy from the race.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><em>Okay, uh...</em></p>
<p>That's not gonna be a problem, is it?</p>
<p>No. That's not gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>Better not be, Mac.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Marvin here is gonna have to take care of you.</p>
<p>Take care of me how?</p>
<p>I'll probably stab you in your throat.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Stab me in my throat?</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Pull your guy out, Mac.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull him out.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull him out, Marvin.</p>
<p>Marvin, I'm gonna pull him out. Okay.</p>
<p>Who's the nerd now, bitch?</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>I feel like a gangster.</p>
<p>Shut up, Gary.</p>
<p>I'm not dropping out.</p>
<p>Bro, you have to drop out.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I didn't wanna say this before, but you don't have Kennedy hair.</p>
<p><em>All right! Oh, God!</p>
<p>You don't have thejawline.</em></p>
<p>How could you say that?</p>
<p>If I hear one more flip-flop out of you...</p>
<p>I'm gonna throw up in my mouth.</p>
<p>You ready to do this?</p>
<p>I'm just doing some fine-tuning.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>Just trying to get my tan on.</p>
<p>Let's hurry.</p>
<p>The battery on this drains like a tub.</p>
<p>What is going on in here?</p>
<p>Are those beach towels?</p>
<p>We're gonna shoot a commercial, get it on public access, get the message out.</p>
<p>It's a million-dollar bill pal.</p>
<p>Yeah. A million-dollar bill.</p>
<p>You guys are never gonna get a bribe.</p>
<p>It's not about the bribe anymore.</p>
<p>We don't care about that.</p>
<p>I could be a legitimate politician.</p>
<p>He's goin' to the top.</p>
<p>Really do some good in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Are you listening to yourself?</p>
<p>You've never done any good for anybody ever!</p>
<p>I do good! I do good!</p>
<p>You never do anything! You're a loser!</p>
<p>You're just jealous!</p>
<p>I'm not jealous!</p>
<p>All right! All right! That's...</p>
<p>That's no way to run a campaign, boys.</p>
<p>Let's have the conversation outside.</p>
<p>All right. We'll talk outside.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll make you happy.</p>
<p>You're droppin' out of that race.</p>
<p><em>We'll work it out.</p>
<p>I'm droppin' out of shit.</em></p>
<p>We'll work it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll work it out. You and me and...</p>
<p><em>Did you just lock this door?</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>You are going to hell, little man!</p>
<p>Mmm, I don't think so.</p>
<p>That's politics, bitch.</p>
<p>I hate you, Charlie!</p>
<p>You ready? - I'm ready. - Goddamn it!</em></p>
<p>Get in front of the flag and the million-dollar bill.</p>
<p>Dude, you and my dad share this futon?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, we... No, we got a whole different situation worked out.</p>
<p>What's the situation?</p>
<p>It's... I sleep on the... And...</p>
<p>You got the script that I wrote?</p>
<p>Grab the script.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to speak to you about this.</p>
<p>I can't read these words.</p>
<p>They're not in the right order.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>I think you might be dyslexic. I'm not readin' this.</p>
<p>No, no! Please. Read it.</p>
<p>I think you might be dyslexic.</p>
<p>Read the script.</p>
<p>You want me to read the script?</p>
<p>Yes. And action.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'll read the words you wrote.</p>
<p>"Hello, fellow American.</p>
<p>"This you should vote me.</p>
<p>"I leave power. Good.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>If you vote me, I am hot." What?</p>
<p>"Taxes. They'll be lower, son.</p>
<p>"The democratic vote for me is right thing to do, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>So do."</p>
<p>This doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Well, then just say whatever you want.</p>
<p>The battery's dead.</p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p>I gotta charge it up again.</p>
<p><em>This one piece is makin'me nervous.</em></p>
<p>You seriously need to stop touching me.</p>
<p>This right here.</p>
<p>Please stop touching me.</p>
<p>This is really ridiculous.</p>
<p>I'm stuffed in here like a jerk.</p>
<p>Deandra, you look sensational.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p><em>Just remember. Let Daddy do all the talkin'.</em></p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>Jack Stanford.</p>
<p>Frank Reynolds.</p>
<p>This here is my daughter, Deandra.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Well, I never like to keep a beautiful woman waiting.</p>
<p>Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p>You see, uh, Mr. Stanford...</p>
<p>I myself am a problem solver... and you got a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm not following.</p>
<p>Check out the goods to my right.</p>
<p>This pretty little lady is not only my daughter.</p>
<p>She happens to be your biggest opponent in the election.</p>
<p>Beauty and the beast.</p>
<p>You're funny.</p>
<p><em>Let the men do the work here, Dee.</p>
<p>Now we can make this problem go away...</em> before it becomes a more expensive problem... if you catch my... drift.</p>
<p>Are you trying to solicit a bribe from me?</p>
<p>I don't know. Am I?</p>
<p>'Cause if you are... not only is that illegal and highly unethical... but you're doing it with the subtlety of a baboon.</p>
<p>Let me take another approach here.</p>
<p>I tell you what.</p>
<p>What...</p>
<p>Why don't we discuss this over dinner?</p>
<p>Dinner. That sounds good.</p>
<p>I was talking to her.</p>
<p>Look, Jack... my little girl don't go nowhere without her old man.</p>
<p>Isn't that right, sweetie?</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p><em>Frank. Frankie, I gotta talk to you.</em></p>
<p>Not interested.</p>
<p>Look, man, I'm in a lot of shit here.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>I need to destroy Dennis.</p>
<p>What do you have in mind?</p>
<p>When Dennis Reynolds was a counselor at Camp Cumberland... he was sent home for the statutory rape of a teenage camper.</p>
<p>A vote for Dennis Reynolds is a vote for underage rape.</p>
<p>Dennis Reynolds... baby rapist.</p>
<p>Don't let him rape you, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This is a goddamn smear campaign.</p>
<p>You raped a girl?</p>
<p>No, no. Okay. rape?</p>
<p><em>I was accused of...</p>
<p>Okay, statutory, first of all.</em></p>
<p>Not... I kissed her.</p>
<p>She was a year younger than me.</p>
<p>That's not... even statutory or anything.</p>
<p>What's the note say?</p>
<p>All right. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Uh, "Meet"...</p>
<p>Starts out "Meet," and then there's, like, other stuff.</p>
<p>"Meet me in the parking garage.</p>
<p>Frank."</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You clearly have a learning disability, dude.</p>
<p>This is a trap.</p>
<p>It's not a trap. Go see what he wants.</p>
<p>It's a trap.</p>
<p>It's not a trap! Make this thing go away.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll get the master.</p>
<p>Did you come alone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where'd you get that trench coat?</p>
<p>It's cool, huh?</p>
<p>It's very cool. That was a smart buy.</p>
<p>All right, you got the tape?</p>
<p>Affirmative.</p>
<p>Okay, what's this gonna take?</p>
<p>You and Dennis gotta bow out of the race.</p>
<p>Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Gotta happen.</p>
<p>Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>I want that tape.</p>
<p>I'm gonna need you to beg.</p>
<p>Don't make me beg.</p>
<p>You gotta beg.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Seriously. Down. Down.</p>
<p>All right. I know what you're talkin' about.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Please, can I have the tape now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>God! Come on, Frank. What's this gonna take?</p>
<p><em>What the hell is that?</em></p>
<p>Charlie traded me his whole collection... of Garbage Pail Kids for the tape.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. This is bad.</p>
<p>This is so bad, man.</p>
<p>These things, Mac...</p>
<p>You don't know how rare they are.</p>
<p>These are rare.</p>
<p>You can't find these.</p>
<p>Bro, I am in some serious shit.</p>
<p>I needed him to drop out.</p>
<p>I don't care what you need.</p>
<p>That is politics, bitch.</p>
<p>I wanna tell you somethin'.</p>
<p>I'm really glad you asked me out.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>How's that drink comin'?</p>
<p>Strong.</p>
<p>I should really probably think about gettin' something to eat.</p>
<p>Yeah. Still got a little left there.</p>
<p>Not for long.</p>
<p>Hey, have mine.</p>
<p>Oh. You're such a gentleman.</p>
<p>Are you gonna buy me some food at some point? Or...</p>
<p>What do you say we get outta here?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Who's the slut?</p>
<p>Honey, this isn't what...</p>
<p>Another one of your whores?</p>
<p>Who do you think you are... Bill Clinton?</p>
<p>You're a comptroller.</p>
<p><em>Did he tell you he had a wife?</em></p>
<p>Did he tell you that, you goddamn whore?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Whoa! Whoa! All right.</p>
<p>You bitch!</em></p>
<p>Hey! Pour me a shot there, buddy boy. I got it.</p>
<p>Oh, what'd you get?</p>
<p>I got the smear tape.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, man. That's great.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Whoa. Sweet Dee.</p>
<p>What the hell's goin' on with you?</p>
<p>Screw politicians.</p>
<p>Charlie, pour me a shot.</p>
<p>No time for that. We gotta get back out on that campaign trail.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Hey, man, I was doin' some thinking about that.</p>
<p>I don't wanna do that anymore.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I googled "comptroller."</p>
<p>Turns out that this guy's really just a glorified accountant.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? And I hate doing math. It sounds like a ton of work.</p>
<p>You know what I'm sayin'? I hate work.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>These guys, they make less than teachers. It's a...</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>So I'm not doing it anymore.</p>
<p>No. You have to run.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Yeah, you do.</em></p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>You're not the boss of me.</p>
<p>I'm the campaign manager.</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>I traded all my Garbage Pail Kids for you.</p>
<p><em>Well, that was stupid.</em></p>
<p>Bit of an overreaction, don't you think?</p>
<p>You look like a whore.</p>
<p>Psst. You come alone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why couldn't we just meet in your apartment?</p>
<p>It's not safe.</p>
<p>Is that Frank's trench coat?</p>
<p>Yeah. Pretty sweet, right?</p>
<p>Totally sweet.</p>
<p>Listen. I need your help.</p>
<p>I'm in a lot of shit.</p>
<p>I'm listening.</p>
<p>I need to make Dennis disappear.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! That's what I'm talkin' about.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I was thinkin' that same thing, man.</p>
<p>That's great. I know you guys have become close.</p>
<p>Not that close.</p>
<p>How do you wanna do this thing?</p>
<p>If we use a gun, we're gonna need a silencer.</p>
<p>A gun?</p>
<p>Fine. No guns. Piano wire.</p>
<p>Maybe we can use some piano wire.</p>
<p>Look, whatever it is...</p>
<p>I gotta be the guy to pull the trigger on this thing.</p>
<p>Retard. I'm talking about taking Dennis to Atlantic City... for a couple of days until the election is over.</p>
<p>What are you talkin' about?</p>
<p>Atlantic City. That's good.</p>
<p>Just take him down to the shore for a couple days.</p>
<p>I'll take him to the shore. We'll go to Atlantic City.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>I give the guy my blood, sweat and tears, right?</p>
<p>And my Garbage Pail Kids.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>And he just drops right out of the race on me.</p>
<p>Dennis dropped out?</p>
<p>He dropped right out of the race.</p>
<p>So I'm out my Garbage Pail Kid...</p>
<p>And, like...</p>
<p>If we used piano wire on him for a sec...</p>
<p>As long as we hurt him a little bit...</p>
<p>Sorry, Charlie. Plan's off.</p>
<p>What are you doin'?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go collect my money.</p>
<p>Looks like you bitches shouldn't have fired me in the first place.</p>
<p>Are you kiddin' me?</p>
<p>Are you kiddin' me with that?</p>
<p>I'm gonna buy myself a car. I am gonna drive as far away from this goddamn city...</p>
<p>Hey, Mac.</p>
<p>Where you runnin' to?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Goin' to visit your friend over at the union?</p>
<p>What's goin' on?</p>
<p>Is there a problem?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Phil, is there a problem?</p>
<p>Conspiracy to solicit a bribe.</p>
<p>Racketeering.</p>
<p>I'd say there's a big problem.</p>
<p>Your buddy over at the union came to see us recently.</p>
<p>Told us about your interest in politics.</p>
<p>He ratted you out, Mac.</p>
<p>Apparently, you called him a nerd, Mac.</p>
<p>Some people don't take kindly to that type of insult.</p>
<p>Yeah. You're goin' away for a long time... and prison can be a very unpleasant place... for a good-lookin' young man like yourself.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. They're gonna tear through you like Kleenex.</p>
<p>That is, of course... unless you got something to make it worth our while.</p>
<p>Are you soliciting a bribe from me?</p>
<p>Sorry, pal. That's politics.</p>
