<p>You're definitely gonna get this on. You ready?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I guess.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He knew that if the gooks were to get their hands on the watch, they would take it.</p>
<p>So he shoved it... up his ass!</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're doing.</p>
<p>Why, it's Christopher Walken!</p>
<p>It sounded like Rosie Perez or something.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>That was a perfect Walken... and it's gonna win me the talent show. What talent show?</p>
<p>The one I throw for the pub crawl. Are you doing that again?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, it's not really a talent show anyway.</p>
<p>She just gets the most untalented people in Philly to enter the competition... so she can win it, and then she never wins it anyway.</p>
<p>No. Last year she got smoked by this chick... who ate, like, 50 hot dogs in three seconds.</p>
<p>That was amazing!</p>
<p>That was not talent.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys! I got some news! Some terrible news!</p>
<p>We got a huge problem. Can we stop for a second and talk about this?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What's with that jacket?</p>
<p>I was gonna wait on that. I think we should go over the jacket now.</p>
<p>No, let's hear about it now.</p>
<p>First of all, it's not a jacket.</p>
<p>It's a duster.</p>
<p>It's like a jacket... only it's longer, thicker and far more badass.</p>
<p>I look like Lorenzo Lamas, and women find it irresistible.</p>
<p>Well, that part's just simply not true. Either way, I like it.</p>
<p>I bought it with the money I was gonna make at the pub crawl.</p>
<p>Here's the problem. You know that Korean barbecue joint down the street?</p>
<p>Mr. Kim's? They just signed up for the pub crawl.</p>
<p>Which means now they're the last stop! They can't be the last stop.</p>
<p>We're always the last stop! That's the only time of year we make any money!</p>
<p>They're also experimenting with a secret microbrew.</p>
<p>Word on the street is that it's delicious and powerful!</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We're the microbrew guys! They can't take that! Wait. You guys have a microbrew?</p>
<p>Yes! We make a delicious, amazing microbrew! Really?</p>
<p>Oh, it's amazing. They-They throw all the skunk beer into a trash can.</p>
<p>And then they sell it for $10 a glass.</p>
<p>The point is we cannot let these Koreans steal our thunder!</p>
<p>They wanna make a top secret microbrew...</p>
<p>We gotta make ours more powerful! Right! We'll make it... so strong that people will pass out and vomit and vomit in their own pass out.</p>
<p>They'll never leave and go to Kim's in the first place!</p>
<p>Yeah. I will make this year's talent show the best talent show ever.</p>
<p>Let the men talk, Dee! Let the men talk! What are you saying?</p>
<p>We're in the middle of an emergency here! Guys, we gotta move on this.</p>
<p>It's the damn North Koreans! Damn North Koreans.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait a second. What makes you guys think they're North Koreans?</p>
<p>That's the bad Korea.</p>
<p>They're the sneaky, bad Korea, man.</p>
<p>The ones on the top and they sneak down and they eat everybody's pets.</p>
<p>I can't stand it! It's un-American! All right, goddamn it.</p>
<p>That's it. They're gonna take our way of life from us. It's bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay, gang. Let's solve this North Korea situation once and for all.</p>
<p>All right, that's enough. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That's enough moonshine, Frank! No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Look, we don't want people to go blind!</p>
<p>You can never have enough moonshine. Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Trust me on this. I know what I'm talking about. How's it taste?</p>
<p>We gotta lace it with somethin' sweeter.</p>
<p>We gotta add a little sweetening. Oh, Deandra.</p>
<p>Could you be a darling and run down and get Daddy some antifreeze?</p>
<p>No. We don't want to kill people. You're not getting this.</p>
<p>I can't help you guys. I have a very busy day. I'm auditioning people all day.</p>
<p>And also, you're not my dad. Winning a talent show that you throw for yourself... is just about the saddest thing you've ever done, Dee.</p>
<p>Listen. If this is all about boosting your self-confidence... why don't you go out and bang a bunch of random dudes like you did in the good old days?</p>
<p>This talent show's very important to me. All right?</p>
<p>And I'm not gonna let you guys steamroll me like you always do.</p>
<p>Why don't you get Charlie and Dennis to help you?</p>
<p>Well, Dennis and Charlie are out collecting intelligence, okay?</p>
<p>Oh! You're playing spies now?</p>
<p>Intel is the name of the game, Dee.</p>
<p>It's all about the intelligence!</p>
<p>Then you picked the wrong two people. Maybe so.</p>
<p>But we do have a secret weapon.</p>
<p>That would've been a lot better if I was wearing the duster, dude.</p>
<p>Come on, dude. It doesn't fit you. It's too big for you.</p>
<p>That's why it's so awesome on me. It's like, "Why's that guy in a giant jacket?</p>
<p>Why do you take this away from me? What is he hiding, dude?"</p>
<p>I just wish you'd let me do it. Can we just snoop around a little bit?</p>
<p>We can snoop around. But I just...</p>
<p>I should be wearing the duster.</p>
<p>That's the bottom line. No, I'm wearing the duster. That's the end of it.</p>
<p>Fine. We should drink a couple of these microbrews.</p>
<p>Let's get some microbrews. That's what people on the pub crawl are gonna do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Two microbrews, please.</p>
<p>All right. What is this? "Pub Crawl Karaoke Contest"? Uhoh.</p>
<p>Bro, "Prize... $500"?</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>Aw, shit. Look at that bracket. Do you think that's...</p>
<p>That's what that's for? Oh, that's for the karaoke contest, bro.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude. There's a lot of names on there. That's huge, man.</p>
<p>That's gonna... Bracketing is a very intricate and difficult thing to do, man.</p>
<p>They got it down. I gotta get this intel back to Mac.</p>
<p>Well, don't... Hold on that because we want to try the... What?</p>
<p>The microbeers?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. That's good.</p>
<p>That is really good.</p>
<p>That's...</p>
<p>That is...</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch, that's good.</p>
<p>They're putting somethin' in that...</p>
<p>'cause you can't just make beer like that. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like they're enriching it?</p>
<p>Are they enriching the...</p>
<p>You cannot...</p>
<p>They're enriching the beers, Charlie. They're enriching their beer.</p>
<p>That's definitely enriched beer.</p>
<p>That's an enriched beer, dude.</p>
<p>That's not conven... I've only tried enriched beer like once, I think.</p>
<p>They're not allowed to have the capabilities to enrich beer here.</p>
<p>Where are they enriching...</p>
<p>What is going on in this place?</p>
<p>Look at all these people, man. They're like, uh... Oh, there's like brainwash...</p>
<p>They're being brainwashed. Notice how they're all happy and smiling...</p>
<p>'cause they're drinking enrich...</p>
<p>How old was that bartender?</p>
<p>Was she 16 or 60? You can't tell. You have no Idea.</p>
<p>They're timeless. They're endless and timeless.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Damn it, dude. We are in big trouble here, man.</p>
<p>Oh, shit! Look at that door, dude. See that door right there?</p>
<p>The one marked "pirate"? You think a pirate lives in there?</p>
<p>I see a door marked "private. " Is that the... Is that the door you were talkin' about?</p>
<p>No, I was talking a...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I didn't say...</p>
<p>No, you s...</p>
<p>What did you hear?</p>
<p>I heard you say you saw a door marked "pirate. "</p>
<p>And "Is there a pirate living in there?" Yes, that's why you thought...</p>
<p>No. See, that's... Why would there be a pirate living in a Korean restaurant?</p>
<p>Are we gonna talk about pirates all day?</p>
<p>Or we gonna find out who lives in there?</p>
<p>You're the one that... All right. Jesus Christ, man.</p>
<p>Here we go. What's wrong? Come on, open it.</p>
<p>It's locked.</p>
<p>All right...</p>
<p>I'm gonna try this out. What...</p>
<p>What is that? Your apartment key?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm gonna see if it's gonna work here. That's not gonna work!</p>
<p>Why not? We're not at your apartment, shithead!</p>
<p>How many possible lock combinations can there be? Oh, so many, dude!</p>
<p>Like hundreds of millions. Well, eventually they're gonna overlap.</p>
<p>They're not ever gonna over... You know what? You're right. It's not working.</p>
<p>Oh, no shit. No shit.</p>
<p>It was worth a try.</p>
<p>It was not worth a try.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Move over. I'm gonna, like, kick the door or some shit.</p>
<p>You're gonna kick it?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Damn, dude. This thing is like...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Enriched in its own way. All right.</p>
<p>Let me try something else here.</p>
<p>Try a spin kick. Try a spin kick. Spin kick?</p>
<p>Yeah. You think you can do it? I'm not even sure...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sons of... All right, I'm gonna kick. You ram. Go!</p>
<p>Nice. Good.</p>
<p>How is that not working?</p>
<p>No, I don't know.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm all right.</p>
<p>All right, we're gonna do that some more.</p>
<p>But let's get some more of that enriched beer.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. I'm gonna call Mac and give him the intel.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>All right, see what else you can find out, and call me back. Good work.</p>
<p>Forget the microbrew.</p>
<p>What's the intel?</p>
<p>They're having a karaoke contest.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>I'm elevating us to threat level yellow. It's time.</p>
<p>Yellow?</p>
<p>Yeah. It's time.</p>
<p>What were we before?</p>
<p>Orange, of course.</p>
<p>Orange is much more threatening than yellow!</p>
<p>No, that's an old system.</p>
<p>It doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Clearly yellow... You go from yellow to orange to red!</p>
<p>Yellow is more threatening than orange! Frank, this is orange!</p>
<p>Have you seen this?</p>
<p>Yellow, orange, red!</p>
<p>This is yellow! See this?</p>
<p>Red, red!</p>
<p>Is this more threatening?</p>
<p>Yellow, orange, red!</p>
<p>It's backwards going to yellow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Elevate...</p>
<p>Color fight. Listen.</p>
<p>I need you monkeys outta here 'cause my contestants are waiting.</p>
<p>That's a no can do, and I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>The Koreans have escalated the conflict. So I've upgraded us to yellow.</p>
<p>I don't know what that means. It means we're taking over the talent show.</p>
<p>What? No, you're not!</p>
<p>It's already done.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>I knew it. I told you.</p>
<p>You're trying to steamroll me. It's not gonna work. Go on.</p>
<p>I'm gonna win this competition. There's nothing you guys can do about it.</p>
<p>You're not even gonna be in it, Dee. You have to face facts.</p>
<p>You have no talent.</p>
<p>You're talentless, sweetie.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Oh, is that so?</p>
<p>Why don't you take a gander at this?</p>
<p>No, Mookie. I don't wanna do it. It's too hot outside.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Rosie Perez!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's terrible. Oh, come on! You love that one!</p>
<p>You know what, Dee?</p>
<p>You're a judge. That's it.</p>
<p>Dee's gonna be a judge. And you know why?</p>
<p>Because sitting in judgment of other people is the greatest way to make yourself feel better.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>And go.</p>
<p>All right, again.</p>
<p>And go. You might have to give me the duster back.</p>
<p>It's not working, man.</p>
<p>Aw, it'll work. Go!</p>
<p>All right, it's not working, dude. All right, okay.</p>
<p>I gotta use your head or something. All right, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Hold me sideways and use my head like a battering ram.</p>
<p>All right. Now pick me up off the ground, okay?</p>
<p>Why are you people ruining my door?</p>
<p>Yes! Good! Hello!</p>
<p>All right. Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you the owner?</p>
<p>I owner. I Mr. Kim.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay, good. Well, Mr...</p>
<p>Wait. You say Mr. Kim?</p>
<p>Yes! I Mr. Kim!</p>
<p>Wow. You should really do something different with your hair because...</p>
<p>Yeah. You're not coming across at all like a man to me.</p>
<p>You don't look or seem like a man. Look...</p>
<p>If you don't tell us what's in that microbrew, so help me, God... we will send you people back to the Stone Age.</p>
<p>I no respond to bully!</p>
<p>What are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p>You're messin' with the wrong country, pal!</p>
<p>That's an act of aggression right there, buddy!</p>
<p>Every Asian know martial arts? They have to learn it when they grow up.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>It's like school.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Okay!</p>
<p>Oh, God. Jesus! That guy is such a dickhead!</p>
<p>You don't have to take that from him. I hope you know that.</p>
<p>If I don't do what he say, he punish me!</p>
<p>He terrible man, okay? Always, "Work, work, work!" He treat me like slave!</p>
<p>Slave?</p>
<p>Slave? He's got slaves?</p>
<p>He's has slaves in there? What kind of a communist dictatorship... is this piece of shit running?</p>
<p>Hey, I no phone, no TV!</p>
<p>I not even allowed to drink the beer!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No! That is not acceptable!</p>
<p>You're mad about the beer thing? I'm v... I'm ver...</p>
<p>Are you not mad about the beer thing? Yeah. Of course I am.</p>
<p>Look, you should be able to drink beer. That's what happens in America.</p>
<p>Yeah. In America, you can...</p>
<p>You can drink beer. Look.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. You come down to Paddy's Pub, all right?</p>
<p>We'll let you drink all the beer you want.</p>
<p>You can smoke your cigarettes.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You won't have to deal with the trash 'cause I deal with the trash.</p>
<p>You do trash?</p>
<p>He takes out the trash.</p>
<p>Me trash.</p>
<p>He captures the rats.</p>
<p>You beer, me trash, okay? I beer, you trash!</p>
<p>I trash, yes!</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Holy shit, bro.</p>
<p>Did you just see that?</p>
<p>Yeah. She made a meaningful gesture towards me.</p>
<p>She made... No, dude.</p>
<p>She was gesturing to me.</p>
<p>I had my arm out like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, why were you doing that?</p>
<p>'Cause she extended to me.</p>
<p>And then there was stuff in the eyes between us.</p>
<p>And my arm was at her.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sure, pal.</p>
<p>Wha...</p>
<p>But the dog was buried by the bright sunlight And the old man died In his sleep last night And the young girl never did get...</p>
<p>All right! All right! All right!</p>
<p>That's enough. That's enough. Thank you.</p>
<p>Well... Martha, you are terrible.</p>
<p>I wanted to pluck out my eyes and jam them into my ears.</p>
<p>I wanted to pummel you with a manhole cover.</p>
<p>There is no point to you.</p>
<p>Oh, no...</p>
<p>Sweetie, I thought you were really talented.</p>
<p>And I liked it, what you had on your fingers.</p>
<p>And your hair is so...</p>
<p>It's like it has a bulb on the front of it.</p>
<p>It just wasn't happening for me, dog. I mean...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, dog. I was not...</p>
<p>It was the finger cymbals need work.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>And the jewelry and everything just...</p>
<p>It was...</p>
<p>It was just okay, dog.</p>
<p>Is it a yes or no, Frank?</p>
<p>It's gotta be no, dog.</p>
<p>Dee? Oh, I just think you're so full of magic.</p>
<p>You're like a big, round wizard.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, it's a no from me.</p>
<p>So... off you go, Martha.</p>

<p>Why did you get so drunk?</p>
<p>You got drunk!</p>
<p>I'm just really exhausted.</p>
<p>What's in that cup?</p>
<p>Rum and Cokes. Why are you getting wasted?</p>
<p>Maybe because you dicks stole my talent show.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how important this is? "You have any idea... "</p>
<p>We're trying to save the pub crawl.</p>
<p>Really? This is what you're doing?</p>
<p>You know what's gonna happen if the North Koreans take over?</p>
<p>They're gonna ruin our way of life! Get your shit together, dog!</p>
<p>Next!</p>

<p>Hello there, Dennis.</p>
<p>It's Charlie.</p>
<p>How you doin'? Hey, you're never gonna guess who showed up at my...</p>
<p>That's a very good guess. Congratulations.</p>
<p>But the point is that I have defeated you... at this little game of hearts and... and minds so that...</p>
<p>No, don't come over. No, dude. I don't want you to come over, dude.</p>
<p>Don't c...</p>
<p>Dennis, don't come over.</p>
<p>D... Well, then why... No, I'm not scared. I just don't want you comin'...</p>
<p>Goddamn it! No! Why did I call him?</p>
<p>Good evening. I need to speak to Mr. Kim, please.</p>
<p>I Mr. Kim.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Uh, Mr. Kim, my name is...</p>
<p>R Rita F-Fire... s.</p>
<p>Hmm, Fires. And I am from the National Health Inspectors...</p>
<p>Uh, Store.</p>
<p>And I need to...</p>
<p>I need to make sure that your secret microbrew is up to code.</p>
<p>Health inspector?</p>
<p>Hmm. Oh, you bet your ass, Kim.</p>
<p>Okay, all right!</p>
<p>I just... God!</p>
<p>I just want your stupid recipe!</p>
<p>You... terrible actress.</p>
<p>Wait! Okay.</p>
<p>Hmm, I'll sleep with you.</p>
<p>Your breath smell like vomit.</p>
<p>Okay, but...</p>
<p>I know recipe.</p>
<p>You do? Well, what...</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Offer still stand?</p>
<p>All right. Where is she? Ah, dude, you might as well turn right back around, man.</p>
<p>'Cause she's in love with me, dude. Uh, yeah, I doubt that.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>We have so much in common, you're not gonna believe. What?</p>
<p>Uh, we both like pizza.</p>
<p>Pizza!</p>
<p>Well, I like pizza.</p>
<p>Everybody loves pizza.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>We both hate mean people.</p>
<p>Who likes mean people?</p>
<p>We don't like mean people.</p>
<p>Well, neither do I.</p>
<p>Well, we both think kissing's gross.</p>
<p>How is kissing gross? You know, we just don't like it.</p>
<p>We're not into it, you know?</p>
<p>Probably, it's... Sticky.</p>
<p>Is it sticky? It's, like, there's candy and beer in your mouth.</p>
<p>How is it sticky? From candy and beer? I don't know.</p>
<p>This is bullshit. Clearly there's some kind of language barrier thing happening here.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna go ahead and pop this shirt off and finish this thing once and for all, Charles.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>He smell like dog fart.</p>
<p>Eww!</p>
<p>She says you smell like a dog fart.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? All right, take It off. Take It off for us.</p>
<p>Dog fart, huh?</p>
<p>Am I in America?</p>
<p>Ladies.</p>
<p>Nice turnout, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I'm getting a little nervous here, Frank.</p>
<p>I've heard some rumblings about Mr. Kim's, okay? We gotta keep these people here.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Mac.</p>
<p>I got a plan.</p>
<p>Mac, I got problems, man.</p>
<p>I can see that. Why are you wearing the duster with no shirt?</p>
<p>I'm trying to get my mojo back.</p>
<p>Charlie and I have been competing... over the same Korean chick, and he's like totally winning.</p>
<p>Why are you wearing my duster with no shirt?</p>
<p>This is the perfect combination. Do I really have to explain this to you, bro?</p>
<p>Yes! Explain it to me. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Black leather duster... tough, muscular dude underneath it, inside of it. Very sexual.</p>
<p>Check this out. Check this out. What's with the hose?</p>
<p>Hang on. I'm gonna spray it on the women's tops.</p>
<p>We get a better look at their talents if their shirts are wet.</p>
<p>Wet T-shirt contest. I like that. Wait, Frank. Frank.</p>
<p>How are we gonna have a wet T-shirt contest without girls?</p>
<p>We never got any contestants. We can use the girls that are here.</p>
<p>They don't even know they're contestants.</p>
<p>You can't just blast people with a hose in a bar. They will leave.</p>
<p>Lock the door. No, that's not gonna work.</p>
<p>Frank, go get your gun.</p>
<p>Perfect. Go over to Mr. Kim.</p>
<p>Convince him to close for the day.</p>
<p>I can do that. Oh, excuse us! Excuse us, please.</p>
<p>Excuse us!</p>
<p>Heyoh!</p>
<p>Heyoh!</p>
<p>I love when you say it!</p>
<p>We are so happy.</p>
<p>And do you know why?</p>
<p>We just got engaged.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>You guys just got engaged?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now we're engaged.</p>
<p>All right, do you want to have some champagne?</p>
<p>Yes. We're gonna have some champagne to celebrate this.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Champagne!</p>
<p>Did you guys happen to catch what Sun-Li was wearing? White tank top.</p>
<p>A white tank top. Exactly. I was thinking we could talk Charlie... into having her enter the wet T-shirt contest. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We'll tell him it's all a part of Dee's talent show.</p>
<p>Right. When she jumps up on the stage, we'll blast her with the water.</p>
<p>The crowd will go crazy. The other girls are gonna want to join in.</p>
<p>And we will save the bar. And then she'll break up with Charlie... ruining any hopes for happiness that that son of a bitch ever had.</p>
<p>I agree with the first part. But the second part seems incredibly harsh.</p>
<p>That's the best goddamn part!</p>
<p>Look, you guys deal with that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go take care of Mr. Kim.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you want...</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>What the hell is this? Oh, only Mr. Kim's secret microbrew recipe.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>It's in Korean. What am I supposed to do with this?</p>
<p>Maybe I can get Sun-Li to translate it for us.</p>
<p>Sun-Li? Hi. Could you read this for us, please?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>"Bony American is dirty, dirty whore.</p>
<p>She bring much shame to herself and country. "</p>
<p>Great. Good work, Dee. Yeah. You really topped yourself this year, Sis.</p>
<p>Charlie, can we talk to you for a sec?</p>
<p>You whore?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>What you want? I'm gonna have to ask you to shut this place down.</p>
<p>I am shut down. Look around, you jerk! No one here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was kinda wondering about that. What's up?</p>
<p>My daughter, Sun-Li... she is missing!</p>
<p>Korean broad?</p>
<p>You seen her?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Oh, she no come home last night!</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure she's gonna come back. She probably just met some guy.</p>
<p>What you talking about?</p>
<p>You sick freak!</p>
<p>Sun-Li only 12 years old!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She just 12-year-old girl!</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Attention, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, attention. Our first contestant halls from North Korea.</p>
<p>That's right, North Korea, everybody.</p>
<p>She's gonna be doing something or other.</p>
<p>And then we're gonna blast her with water from a hose.</p>
<p>It's gonna be great, right? You're gonna want to stick around for this.</p>
<p>And listen, ladies, if you wanna get in on this action, please do not hesitate to do so.</p>
<p>Okay, take it away.</p>
<p>All set.</p>
<p>Uh, wait a second.</p>
<p>You're gonna blast my fiancée with water, exposing her breasts to this entire crowd?</p>
<p>Yeah, man. Is that cool? That's very cool.</p>
<p>Awesome. All right, Sun-Li, hit it!</p>
<p>Oh, Great Leader we come to enjoy you You make sun and moon In the sky The earth is spinning because of your laughter All right, she's bombing.</p>
<p>Blast her. All righty.</p>
<p>All right, everybody!</p>
<p>Three, two...</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>Oh, God! Come on, Frank!</p>
<p>What are you doing, Frank?</p>
<p>Son of a bitch! The wet T-shirt contest is off!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>She's only 12 years old!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're just 12?</p>
<p>Twelve, Charlie!</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>That actually explains a lot.</p>
<p>Wait. Where are you guys going?</p>
<p>You guys don't have to leave!</p>
<p>No, stay, drink! We didn't know she was 12.</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Well, there goes the pub crawl. Oh, son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Well, I feel better about myself.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Uh, all I did was sleep with... a toothless, oily busboy for a recipe.</p>
<p>Charlie banged a 12 year old. No, I didn't.</p>
<p>What? Yeah. I didn't even kiss that girl.</p>
<p>Like, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. I can't believe you banged a toothless busboy.</p>
<p>Those goddamn North Koreans.</p>
<p>They are some sneaky bastards.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
