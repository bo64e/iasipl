<p>6:57, 6:58, 6:59. Seven minutes. Keep going, buddy.</p>
<p>Frank, you seeing this? I'm working on the chicken parts over here.</p>
<p>Forget the chicken parts. Charlie is about to shatter the world record... for holding his breath... he's up to seven minutes.</p>
<p>Take the buns off the radiator. Forget the buns. We are gonna be world famous after this.</p>
<p>Charlie, how you doing?</p>
<p>I gotta breathe, man.</p>
<p>No, Charlie, don't breathe! One more minute! Buns are gonna burn!</p>
<p>Don't do that!</p>
<p>Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!</p>
<p>Come on! Are you breathing?</p>
<p>Of course I'm breathing!</p>
<p>Well, you ruined it. We could have been famous. We could have been famous.</p>
<p>Come in!</p>
<p>Hi. I... Oh, I'm, uh...</p>
<p>What do you want, lady?</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Uh, my name is Betty Canuso, and I don't know if you heard... but a week ago, Eastern State Correctional Facility was forced to release...</p>
<p>25% of its inmates due to overcrowding.</p>
<p>Eastern State? That's where my dad is. Maybe they let my dad out. Did they let my dad out?</p>
<p>How would I know that?</p>
<p>Listen, I'm here because of a man named Wendell Albright, a registered sex offender.</p>
<p>He's moved into this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm hoping by raising awareness we can force him out of the neighborhood... and away from our children, you know, once and for all. It's going on and on.</p>
<p>Is there something that you need from us?</p>
<p>Because we're in the middle of something.</p>
<p>Please post these flyers anywhere you can.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>All right. Okay. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Out. Get out. Get out.</p>
<p>Some people have no sense... of my personal boundaries and property. Let's set the shit up again.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>This dude looks just like Dennis.</p>
<p>I do not look like this guy.</p>
<p>Are you serious, dude? What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>He's, like, 40 years old. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Look at his jaw. Look at his jawline.</p>
<p>His jaw is exactly where I don't look like him. His jaw is fat and it's...</p>
<p>Go, like, this far back. I never go that far back. When I do, it doesn't do that.</p>
<p>I give you six to eight months before you start looking exactly like that guy.</p>
<p>That's crazy, man.</p>
<p>There's no resemblance...</p>
<p>Hello. Dad. They did let you out. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Don't touch me. Right. That's how it goes. Hey, hey, come meet my friends.</p>
<p>Guys, this is my dad.</p>
<p>Well, Charlie you know.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, man.</p>
<p>Hey, by the way... real sorry about that whole heroin incident in the butt, but here's the deal.</p>
<p>I had my butt filled like a Christmas stocking, and I wanted to come...</p>
<p>I got a little nervous, everything came flushing out of me.</p>
<p>Wendell "Shorteyes."</p>
<p>They let you out too, huh?</p>
<p>What? No, I'm not Wendell "Shorteyes. " Didn't I stab you once?</p>
<p>No, you never stabbed... Look, I'm not Wendell, okay? I'm not a sexual child molester.</p>
<p>I'm Dennis Reynolds. I'm handsome and chiseled and...</p>
<p>Now you got me thinking. I gotta go look in a mirror.</p>
<p>Dad, what are you gonna do now that you're out? I need a job.</p>
<p>Well, tell you what. I just got an idea. Bouncer. Welcome aboard, buddy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Good thinking.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you for a second, you guys?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Dude, Dee, that guy really likes your hair.</p>
<p>Yeah, he does. This is a very bad plan. What? Which one?</p>
<p>This man should not work here. Why are you attacking us?</p>
<p>This guy looks like he wants to eat me.</p>
<p>Has he ever eaten anybody that you know of?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>No. But it'd be pretty cool if he did. Yeah, that is really cool.</p>
<p>Think about the dedication you got to put into eating a human body.</p>
<p>If he's got that kind of commitment, imagine what...</p>
<p>Son, where's the telephone?</p>
<p>Do you have plans, Dad?</p>
<p>'Cause I was thinking we could do some father-son stuff. Have a catch. Talk.</p>
<p>No, I'm not gonna do that.</p>
<p>But I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Here's a list of, uh, all the people I, uh, promised to visit after I got out of prison.</p>
<p>Maybe you can drive me around, help me take care of a few of 'em, hmm?</p>
<p>Take care of a few of 'em?</p>
<p>Okay, that sounds cool.</p>
<p>You got a car? No. Dennis does, but he won't give me the keys.</p>
<p>That won't be a problem.</p>
<p>I do not want Mac's dad working at our bar.</p>
<p>I was looking in the mirror, and I gotta tell you, looks pretty good in here.</p>
<p>Jawline looks good... Are you listening to me? I don't want to get eaten.</p>
<p>Eaten? He eats people? That's awesome. That's not awesome.</p>
<p>Why do you guys think that eating people is awesome? It just is.</p>
<p>asshole!</p>
<p>What? Did you see that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that. Listen, I need your help, okay?</p>
<p>You're part owner of the bar, and you're probably the only person that Mac listens to... and I need you talk to him... Dee, you're blowing this completely out of proportion.</p>
<p>Mac's dad probably hasn't seen a woman in a very long time.</p>
<p>And as soon as he comes across one that's actually attractive... he's gonna forget all about you, just like every other man does. Why do you do that?</p>
<p>Pervert!</p>
<p>Dickhead!</p>
<p>Pervert? Dickhead? Why are people yelling at me in the streets, Dee?</p>
<p>Could have something to do with that.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's gonna be a problem for me.</p>
<p>Take the TV too. Frank! What the hell's going on in here, man?</p>
<p>I'm leaving. It's been great, but I got to get something more out of my life.</p>
<p>Well, why are you taking all my shit?</p>
<p>Well, it was really hard to tell whose was whose, so I just decided to take everything.</p>
<p>You don't ever use this.</p>
<p>I use that all the time.</p>
<p>It's like the only thing I use. All right, slow down, Frank. Slow down.</p>
<p>What the hell's this all about?</p>
<p>Charlie, I need a woman. I need a woman to cook for me and clean up after me... and somebody who'll do everything I say.</p>
<p>That's just a maid.</p>
<p>You want a maid? Yeah.</p>
<p>That's right. A maid.</p>
<p>A maid I can bang.</p>
<p>Well, what the hell, man? I mean... What?</p>
<p>I thought we had a pretty sweet thing going on here. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>We had a good deal going on. We hung out.</p>
<p>We... Breakin' records, eatin' chicken scraps.</p>
<p>I know you're gonna miss me. Don't hug me!</p>
<p>Get... Get out of my apartment. Dude, I don't need you. No, wait, wait.</p>
<p>You know what, dude? Before you go, remember one thing.</p>
<p>We had about the sweetest life that two men can have together, and you're walking out on that.</p>
<p>Charlie, you're gonna have to deal with it. You know why?</p>
<p>Because I need that bang maid.</p>
<p>All right. But you're not gonna do very well out there without this guy.</p>
<p>'Cause I may not be much, Frank, but, uh, I think you'll find that I'm a pretty sweet deal... once you're out there on your own, and I'll tell you what else.</p>
<p>You're not gonna find a bang maid, 'cause there's no such thing.</p>
<p>I already did.</p>
<p>Your mom. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Okay, let's go.</p>
<p>It's been about 30 minutes, Dad.</p>
<p>What were you doing up there?</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh, just, uh, keeping up with my, uh, correspondence.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds nice.</p>
<p>How'd it go?</p>
<p>Well, there was a bit of a struggle, but, uh... it turned out just fine.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Good. So, um... Hey, I was thinking we could hang out, you know.</p>
<p>I was thinking we could go on a double date.</p>
<p>Go onto Match. Com, find us a couple of hot ladies. What do you think?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No. Okay. Ooh!</p>
<p>We could go on a road trip. Hey, Dad, let's go to Cooperstown, New York.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to go to the Baseball Hall of Fame with my dad.</p>
<p>Do you want to do that with me, Dad? Start the car.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'll start the car. That's fine.</p>
<p>Um, just school me again here.</p>
<p>Is it the yellow one to the black one, or is there orange involved?</p>
<p>Red.</p>
<p>Red. Just red.</p>
<p>There we go. Teamwork, right?</p>
<p>A little father-son teamwork.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Put on your seat belt.</p>
<p>Or don't. Here we go.</p>
<p>It looks great.</p>
<p>Stop fiddling with it.</p>
<p>I know it looks great. I just want to make sure the glue holds.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a twofold operation. We want to prove that you're not Wendell Albright... but prove that you are a good guy. Good guy?</p>
<p>Check. That comes naturally for me. Great. Now step one.</p>
<p>This guy's a little paunchy, right?</p>
<p>You're not. You got a great body.</p>
<p>But how are we supposed to see that with this billowy shirt you got on? Pop that thing off.</p>
<p>Whoa. Wait a second, Dee. I can't just pop my shirt off in the middle of a park. You crazy?</p>
<p>I feel like you're not using your head.</p>
<p>What better way to differentiate you from this fatty than by showing off this amazing body?</p>
<p>There is an amazing body under this shirt.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pop the shirt off. I need to show it.</p>
<p>This is what I'm thinking. You go over there and put on a fitness clinic for these kids.</p>
<p>Show that you care about their physical body.</p>
<p>I care about the kids. I would never hurt the kids, but I care about them.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I'm gonna go do that right now.</p>
<p>Take a lap.</p>
<p>Work those monkey bars.</p>
<p>Hey, fellas. Hi, there.</p>
<p>I am working with a program that assimilates convicted child molesters... right back into your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Kids, how you doing today? It's a beautiful, sunny day, isn't it?</p>
<p>Here, gather around for a second. I want to talk to you kids about physical fitness.</p>
<p>Now we're not responsible for making sure these people are rehabilitated... but this guy's done his time and he deserves a second chance, don't you think?</p>
<p>That's him right over there talking to your kids.</p>
<p>Yeah. Nice and high over that bar so you can work those muscles.</p>
<p>'Cause you want your muscles to pop, you understand? You see how these pecs, they're popping?</p>
<p>Take a real close look at this body.</p>
<p>This body is chiseled. This body is...</p>
<p>You guys have a great day. Some people In society aren't very muscular.</p>
<p>You should notice the difference.</p>
<p>Let me show you another hamstring stretch. This is a real good one.</p>
<p>You're gonna make your legs into a "V." Just like that.</p>
<p>You're gonna put your hands together and stretch out nice and low.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to stick your ass out.</p>
<p>That's not embarrassing. It's a good thing.</p>
<p>Get those hamstrings nice and loose. That's a real... Hey, pervert.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>A dinner party?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, Frank, it's gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>Everybody's gonna be there.</p>
<p>My mom, my dad, Charlie.</p>
<p>No, Mac, I don't think I'm ever gonna leave this place.</p>
<p>Nail clippings on command. Massages and hand jobs being thrown around like hotcakes.</p>
<p>This is a party in your honor.</p>
<p>We are celebrating your new relationship.</p>
<p>Can I bring my bang maid?</p>
<p>Of course, dude. You can bring anybody you want.</p>
<p>Bonnie!</p>
<p>Oh, uh, yes, Frank?</p>
<p>Stop making lasagna.</p>
<p>We're goin' out tonight.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay, Frank.</p>
<p>She's in.</p>
<p>All right, I'll see you tonight at 8:00. And the trap is set.</p>
<p>Sweet, bro.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Siphoning boxed wine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why? Bro, this is the perfect plan, man.</p>
<p>Dude, if we get your dad drunk enough, he's gonna be able to see past your mother's looks... past her skin, all that eczema and shit.</p>
<p>He's gonna fall in love with her all over again, buddy.</p>
<p>Now my mom, she gets so belligerent and mean when she's drunk, dude... she's gonna drive Frank right back into my arms. Into your arms?</p>
<p>Into my... Into my home.</p>
<p>Into my futon and my house...</p>
<p>I'm gonna have Frank back is what I'm trying to say, dude.</p>
<p>Right. Where'd all these jars come from?</p>
<p>I emptied out all the tomato sauce.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Seems to me like it'd be easier to steal the box than jars of liquid.</p>
<p>No. No. The jars are...</p>
<p>It's easier... You empty...</p>
<p>Where were you 10 minutes ago when I was coming up with this plan, man?</p>
<p>Okay, I helped you. In fact, I'm still helping you.</p>
<p>I'm giving you ice for your broken face, so you call Mac now.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You helped me get my ass kicked.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think you did that on purpose.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, how dare you say it.</p>
<p>You call Mac right now.</p>
<p>No. I'm not calling Mac.</p>
<p>No. I'm not calling Mac... because you're not helping me with this molester situation.</p>
<p>I'm gonna call Mac's dad, tell him you're available, that you were asking about him.</p>
<p>All right, fine. I'll help you. But then right afterwards, you're helping me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>dick.</p>
<p>Oh, Mom, you're gonna look so good for your date.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>I think that should just about do it.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Can't see the TV.</p>
<p>Right. I was thinking maybe you could lay off the TV, just for an hour...</p>
<p>Can't see the TV. Mac, can I talk to you in here for a second?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll-I'll be right back, okay? Okay, what's up?</p>
<p>Do me a favor, 'cause I'm really in the weeds here, bro.</p>
<p>I need you to take some of these spaghetti sauce things with all the wine in them...</p>
<p>I need you to, like, empty all... What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I am trying to set the right mood in there. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I'm the only one in here! I'm the only one cooking! Is that my problem, Charlie?</p>
<p>What if we have no ambience? Do you have any idea what it takes to cook...</p>
<p>Do you want flat ambience?</p>
<p>Get out of my kitchen!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Charlie. Jesus Christ. This is a disaster!</p>
<p>This disaster's on your hands, not mine, okay? Whoa! Dad. When did you get here?</p>
<p>Shh. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, surprise, Mom.</p>
<p>Surprise! Yea! It's Dad. You guys haven't seen each other in so long, huh? It's exciting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Hey, Dad. Dad, doesn't Mom look pretty?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Here we go. Our guests have arrived.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Almost, uh, touched you again.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, you guys ready? Are you ready?</p>
<p>All right, you look ready. Let's do it.</p>
<p>It's all happening. Hello.</p>
<p>HI.</p>
<p>Welcome. Welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You look good.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Can I take your coats?</p>
<p>Bonnie, coat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Sit.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Damn, dude.</p>
<p>Harsh, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. I think so too. The woman prefers to be treated like shit.</p>
<p>I ain't never seen anything like it in my life.</p>
<p>Attention, everybody! Attention, everyone! Your dinner is served.</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Pipe down.</p>
<p>This is, uh, delicious, Charlie.</p>
<p>Why, thank you, Mac. It's crap. Pure, unadulterated crap.</p>
<p>Uh, Mother, how's yours?</p>
<p>Um... it's crap... pure, unadulterated crap.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not surprised you're saying that, considering I took a crap in yours.</p>
<p>No, he didn't. He's joking. He's joking.</p>
<p>Charlie did not crap into anybody's food, okay?</p>
<p>Mother, you might be wanting to have some more of this turkey sangria, wash that crap down.</p>
<p>No. Bonnie.</p>
<p>She doesn't want any more.</p>
<p>Shut up, Frank. You don't know what she wants any more than she knows what you want.</p>
<p>You know who knows what you want? I do. I've always known what you want.</p>
<p>And I can give you want you want.</p>
<p>Just let me give you what you want.</p>
<p>I don't think so, Charlie. I don't think so. Let's change the subject.</p>
<p>Dad. Dad, maybe you want to regale us with a story from prison or my childhood?</p>
<p>Mmmmm.</p>
<p>Oh, my. You were in prison?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's very interesting, Luther. Now that you and my mother are opening a dialogue here...</p>
<p>I don't know if you've taken any time out of your dinner to notice her ample breasts.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>The man's been in prison a long time. He probably needs a woman.</p>
<p>What you may or may not have known Is my mother happens to be... one hell of a whore of a man-stealing woman!</p>
<p>Charlie, that's just rude.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Charlie?</p>
<p>It's okay, because my dad already has a woman, Frank. Uh, you have Mom.</p>
<p>She hates me. That's not true. That's not true.</p>
<p>Mom, you don't hate Dad, do you? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Damn it. Mother, I don't know if you know this or not... but Luther happens to be a very successful drug dealer. Oh.</p>
<p>This might appeal to the whore in you.</p>
<p>He happens to have beautiful blue eyes... that just pop right out of his head.</p>
<p>I don't blink. The man doesn't blink, Mom. The man doesn't blink.</p>
<p>Stay away from my bang maid. Damn it, Frank! This isn't about them...</p>
<p>Charlie... or Mac or anyone else... this is about you and me, bro.</p>
<p>This is about dudes living together, hanging out, sharing their bed and their life...</p>
<p>No. That's not what this is about!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>This is about people meeting back up after many years and sparks flying... and families getting back together and raising little boys so they can be happy again!</p>
<p>Okay, happy boys! This is about happy boys!</p>
<p>Bonnie, I'll call you sometime.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Oh, that's it! That's it!</p>
<p>Ah, it's on! You've ruined this, and I'll never forgive you.</p>
<p>We're out of here. I will never forgive you.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You'll forgive me.</p>
<p>Mmm! And the seed is planted.</p>
<p>All right, listen, douche bag... apparently people think we look alike... personally, I don't see it.</p>
<p>Holy shit! No. Yeah, I see that. We got the same eyes, same nose, same lips, same...</p>
<p>And the chin.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>That's what it is. It's all in here is the same. Same jawline and chin...</p>
<p>But look at his whole neck parts.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's right in here.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. It's all there.</p>
<p>What? Who are you here to help? But look at his-his...</p>
<p>I have a chiseled, noble...</p>
<p>That's not the point.</p>
<p>The point is you got to leave so I can live my life in peace. Listen, pal.</p>
<p>This is a pretty sweet situation I got going here. You're out there looking like me... taking all my heat while I'm in here watching the Disney channel all day long.</p>
<p>Why the hell would I move?</p>
<p>We were afraid it might come to that.</p>
<p>Timmy, could you come out here for a second?</p>
<p>Timmy, will you recite for our husky friend here the little courtroom speech we prepared.</p>
<p>I have a friend.</p>
<p>His name Is Wendell.</p>
<p>He showed me funny movies with fully naked people in them.</p>
<p>He gives me juice boxes that make me sleepy.</p>
<p>All right, I get it. He's silly. He's a tickle monster.</p>
<p>Listen, kid, I said I get it, okay?</p>
<p>He makes me taste things I don't want to. He puts things in my heinie.</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Will you make the kid stop, please? Come on.</p>
<p>I think that ought to do it. Yeah.</p>
<p>That's good, Timmy. So you'll leave?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll leave.</p>
<p>Lady When you're with me I'm smiling Give me Whoaoaoa All your love So I say that went very well. Didn't you think it went well? Shut up, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. I agree with Charlie. I thought it was nice.</p>
<p>Hey, pull over. Pull over.</p>
<p>Here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. What, do you have another name on your correspondence list?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, you two, stay right here.</p>
<p>This one shouldn't take long.</p>
<p>Bro, can I talk to you for one second? Yeah.</p>
<p>What the hell's up with that?</p>
<p>It's weird. I don't know.</p>
<p>This shiteating behavior. He's been acting very weird about this list.</p>
<p>What's up with this correspondence list? Who are these people?</p>
<p>Judge Hatcher. District Attorney Andrews. Warden Phillips. What?</p>
<p>I think he's killing those people. Charlie.</p>
<p>Holy shit! He's killing... He's probably eating them too, dude.</p>
<p>And although I think eating people is very cool, not if we're involved.</p>
<p>No, Charlie, he is not killing anybody, okay? We're accomplices.</p>
<p>No, we are not. He told me these are people from his past, and he's got to take care of them.</p>
<p>And once he takes care of them, he's gonna take care of me.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Wait, that doesn't sound good. No, that doesn't sound good at all for you, bro.</p>
<p>I'm on the list, of course, and then... Uhoh. What?</p>
<p>Number 12.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Why am I on there?</p>
<p>I don't know. I don't belong on there! That's bullshit!</p>
<p>You don't put a man on a list! Rip it off!</p>
<p>You think he memorized it? Of course he memorized it. That's pointless.</p>
<p>Okay, I... What's this about? Why am I on the list?</p>
<p>Charlie...</p>
<p>It's the heroin thing.</p>
<p>Remember when he asked us to put heroin in our butts... Yes.</p>
<p>And smuggle it into prison and we didn't do it?</p>
<p>Now he's all hot and bothered 'cause we don't give him heroin? We don't put it in our butts?</p>
<p>You don't do that! You don't eat someone 'cause they don't have heroin in their ass!</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Hold on! Calm down, Charlie!</p>
<p>Red to red! Red to red!</p>
<p>Are you sure it's red to red?</p>
<p>Am I sure it's red to red?</p>
<p>You hold this one! I'm freakin' out! Red to red!</p>
<p>Red to red!</p>
<p>I can do it, right?</p>
<p>Lady Let's go!</p>
<p>Of the morning What can I do you for?</p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>What is going on in here?</p>
<p>Just laying low and breaking world records.</p>
<p>Don't even think about breathing, bitch. All right, so here's the deal.</p>
<p>Got rid of that child molester.</p>
<p>The sexual predator guy?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's gone. He's out of the situation, so my problems are solved.</p>
<p>You had a thing too, right? Mac's dad. I want your dad out of the bar.</p>
<p>Great. Me too.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure he wants to kill me, actually.</p>
<p>Why would your dad want to kill you?</p>
<p>Not sure. But we've been driving around in your car. He's got this list of names.</p>
<p>He's been checking them off...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Walt a second.</p>
<p>You've been driving around in my car?</p>
<p>Uh, my dad made me steal it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dude.</p>
<p>That son of a bitch. He's a dangerous man, and I don't want him in the bar anymore.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Dee, that's final! Don't argue with me! Mac, call the police.</p>
<p>Goodbye. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Luther, I'll wait for you.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay, Mom. Mom, are you okay? Are you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, they're taking him away.</p>
<p>They're taking away my Luther. Mom, I was... Mom! Mom, sorry. Can you listen to me?</p>
<p>Don't ever take Frank from me again!</p>
<p>He's mine now! I got him back, so...</p>
<p>What? Officer. Officer, we know everything.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? We're the ones that called you. That's my dad you're arresting.</p>
<p>He's been killing all the people on this list. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We looked into all that already.</p>
<p>He wasn't killing those people.</p>
<p>In fact, everybody on that list spoke very highly of him.</p>
<p>Spoke highly of him?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. Apparently, he was making amends with all the people he wronged.</p>
<p>Then if he hasn't been killing anybody, why are you arresting him?</p>
<p>Because he violated his parole.</p>
<p>He's not supposed to leave the state and we caught him buying three airline tickets.</p>
<p>To where?</p>
<p>Cooperstown, New York.</p>
<p>Said he was gonna take some guy named Mac and some guy named Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You guys have a good one, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Dad.</p>
<p>Dad! Dad, you did want to take me to the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.</p>
<p>It is a surprise. It's a huge surprise, Dad.</p>
<p>And I wanted Charlie to know there were no hard feelings about that whole... you know, heroin thing.</p>
<p>Ohh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Dad.</p>
<p>I am so sorry for ratting you out and turning you in.</p>
<p>You weren't gonna kill me. Of course you weren't gonna kill me. I'm your son.</p>
<p>No, I wasn't gonna kill you.</p>
<p>But I'm going to now.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As soon as I get out, I'm gonna kill you.</p>
<p>See you, Son.</p>
<p>See you real soon.</p>
