<p>Dude, I'm not gonna read this bullshit. Just get me a Coors.</p>
<p>"What do I think my greatest strength as a server Is? ' What the hell is this, Frank?</p>
<p>Employee evaluation.</p>
<p>This bar is a business, and we're gonna start acting like one.</p>
<p>I do not want to start acting like a business because that sounds boring as shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds terrible. Plus this thing's 10 pages long. I'm not gonna fill it out.</p>
<p>Well, that's gonna affect your rank. What rank?</p>
<p>I put us all on a ranking system so you kids would care about your jobs.</p>
<p>Are we ranked now?</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>What's my rank?</p>
<p>Second, after me.</p>
<p>Wait! What's my rank?</p>
<p>You're third.</p>
<p>What? Why am I third?</p>
<p>Too volatile. Bullshit!</p>
<p>That is bullshit!</p>
<p>Okay, okay. What am I?</p>
<p>You're fifth.</p>
<p>Fifth? That's last. Why in the hell would I be last? Too much lip and very sassy.</p>
<p>Sassy?</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Like right now. You just don't know when to shut up. Hello!</p>
<p>You are late.</p>
<p>I just signed the bar up to host a dance competition... that's gonna be hosted live by the Q Crew on 102 Radio!</p>
<p>Whoa! The Q Crew! Good work!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. That would be a good idea, except it's not a dance contest.</p>
<p>It's a dance marathon.</p>
<p>What's the point?</p>
<p>It's an endurance competition. We're gonna be enduring free promotion on the radio.</p>
<p>Yeah. "Location: Paddy's Bar. Time: Saturday. Date: With Charlie Kelly. Prize: Paddy's Pub"?</p>
<p>You put the bar up as a prize?</p>
<p>No, no. I put the bar under the "Pride" section... things that you're proud of.</p>
<p>It's a "Z," Charlie! Prize!</p>
<p>Didn't you read that goddamn thing? I gave it a onceover!</p>
<p>Your illiteracy has screwed us again, Charlie! Your illiteracy is screwing us!</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense!</p>
<p>I have an important question.</p>
<p>Does this make Charlie number five and I'm number four?</p>
<p>Because in light of this new information... Dee! Shut up!</p>
<p>Stop with the sass! This is what Frank is talking about! You never know when to shut up.</p>
<p>Maybe this thing isn't legal. No, it's legal. There was a lawyer there.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do now?</p>
<p>We're gonna dance our asses off!</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>DJ Squirrely D and Fat Michael here from Q102. The Q Crew.</p>
<p>Coming to you from Paddy's Pub!</p>
<p>Kicking off our old-time dance marathon.</p>
<p>Where the owners have put up their bar as the first prize.</p>
<p>Hey, how about a quick recap of the rules for our listeners who just tuned in. Fat Michael!</p>
<p>All dancers must remain on their feet and dancing at all times.</p>
<p>If you drop to the floor, you are out.</p>
<p>People, this could take hours. It could take days.</p>
<p>It could take weeks. So stay tuned, 'cause someone's gonna win a bar!</p>
<p>But only right here on Q102.</p>
<p>The Q Crew!</p>
<p>Good job, Charlie.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>Take it easy and enjoy yourself, 'cause I'm gonna win this thing with this right here!</p>
<p>What the hell is that? Eighth grade dance competition. I won to this song.</p>
<p>It's an endurance competition, Charlie.</p>
<p>We're not gonna win the bar back with some dance you did in 1989.</p>
<p>They don't care if you can dance well. It's a marathon.</p>
<p>Whoo! What's up, assholes?</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>What the hell you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm here to win your bar.</p>
<p>Ooh! Awesome. This whole thing was a mistake.</p>
<p>So maybe you can help us win the bar back.</p>
<p>Why would I ever help you do anything?</p>
<p>All you've ever done...</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>All you've ever done is screw me over.</p>
<p>Now I'm here to win back your bar.</p>
<p>We're good though, right?</p>
<p>Go to hell.</p>
<p>Hey, do you want to partner up in this dance competition? Stop touching me, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hello, jerks. Oh!</p>
<p>Surprised to see me back?</p>
<p>Rickety Cricket. I suppose you're here to win the bar because we ruined your life.</p>
<p>Good guess. And I'm gonna win this bar with the help of my shiny new legs.</p>
<p>The latest leg brace technology courtesy of the great state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Hey. Maybe we should partner up, ruin their lives together.</p>
<p>Maybe we should.</p>
<p>Jealous?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let's go, Cricket.</p>
<p>It's Matthew.</p>
<p>Holy shit. What's going on with Rickety Cricket's new legs?</p>
<p>They look so sturdy.</p>
<p>He's, like, half machine.</p>
<p>He's got, like, a liquid hydraulic cooling system going on with that thing.</p>
<p>That's cheating, dude. He's gonna win with those things, man.</p>
<p>It's like an exoskeleton. It's exactly like an exoskeleton!</p>
<p>We'll have to resort to foul play.</p>
<p>Look, there's no point in taking any chances. Let's get dirty.</p>
<p>Maybe he'll sweat so much he'll rust those bionic legs. We should kick him in the dick!</p>
<p>What is that awful noise?</p>
<p>We got our first dance-off challenge!</p>
<p>I need Mac to collect his dignity and step to the center of this dance floor.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We've only been dancing for two minutes. Who's challenged me?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Our two dancers have one song to strut...</p>
<p>Their stuff!</p>
<p>The loser will have to wear this 25pound keg around his neck... for the rest of the competition.</p>
<p>Talk about a ball and chain. I'm going through a messy divorce.</p>
<p>He's not gonna go down easy.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>He's fueled by vengeance and reinforced with space age technology.</p>
<p>And go!</p>
<p>My legs!</p>
<p>The technology failed me! He's fallen and he can't get up!</p>
<p>I am stealing that line! It's already yours!</p>
<p>All right, folks. That's our first casualty of the night.</p>
<p>But stay tuned. There's plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p>Why don't we mix things up a little bit... By slowing things down.</p>
<p>Everybody couple up and hit the dance floor.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to get "sextra" close.</p>
<p>Osmond close on Q 102.</p>
<p>The Q Crew.</p>
<p>I do not even understand the smell coming from your body, dude.</p>
<p>Relax, dude. I forgot to put on deodorant.</p>
<p>You gonna give me shit all day? I have never seen you wear deodorant, Charlie.</p>
<p>You've never seen me wash my testicles, but that doesn't mean I don't do it every Friday.</p>
<p>And I swear to God you've got lice, man.</p>
<p>I see little bugs crawling all over your body.</p>
<p>That's glitter. I tried to make myself look a little fancy for this dance competition.</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Fancy Pants. Excuse me. I'm just trying to have a good competition here.</p>
<p>I gotta get outta here.</p>
<p>When is the partner switch?</p>
<p>Ooh, this could be a great idea to shake things up a little bit with the other contestants.</p>
<p>You know, use the partner switch to get inside people's heads.</p>
<p>Why is the person that's ranked last trying to hatch a plan? Yeah, I wonder that too.</p>
<p>I just came up with an idea though.</p>
<p>This could be a good opportunity to shake things up with the other contestants.</p>
<p>We could use this partner switch to get into people's heads.</p>
<p>Now you're talking!</p>
<p>Are you being serious?</p>
<p>Shut up. We're hatching a plan. But we're gonna need a man on the outside. Frank, that's you.</p>
<p>Why? Because I'm old?</p>
<p>That's bullshit!</p>
<p>No, dude. Because you're the best at scheming.</p>
<p>We need you on the outside running things. Take a knee.</p>
<p>Kneel down. Take a knee for the team, buddy.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go! Yeah!</p>
<p>Ooh! Another one bites the dust.</p>
<p>Q Crew!</p>
<p>We did just screw him over to kick him out of the contest, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>And by the way, Frank, when we get the bar back, you're ranked last!</p>
<p>You can't rank me last. I created the ranking system.</p>
<p>Then you shouldn't have dropped out, you old bitch.</p>
<p>You lousy bastards.</p>
<p>So who's next? Who's looking good out there?</p>
<p>That young couple over there looks pretty limber. We should take them out.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll take the girl. I'm gonna dance with the waitress for a little while.</p>
<p>That's not gonna work. Mac, take the waitress.</p>
<p>You can tire her out with your spastic movement.</p>
<p>I'll tire her out with my awesome movements. Yeah, whatever it is.</p>
<p>You should get into it more, Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, this is great, Dee. I mean, this is so restful.</p>
<p>I'm really building up my reserves for later, you know? Mmm, yeah.</p>
<p>I'm just really glad I can be of help, Charlie. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mac and the waitress are getting pretty close.</p>
<p>What's the matter?</p>
<p>Can't keep up?</p>
<p>No, I can't understand why you're dancing like that. I feel like you're gonna hit me.</p>
<p>Just... Please don't hit me.</p>
<p>Good, good. Don't be afraid to get in real close, okay? Okay.</p>
<p>How long have you been a dance instructor? Oh, a long time. Years.</p>
<p>My fiancé and I, we're not really dancers.</p>
<p>We just joined this competition because we both got laid off recently...</p>
<p>Right, right, okay. I'm gonna dip you down now, okay?</p>
<p>Just stick your knee into my groin, just like that.</p>
<p>Grind your hips and pulse your thighs. Ready? Go.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Relax. He's an instructor. He's showing me a new dance. What's it called again?</p>
<p>The Rococo Bang.</p>
<p>Oh, that's funny.</p>
<p>Isn't it? Kinda looks like he's feeling you up.</p>
<p>I don't want to get in the middle of anything here, okay?</p>
<p>I'm just trying to teach your fiancée a new dance.</p>
<p>You don't want to deprive her of that, do you?</p>
<p>I think a little dance instruction might help us last longer in the competition.</p>
<p>All right. Just make it quick. I'll make it quick.</p>
<p>All right now, Gloria, for this next part you're gonna want to grip my buttocks.</p>
<p>Okay. Like that? Right. Now we're gonna go down nice and low.</p>
<p>Now grind and shift and around and push and feel and grip and grip.</p>
<p>I see. Yeah.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I'm over it anyway.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>So let's not worry about it. Let's just talk about other things for a little bit.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're over it, because he's definitely gonna bang her.</p>
<p>He's gonna bang her?</p>
<p>You're not over it!</p>
<p>I gotta stop that. I can't let that go on.</p>
<p>You know what I think you gotta do? You gotta get Mac out of this competition.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes! I gotta get him out. You gotta get rid of him.</p>
<p>All right, how would I do that? I got an idea.</p>
<p>They burned you, too, didn't they?</p>
<p>I know how it feels.</p>
<p>The pain, the hurt.</p>
<p>How about you and me, we join forces, and we make things right?</p>
<p>Get lost, street rat! I'm not a street... I was a man of the cl...</p>
<p>Look, I want these guys, Frank. I want 'em!</p>
<p>And I will stalk the streets and live in the shadows of the night... until the streets of Philadelphia run red with their blood!</p>
<p>You got a lot of anger in you, kid. You're damn right!</p>
<p>Are you in or out?</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Whoo! Here he is. Hey, bro.</p>
<p>What a competition, huh?</p>
<p>Saw you dancing with the waitress.</p>
<p>But I'm not jealous. I'm very impressed with your dance moves.</p>
<p>Thank you, Charlie.</p>
<p>Much better dancing than people give you credit for. I've always thought that.</p>
<p>That whole elbow thing...</p>
<p>You like the elbow thing?</p>
<p>It's a very specifically choreographed...</p>
<p>I'll show it to you one day.</p>
<p>I don't want to learn it.</p>
<p>You probably couldn't pull it off anyway.</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>How do you feel about Dennis?</p>
<p>Dennis? Dennis has been driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I feel like he's a little jealous. And nervous.</p>
<p>Nervous that you're gonna be ranked number one when this whole thing goes down.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>First of all, you deserve to be ranked number one at the bar.</p>
<p>I think I do, dude. I think I deserve to be number one.</p>
<p>I've been working so hard for so many years. The cream always rises to the top.</p>
<p>And you're, like, made of cream, and your cream is all over his face, man.</p>
<p>That pisses him off. He hates that shit, dude.</p>
<p>I'm always putting my cream all over his face, and it pisses him off.</p>
<p>I think we need to take Dennis out.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>And there's only one way to do it. What's that?</p>
<p>You don't want to do this, bro. Oh, I think I do, buddy.</p>
<p>'Cause I got the moves that are gonna make me number one.</p>
<p>Why don't you just go with the best dancer?</p>
<p>Hit it.</p>
<p>If I were you I'd take precaution Before I step to meet my girl Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Well, glad that's settled. I think I'm gonna go get in that chick's pants now.</p>
<p>I thought they were engaged, dude.</p>
<p>"Engaged. " That's just a word. It doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>It means they're getting married.</p>
<p>Married, engaged. They're just words, you know?</p>
<p>My parents were married and engaged once. You saw how that worked out.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go bang that chick. Enjoy wearing that keg for the rest of the competition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's good.</p>
<p>Looking a little stiff there, partner.</p>
<p>Want me to give you a couple pointers? That's okay.</p>
<p>Come on, man. Let me show you some moves. He's just trying to help.</p>
<p>All right, fine. Yeah?</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pretend like you're Gloria, okay?</p>
<p>Now, you're not nearly as beautiful as she is, but I can use my imagination.</p>
<p>What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna teach you how to dip her. That's really important.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put my arm around your waist just like that. Don't stop. Keep moving.</p>
<p>We don't want you out of the competition, right? No!</p>
<p>Then I'm gonna bend my knees and dip you down real low.</p>
<p>My goodness! What happened? You lost your grip?</p>
<p>You dropped me on purpose, asshole! Calm down, Robert.</p>
<p>It's perfectly natural to blame the teacher at first. We're all feeling a little tired.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch! Robert, stop. Come on. It was an accident.</p>
<p>Oh, come on!</p>
<p>Let's get out of here!</p>
<p>Wait a second. Gloria, you've come this far. You don't want to stop now.</p>
<p>Wow. Butt out, man. This is none of your business. Now come on, honey!</p>
<p>We came here to win.</p>
<p>We need this!</p>
<p>Wow. He's a violent guy.</p>
<p>I know. I hate it when he gets like that. Gotta be careful with that one.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>I feel your pain, Mac.</p>
<p>We all do. What the hell's going on out here?</p>
<p>We're making brownies.</p>
<p>The drug filled kind.</p>
<p>Shut up, Cricket! What's he talking about, Frank?</p>
<p>They're filled with sedatives.</p>
<p>You want to help me distribute them? I'll make you my number two.</p>
<p>You're not even in the contest anymore, bro. I certainly am.</p>
<p>I have an inside horse.</p>
<p>You see this homeless gentleman?</p>
<p>He wins, I win.</p>
<p>Come on, Mac.</p>
<p>Join our crew.</p>
<p>Shut up, you goddamn street rat! Keep working!</p>
<p>You are on your way out.</p>
<p>So you might as well go out with a bang and have some insurance.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm in. But I don't know how much longer I can last here. This thing's killing my back.</p>
<p>I'll come up with a rig.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Shut up, street rat.</p>
<p>Wow. He's getting pretty close to that pretty girl, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You gotta make him jealous.</p>
<p>I don't want to make him jealous. I want to win your bar.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. How do you think I could make him jealous?</p>
<p>I'll tell you exactly what you need to do. See that homeless guy?</p>
<p>You gotta dance with him.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>It makes sense. You're tired. I am, but I don't see how that makes sense.</p>
<p>Okay, it's reverse psychology. No, it's not.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I'm his sister.</p>
<p>I know him really well. I know him a lot better than you.</p>
<p>The only way you're gonna be able to land Dennis... is by making him feel he's lower on your list than a disgusting, filthy homeless guy.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go grind a homeless guy. Good girl. Make it dirty.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! She's really, like, grinding away over there!</p>
<p>Eat your heart out, Dennis Reynolds!</p>
<p>Hey. Hey, pretty lady?</p>
<p>Look, can you do me a favor?</p>
<p>Can you prop your leg up and, like, grind on me all sexual like?</p>
<p>Charlie's over there blowing up my spot with that girl.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. He is blowing up your spot. I know.</p>
<p>Better make some moves to get her back.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make some moves like a ranked number two guy would.</p>
<p>You're number two.</p>
<p>What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>Oh! Why are you dancing so strangely?</p>
<p>Because of all my energy. I got tons of energy now because of this.</p>
<p>Energy bar. Have some.</p>
<p>Looks like a shit ball.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>That's an energy bar!</p>
<p>Why is it so heavy and big? Because it's filled with vitamins and shit.</p>
<p>Come on, guys. Just eat it and you'll have a burst of energy. Trust me.</p>
<p>Don't eat it, Dee! It's filled with cough medicine.</p>
<p>I love you!</p>
<p>You traitor bastard!</p>
<p>Okay, that's it, Cricket. You're out of the crew. You're my whole life.</p>
<p>I love you. I ain't going out without a fight!</p>
<p>Don't leave me in the sun.</p>
<p>I'll burn.</p>
<p>You are in cahoots with those guys?</p>
<p>I'm not in cahoots with anybody!</p>
<p>You've been cahooting with them! I have not been cahooting!</p>
<p>You're wearing Rickety Cricket's exoskeleton right now!</p>
<p>I am not!</p>
<p>Yes, you are!</p>
<p>Okay! Okay!</p>
<p>So I'm wearing it.</p>
<p>You are pathetic.</p>
<p>Oh, am I, Dee?</p>
<p>Is this pathetic?</p>
<p>What are you doing, bro? What, man?</p>
<p>A man can't enjoy a sexual lady?</p>
<p>Not when it's with my partner. I'm cutting in. Get out of here! Back off!</p>
<p>I need her, man!</p>
<p>Why do you need her?</p>
<p>I need her, all right? Just put it that way. You leave me no choice, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hey, asshole.</p>
<p>Whatever. Wanna dance?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Take a load off.</p>
<p>Let these strong, sweet, sexual arms hold you. So strong.</p>
<p>I gotcha. So strong.</p>
<p>All right, night-night.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>You made me do that.</p>
<p>You piece of shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>You piece of shit!</p>
<p>Dennis Reynolds, I trusted you!</p>
<p>Why? You are the biggest piece of shit on the planet!</p>
<p>That's it. I'm taking this one out. I'm going limp.</p>
<p>No, Charlie.</p>
<p>Don't go limp.</p>
<p>I got you, Gloria.</p>
<p>You're hurting me!</p>
<p>Charlie, don't do this. He's trying to have sex with you.</p>
<p>What? I'm not gonna have sex with you! What do you mean?</p>
<p>I'm engaged!</p>
<p>Engaged is just a word. It doesn't have any meaning.</p>
<p>No, it's a very serious word.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I was getting somewhere, wasn't I? No, you weren't.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, see you later.</p>
<p>You really are the biggest piece of shit on the planet.</p>
<p>You still talking to me? I thought you were out. dick!</p>
<p>Don't worry, ma'am, 'cause I'm about to take this sucker out!</p>
<p>You're gonna take me out?</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>How are you gonna do that?</p>
<p>This right here. DJ Fat Michael!</p>
<p>Yo! Squirrely D? Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Please play my dance for a dance challenge. That's a cando, my brother.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a lesson. The cream always rises to the top.</p>
<p>And I'm about to show you the white-hot cream of an eighth-grade boy.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Play the tape.</p>
<p>You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>Watching every motion In my foolish lovers game On this endless ocean Finally lovers know no shame It was like a ballet.</p>
<p>How did he remember that choreography? It was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It was beautiful, man.</p>
<p>What's going on, monkeys? Yeah.</p>
<p>How are those kegs treating ya?</p>
<p>Pretty good.</p>
<p>What you munching on, pal?</p>
<p>Energy ball, courtesy of my partner here.</p>
<p>You look pretty woozy there, buddy. I'm feeling woozy...</p>
<p>What is it? Wait. What is up, man? I feel like I'm tripping.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, that might be the cough medicine.</p>
<p>You got about 15 minutes until you drop like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Did you play me?</p>
<p>Oh, I played you.</p>
<p>I played you good.</p>
<p>Maybe now you two jerks might want to start treating me with a little respect.</p>
<p>Why would we show you respect? Yeah, why?</p>
<p>Because I masterminded this entire situation.</p>
<p>Not only did I get Charlie to eat a drug filled brownie...</p>
<p>I got everybody in here to do it.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, people are gonna be dropping like flies, and it's gonna be me and you two jerks.</p>
<p>Good luck with those kegs, boners.</p>
<p>bitch! There is enough cough medicine in there to kill a gorilla.</p>
<p>If you keep eating it, you're not gonna last five minutes.</p>
<p>Bro, I can handle my sedatives.</p>
<p>I cannot believe how long Charlie has lasted after eating that brownie.</p>
<p>Karate... snow machine... chop set...</p>
<p>What's with the chopping? I'm chopping all over my action.</p>
<p>And mostly power.</p>
<p>He's lost his damn mind.</p>
<p>My back's killing me.</p>
<p>Break me off a piece of that exoskeleton. It doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>You can't just break off a piece of an exoskeleton.</p>
<p>Give me some of that liquid hydraulic shit! No, man! Hey!</p>
<p>It's a sensitive science!</p>
<p>Don't use your elbows!</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>Dennis, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Ohh! Double whammy! Are you happy? Dee's gonna win.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We still got Charlie.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it. I got an inside horse... Larry. That's my inside horse.</p>
<p>Larry! Stay awake!</p>
<p>Go, Larry!</p>
<p>He's staying up! Come on, Larry!</p>
<p>You can do It! You can do It, Larry!</p>
<p>You feeling bad? That's too bad.</p>
<p>'Cause I'm just getting my second wind.</p>
<p>Cricket! Now!</p>
<p>Here I come, Dee!</p>
<p>I love you so much!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, my knee!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Larry!</p>
<p>You won the bar for us!</p>
<p>Larry wins! Whoo!</p>
<p>All right, Larry!</p>
<p>I have a shattered kneecap!</p>
<p>Dee, we can start again.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Never talk to me again, you goddamn street rat!</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, Deandra.</p>
<p>At least you're not ranked last anymore.</p>
<p>Who's last now?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>That kid really needs to learn how to read.</p>
