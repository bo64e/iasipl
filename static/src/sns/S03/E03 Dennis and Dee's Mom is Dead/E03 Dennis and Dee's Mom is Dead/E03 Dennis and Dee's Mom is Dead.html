<p>That's a greatlooking set of knives, pal.</p>
<p>Where'd you get those? This old magician was trying to unload 'em.</p>
<p>Oh, so they're like magical trick knives or...</p>
<p>Well, the knives are real.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>They're used for magical tricks. But they're real.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? They're sharp too. Oh, I'll show you.</p>
<p>Hey, Dee. Can you get up against the wall? I'm just gonna...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. You're not throwing knives at me.</p>
<p>Let's just throw them at her regardless. I'll tell you...</p>
<p>No! Yeah, you know what? Start running. 'Cause we're coming.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Don't you dare. Ten, nine, eight...</p>
<p>No. No, no, no. No.</p>
<p>No. Seven, six, five...</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Listen up, everybody!</p>
<p>In the middle of somethin'! Frank, we're in the middle of something very important!</p>
<p>I got news! Your mother is dead!</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Nice try. Very funny, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm serious this time. She had a botched neck lift.</p>
<p>She's as dead as disco.</p>
<p>Who wants champagne?</p>
<p>I am so sorry. My apologies.</p>
<p>I am so busy today. It's good to see all of you.</p>
<p>That's quite all right, sir. Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Listen. Would now be a good time to say a few words... about my wonderfully warm and caring mother? No.</p>
<p>Just, you know, get to the reading part. Let's get on with it, man.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Uh, which one of you, uh, is Frank Reynolds?</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, Frank, I have something here that I need to read to you from Barbara.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>"Frank, if your...</p>
<p>"fat monkey heart is still beating...</p>
<p>"Then congratulations.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that I hereby leave all of your money... to Bruce Mathis, the real father of my children. "</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Bruce Mathis?</p>
<p>"A handsome man...</p>
<p>"with a beautiful soul...</p>
<p>And a nicer penis. "</p>
<p>You're giving all my money to that jerkoff?</p>
<p>You know, Mr. Reynolds, I'm reading what's on the document, okay?</p>
<p>Why are you giving it to him? I'm not giving...</p>
<p>She barely knew him! Yeah, I'm not giving any money to anybody.</p>
<p>You see? I'm just reading what's on a will.</p>
<p>Where is that rat bastard? Sir, I don't know.</p>
<p>Because I want to smash his face until he's dead!</p>
<p>Killed dead! Killed dead! Frank, would you forget about Bruce?</p>
<p>I wanna kill him! Mom just gave away all of our money!</p>
<p>You know what? We should just move forward, okay?</p>
<p>"For my darling son, Dennis"...</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Presumably.</p>
<p>Uh, "I give you my house. "</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Well...</p>
<p>Yeah. Now it's startin' to make sense. Read on.</p>
<p>"On the sole condition that Frank not be allowed in. "</p>
<p>I would never let him in.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>"Deandra...</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>"You get... nothing.</p>
<p>You were a disappointment and a mistake. "</p>
<p>A mistake?</p>
<p>We're twins.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We were born at the same time.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You're not making any sense.</p>
<p>Tell that bitch it doesn't make sense!</p>
<p>Okay... I'm reading the words that someone else wrote, okay?</p>
<p>I don't know your mom.</p>
<p>Never met your mom.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm certainly not speaking to your mom now.</p>
<p>Because she's dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know she's dead!</p>
<p>We're venting because we're frustrated.</p>
<p>You tell her she's a goddamn whore!</p>
<p>Okay, I...</p>
<p>Always been a whore!</p>
<p>What about jewelry? Does it say anything about jewelry?</p>
<p>It does say something about the jewelry in here... Okay.</p>
<p>In that, um, she wants to be buried in it.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it! She's taking it into the grave!</p>
<p>I tell you what, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed in you today.</p>
<p>Very upset with you.</p>
<p>You're angry.</p>
<p>You tell her for me that I will be in touch with her somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Tell her she's a bitch!</p>
<p>These are awkward situations often.</p>
<p>And I know it can be difficult.</p>
<p>Hey. Thanks for the house, dude.</p>
<p>You know... You know, I didn't give you the house.</p>
<p>That's not how this whole situation works. Yeah, you did!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Okay.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Hey. I got a plan to get back at your mother.</p>
<p>Too late. I'm already full throttle over here.</p>
<p>I'm gonna dig up her body in the middle of the night and snatch back that jewelry.</p>
<p>That's insane! Frank, that woman is buried down there like Mr. T.</p>
<p>I gotta get to that body while the earth's still loose.</p>
<p>Deandra, I know how to get the money back from Bruce.</p>
<p>What's your plan?</p>
<p>All right...</p>
<p>You call Brucie on the phone... and tell him that you want to introduce him to your new fiancé.</p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>Oh, man. This house sure brings back a lot of memories.</p>
<p>Guys! Look what I just found in Dee's old room!</p>
<p>It's her middle school diary, dude. Ooh, yeah!</p>
<p>Who gives a shit?</p>
<p>This is her diary, man.</p>
<p>It's got all her secrets and shit in here! D-Dude!</p>
<p>It says "keep out.</p>
<p>There's a little lock that we can...</p>
<p>Well, we'll get it open later. We are not reading...</p>
<p>Dee's middle school diary to you, bro!</p>
<p>Look, we need to start the healing process.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I'm devastated over here. We need to throw a big-ass party.</p>
<p>Because I need to be amongst my friends. Let's call the crew.</p>
<p>Let's round the boys up! Round the crew up!</p>
<p>And let's have a kickass party! We got the diary!</p>
<p>And the crew!</p>
<p>The boys are back in town The boys are back in town The boys are back in town!</p>
<p>I have two numbers in my phone.</p>
<p>Charlie and Dennis.</p>
<p>Huh. Well, what about all our friends, dude?</p>
<p>Yeah, what about, uh... Dooley! Call Dooley. Dooley! Let's call Dooley!</p>
<p>Dooley loves a good party!</p>
<p>Dooley!</p>
<p>Dooley in the house!</p>
<p>Dooley's in the house!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dooley killed himself.</p>
<p>Uh... oh...</p>
<p>Yeah. About two years back now.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's a real sad, sad, sad thing for him and his family.</p>
<p>That's... That's terrible.</p>
<p>I knew he was, uh...</p>
<p>Depressed. Very sad. Very depressed.</p>
<p>And, uh... How about, uh... Let's call Stash!</p>
<p>Let's get the Stash man!</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Stash? Stash man? What did you do? I set him on fire.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch. All right, forget him.</p>
<p>Forget Stash. I don't like him anyway.</p>
<p>Let's get Z-man.</p>
<p>I banged his sister.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Sully!</p>
<p>No, but...</p>
<p>Sully! I got Sully.</p>
<p>He's got a restraining order against me.</p>
<p>I can't go within 500 feet of him. Plus, you know what?</p>
<p>I banged his sister too.</p>
<p>Did you really?</p>
<p>She was gross.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I remember that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. What are we saying? We got no friends?</p>
<p>Looks like it, right?</p>
<p>Wow, that hits home.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>That's terrible. Guys, guys.</p>
<p>That's sad.</p>
<p>Do you realize what that means?</p>
<p>I mean, if we were to all die suddenly just like my mom did... we would have nobody left to mourn us.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. You know, we would have no one left behind us... to tell of our great adventures and our glorious triumphs.</p>
<p>Oh, dude. We gotta...</p>
<p>We gotta make friends.</p>
<p>All our triumphs. All our triumphs and our tales and...</p>
<p>We need to preserve our legacy.</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying, bro! Our legacy! Our whole legacy here!</p>
<p>So let's go out and make some friends, right? Okay, let's do that. But first...</p>
<p>Who wants to burn through a quick chapter of this diary?</p>
<p>How's the ponytail look? It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why... I don't understand why you're wearing this whole getup.</p>
<p>Bruce has never even seen you. Deandra, if we're gonna pull this thing off...</p>
<p>I gotta turn into a liberal yahoo just like Bruce.</p>
<p>Now, when he gets here, I want you to hold my hand through the whole thing.</p>
<p>I won't do that.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>You've gotta stop thinking of me as your dad... and start thinking of me as your fiancé, Seamus. Gross.</p>
<p>Could we please try and think of a less creepy angle?</p>
<p>But this is a grift. I mean, that's the way it is.</p>
<p>You gotta stay in character all the time.</p>
<p>As soon as you break character, you blow the grift.</p>
<p>Hand, hand.</p>
<p>No, I don't wanna touch you. Holding hands.</p>
<p>Ah, damn it.</p>
<p>Deandra.</p>
<p>Ah, my little girl. How are you doing? Are you okay?</p>
<p>Well, no, no. I'm... I'm very broken up inside.</p>
<p>Bruce, this is Seamus, my fiancé.</p>
<p>I am also broken up.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What say we all bring it on in for a hug?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>We're doing hugs.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the funeral. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We were in Uganda doing a lot of work with the Al DS crisis there and...</p>
<p>Al DS?</p>
<p>You touch anybody?</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>Hey, man!</p>
<p>What kind of shit is that? You just hugged me!</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Seamus is joking.</p>
<p>He's got a... He's got a very dry sense of humor.</p>
<p>I'm not joking!</p>
<p>That shit is serious!</p>
<p>I gotta take a shower now!</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>That's kind of... odd.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Well, that's my guy. You know? He's a...</p>
<p>Yeah. He's got a little bit of a germ problem.</p>
<p>It's... I'll get him some books for that.</p>
<p>He's... He's grieving and and... Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p>But you seem to be holding up okay.</p>
<p>It's funny that I seem like that.</p>
<p>Because I'm not holding up okay.</p>
<p>I'm very sad.</p>
<p>I'm devastated.</p>
<p>Well, there's nothing tougher than losing a parent. Oh, it's the worst!</p>
<p>It is. And it's the... So she gave you all of our money, huh?</p>
<p>All of... All of...</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>All of our fortune. She gave it to you. Weird, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Good news is it's all gonna go to help the less fortunate.</p>
<p>Every penny. Oh, well, that is good news.</p>
<p>It's a done deal. Oh, well, that's actually why we brought you here.</p>
<p>Oh, see, Seamus and I have a plan.</p>
<p>We want to adopt a ton of kids.</p>
<p>Oh, Deandra.</p>
<p>Isn't that wonderful... that we'll need to use our fortune that my mother gave you... to shove at these kids!</p>
<p>You know what I think?</p>
<p>Huh? I think I know exactly what you and Seamus need.</p>
<p>Can you sit tight? You just sit tight. Sit tight.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is he gone?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's gone.</p>
<p>Burn these clothes.</p>
<p>Tracy, cancel all my appointments.</p>
<p>L It's time for my daughter and that idiot who raised her to learn a lesson.</p>
<p>Guys, I don't know if I'm feeling this flyer idea.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It's perfect, dude.</p>
<p>How else are three guys in their late 20s supposed to make friends?</p>
<p>There's no system in place. A flyer does all the work. It does the work for us, man.</p>
<p>All right, read back what we got so far because I don't... Okay.</p>
<p>"What up? We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys... who wanna hang out in our party mansion. "</p>
<p>It sounds a little gay.</p>
<p>Yeah. It does sound gay.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You know what? Write, um, "nothing sexual. " Good. Okay.</p>
<p>"We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys who wanna hang out in our party mansion. "</p>
<p>"Nothing sexual. "</p>
<p>Good, good. And add, "Fighters welcome. "</p>
<p>'Cause, you know, we want some tough dudes and some big dudes.</p>
<p>I don't want a bunch of tough guys in here wanting to fight me.</p>
<p>No, I didn't mean that. But it would be good to have extra protection.</p>
<p>Yeah. Extra protection and...</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, uh, put "fitness encouraged. "</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>That sounds confusing.</p>
<p>Do you think so? I'll put, "Dudes in good shape. "</p>
<p>Oh, there you go!</p>
<p>That solves it. Nice.</p>
<p>I like dudes in good shape.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Okay. But we also need a guy who's funny and fat. We need a funny fat guy.</p>
<p>We need a funny fat guy. Because every crew has a funny fat guy.</p>
<p>Well, no. I'm the funny fat guy. So don't worry about that.</p>
<p>You're not fat, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah. You're also not funny.</p>
<p>I want somebody who does observational humor.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what? That would be good. Observational humor is cool.</p>
<p>You know what, guys? I'm just gonna put "nothing sexual" again just to reiterate.</p>
<p>Underline that.</p>
<p>Please, please.</p>
<p>Okay, clarity. Smart.</p>
<p>Be very clear with that.</p>
<p>And I'm thinking that the flyer should be in the shape of a beer mug.</p>
<p>Hmm... Too complicated.</p>
<p>I don't like that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh...</p>
<p>What about a bicep?</p>
<p>Bicep. Yeah!</p>
<p>A bicep. Bicep's good.</p>
<p>A bicep would really do it. All right, let's go with a bicep.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do we got?</p>
<p>Here we go. "What up? We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys...</p>
<p>"who wanna hang out in our party mansion.</p>
<p>"Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged.</p>
<p>"If you're fat, you should be able to find humor in the little things.</p>
<p>Again, nothing sexual. "</p>
<p>Underlined. Underlined. Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>No. Let's go meet some men.</p>
<p>Lookin' good, bro.</p>
<p>Lookin' very good.</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>Oh, your pants. Nice cut.</p>
<p>You know, that vertical line on the side gives your body good length.</p>
<p>Do you work here? What...</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>I'm just looking to meet some... some new guys.</p>
<p>I saw you from across the way. And I thought, yeah.</p>
<p>This guy's got a good sense of style. He's about the same age.</p>
<p>Got a nice crop of blond hair. We could definitely use a blond in the crew.</p>
<p>Mix things up a little bit.</p>
<p>Here. Why don't you just, uh... take a look at that flyer there.</p>
<p>Is this a penis?</p>
<p>A... penis?</p>
<p>No. It's a...</p>
<p>It's a bicep.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, right. "Party mansion. "</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah. Cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll swing by.</p>
<p>You'll swing by?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah. Just come by the address. We'll be there partying.</p>
<p>Sure. Yeah, at the party mansion.</p>
<p>You're gonna be perfect, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>See ya there.</p>
<p>I should give him more for his friends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, son of a bitch!</p>
<p>penis? No. It's a... a bicep.</p>
<p>Bro.</p>
<p>I just had the most perfect blond guy slip right through my fingers.</p>
<p>I mean, I had him in the palm of my hand, and then he was gone.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I mean, this guy would've been perfect for you.</p>
<p>What's up with this beefcake? Is he coming to the party or what?</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Nah, he didn't read the flyer. No, I read the flyer.</p>
<p>He didn't understand it. I understood it... perfectly.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, we need to take a second look at this flyer. Uh, yeah, dude.</p>
<p>Guys! Check out who I just met buying a crossbow.</p>
<p>This dude is the shit. I shall use this crossbow to pierce my broken heart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, dude.</p>
<p>Dude, isn't that guy awesome or what? He's like a poet.</p>
<p>That guy's not awesome.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Dude, do you know how hard it is to find... a passionate guy like that these days... they don't make 'em anymore.</p>
<p>You should've seen how passionate he got when I showed him the dick flyer.</p>
<p>You knew?</p>
<p>You knew that it was a dick?</p>
<p>Well, yeah. I thought we changed it.</p>
<p>I thought you guys were changing it.</p>
<p>It was always... It was always meant to be a bicep. It was a bicep, bro.</p>
<p>Well, then why did you cut it like...</p>
<p>'Cause it looks totally like a dick.</p>
<p>I thought, all right, let's go with the dick thing. It's more masculine anyway.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>I mean, shit...</p>
<p>If you want it to be a bicep, it needs more veins.</p>
<p>I can't wear this.</p>
<p>I gotta go home and get another costume.</p>
<p>Come on. There's no time.</p>
<p>Just sit down and shut up.</p>
<p>And wait for Bruce to get back with the money.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I can't promise that I'm not gonna go berserk... if he tries to give me Al DS again.</p>
<p>He wasn't trying to give you Al DS. Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>You're the one who's goin' on and on about staying in character.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're right. You're right. Look, we can do this, okay?</p>
<p>We just have to go along with whatever he throws at us. We're so close to that money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna blow the cover.</p>
<p>Good. Pull your shit together, Seamus. All right.</p>
<p>Surprise!</p>
<p>These are some of my adopted children. Go ahead, guys.</p>
<p>This is your new home.</p>
<p>Ooh, Mac.</p>
<p>Here come our guests. Come on.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. How did you get these guys again?</p>
<p>Oh, they're college kids.</p>
<p>I just went down to Penn.</p>
<p>I reeled them in with a couple of white lies. Put your game face on, buddy.</p>
<p>We got a legacy to preserve.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Welcome to the party mansion, bitches!</p>
<p>Get your asses in here!</p>
<p>Look at that shit, huh? Yeah!</p>
<p>Where is everybody?</p>
<p>Where are all the chicks?</p>
<p>Guess what. It's just you and us. That's right!</p>
<p>We got the party mansion to ourselves!</p>
<p>There ain't no rules in the party mansion! That's right.</p>
<p>Check this out, bitches!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, baby!</p>
<p>Nice one!</p>
<p>Let's stop being pussies, and let's funnel some beers! Let's funnel some beers!</p>
<p>I don't really drink. Wrong answer, bitch! You're a drinker tonight!</p>
<p>That's right. You guys are gonna be telling stories... for the rest of your lives about how crazy we are! Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You're gonna tell everybody how we're like those guys from Jackass.</p>
<p>How we like to smash stuff and shove shit up our asses. That's right!</p>
<p>You are gonna get so much shit shoved up your ass tonight, four eyes!</p>
<p>Yeah! You're gonna be talking about this night for the rest of your lives!</p>
<p>"Dear Diary, the dance was a total disaster.</p>
<p>"I cried myself to sleep again last night.</p>
<p>Oh! "Mom forced me to wear the back brace.</p>
<p>And all the school chanted "aluminum monster!"'</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Oh, man!</p>
<p>"Aluminum monster. "</p>
<p>That is hilarious.</p>
<p>No! Oh, it's not hilarious!</p>
<p>I share this little girl's pain.</p>
<p>Have you ever been scorned, Charlie?</p>
<p>Uh, like all day, every day, dude.</p>
<p>Then you should think of this little girl as your soul mate of pain.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, bro.</p>
<p>Babysitting a bunch of orphans was not part of our grift.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, it's either that or digging up Mom... which, for the record, I am still very into.</p>
<p>But I'm willing to do whatever we need to do to get this money, Frank.</p>
<p>Okay? If we need to adopt a couple of orphans, fine.</p>
<p>We'll get the money, and we'll take them back. Oh...</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm sure they have some kind of a return exchange policy.</p>
<p>That sounds good.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Now this one's sad. Give...</p>
<p>Give her some money.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Frank, give her some money. I'm not giving her shit! What are you talking about?</p>
<p>May I speak to you two in the kitchen?</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You two have such a great vibe! I'm ready to write a check right now.</p>
<p>But I just want to make sure that I'm helping you... to have, like, the best relationship that you can... so that these kids have a loving, stable home.</p>
<p>And I know that this may sound a little weird.</p>
<p>But I have a lot of training in family therapy.</p>
<p>And I think for me to help you...</p>
<p>I need to observe you at your most intimate.</p>
<p>I need to observe you two making love.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>How long's your boy been passed out, bro?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes.</p>
<p>I'm just worried he's gonna wake up before we throw him down those stairs.</p>
<p>You kidding me?</p>
<p>Look at him. He's gone.</p>
<p>Man, he's out.</p>
<p>You're kidding, right?</p>
<p>You're not really gonna throw him down the stairs. Oh!</p>
<p>We should throw him off the roof! Right? Great idea, dude.</p>
<p>I'm the thrower.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Why are you guys doing this? That's what friends do to each other, bro.</p>
<p>No, it isn't!</p>
<p>Guy, his mom just died.</p>
<p>Can you have a little compassion?</p>
<p>My mom just died, all right?</p>
<p>The least you could do is let us throw your buddy off the roof!</p>
<p>"I'm totally gonna tell Eric how much I like him tonight.</p>
<p>"Even though Danielle...</p>
<p>"was like all over him today in school.</p>
<p>"Mother said, "Don't bother.</p>
<p>He wants a pretty girl instead. "'</p>
<p>I can't stop crying, Ernesto.</p>
<p>Hey, me neither, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, but don't fight it, Charlie!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>It is all part of the healing process.</p>
<p>So tell me, how do you two usually begin your lovemaking sessions?</p>
<p>That's hard to say, you know?</p>
<p>Because we start it in so many... ways.</p>
<p>Seamus, perhaps... perhaps you should start by, uh, kissing her neck lightly.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>No, because, uh, we don't kiss. We don't kiss.</p>
<p>At all. No kissing.</p>
<p>Mmmmm.</p>
<p>That's unusual, but okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just tell me w...</p>
<p>Just tell me what you are into.</p>
<p>I like to watch. So I'm gonna bounce off the bed... and observe.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>See... You see what just happened, Dee?</p>
<p>Seamus has just communicated what turns him on in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>So... Yeah.</p>
<p>Perhaps now would be a good time for you to pleasure yourself for him.</p>
<p>Hmm. Then eventually Seamus will mount you.</p>
<p>Okay. You know what?</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to stop this.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I'm gonna come clean here because we've been lying to you.</p>
<p>Deandra... Deandra, just...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Think about what you're doing.</p>
<p>No. You know what? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We've been lying.</p>
<p>And the reason is...</p>
<p>Think... we haven't had sex yet... because we're waiting until we get married.</p>
<p>We're waiting.</p>
<p>We're saving ourselves.</p>
<p>We're saving ourselves!</p>
<p>Saving ourselves.</p>
<p>It's so important to me and to him... Yeah, we couldn't do it.</p>
<p>To do that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>And I... And I... And I think that maybe that's what the tension... is that you're feeling.</p>
<p>It's all sexual.</p>
<p>Oh, it's so sexual. You know, I'm also a licensed minister.</p>
<p>So why don't we just do a wedding? Like do it tomorrow?</p>
<p>Hmm! Because I've been thinking about it.</p>
<p>And I should never give the money to an unmarried couple anyway.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Family and friends, we're gathered here... to... to share in the declaration of a lifelong commitment... between this man and this woman.</p>
<p>Deandra, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Seamus... do you take this woman to be your wedded wife?</p>
<p>You bet ya.</p>
<p>Well, then by the authority of God... and the laws of the great state of Pennsylvania...</p>
<p>I now pronounce you man and wife.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Deandra!</p>
<p>You made me so happy.</p>
<p>Yeah. And you just married your daughter, Frank.</p>
<p>You know who I am? Of course I know who you are.</p>
<p>You're the little asswipe who raised my children... and turned them into animals, into monsters who... who lie and steal and take advantage of people... and contribute absolutely nothing to society.</p>
<p>Make sure you're getting this. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I can't believe Ernesto's missing this! He's gotta see it. Go get him.</p>
<p>If you knew who he was, then why did you do the whole ceremony?</p>
<p>I was just trying to push you two to your limit.</p>
<p>But apparently you... you have none. So...</p>
<p>I... I hate to interrupt.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, Bruce? Can you... Can you just pronounce them man and wife again?</p>
<p>I wanna get that in a close-up. Again? You wanna...</p>
<p>Do the thing where you're like, "And, yes, of course I know who you are. "</p>
<p>And you were getting so angry, Bruce. Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Bruce, can you make 'em kiss this time, though? Yes. Uh, sure.</p>
<p>May I... May I see the camera for just a second from this side maybe?</p>
<p>Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Uh...</p>
<p>I'm gonna take this and give it to the lawyer, and you're gonna lose the house... because, uh, you violated the conditions of the will.</p>
<p>Frank was not to set foot in the house!</p>
<p>Bruce, come on, man. D Dad, be cool, man. Like, let that slide.</p>
<p>You are acting like a real bastard, Bruce. That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>You're the most horrible people alive.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. Oh, that's a little bit going overboard.</p>
<p>That's a lot. That's a lot to say. Come on. Don't be like that.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna lose the party mansion. Thanks a lot, Frank!</p>
<p>Whoa, guys! Guys, where you going? Whoa, whoa! Hey!</p>
<p>How did they get free? Oh, come on!</p>
<p>We were just having a little fun!</p>
<p>You guys still wanna be in our crew? I don't think so.</p>
<p>I don't think they're gonna go off and tell... about our great adventures and our glorious triumphs. It doesn't seem like it.</p>
<p>No. Well, at least we still have Ernesto. Yeah, whoops.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>He robbed your house.</p>
<p>Oh, son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, I'm sorry that the grift didn't work out, sweetie.</p>
<p>We could still go get Mom's jewelry. I'll get the shovel.</p>
