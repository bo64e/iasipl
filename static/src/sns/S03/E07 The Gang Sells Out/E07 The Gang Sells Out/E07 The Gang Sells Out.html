<p>Oh, my God, dude!</p>
<p>There is definitely a helicopter pad on the roof of this building.</p>
<p>No, there isn't, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>Every single one of these corporate buildings has a helipad on the roof.</p>
<p>Charlie is right. There's always some big boss man fat cat... that needs to be able to escape by helicopter.</p>
<p>What is he escaping from? Secret tunnels then.</p>
<p>Secrets tunnels?</p>
<p>There are no...</p>
<p>Secret tunnels, a monorail system and a helipad.</p>
<p>Guys! Can we stop arguing?</p>
<p>There are two systems.</p>
<p>I don't wanna talk to this corporate drone any longer than we have to.</p>
<p>We're split on the helicopters.</p>
<p>We'll come back to the secret tunnels.</p>
<p>That was an excellent idea. I think we'd better.</p>
<p>But we can all agree we should at least hear this guy out.</p>
<p>I guess. Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Let's hear the guy out.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll hear him out.</p>
<p>We're agreed.</p>
<p>Sir, please continue.</p>
<p>O Okay. Right. Um...</p>
<p>As I was saying, when I went down to your bar the other day... nobody appeared to be working there.</p>
<p>There were people there, but they were just customers who seemed to be serving themselves.</p>
<p>We're out and about a lot, bro. Get to the point.</p>
<p>Well, we here at Media Restaurant Group... really think that the location of your bar would be a perfect spot... for one of our Oldies Rock Cafés.</p>
<p>shit, dude, how do I explain this to you? I don't know.</p>
<p>This bar... it's who we are.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>It's all we've got.</p>
<p>It's our life. You wouldn't understand that.</p>
<p>You corporate pigs think you can just buy everything.</p>
<p>You can't buy everything.</p>
<p>We know your kind.</p>
<p>You big businesses going all over town swallowing up all the small guys.</p>
<p>Well, guess what, pal...</p>
<p>Paddy's Pub can't be bought.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, if you would just please take a look at our offer.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. We'll take a look at it, but...</p>
<p>Sold!</p>
<p>There is no way I'm selling the bar.</p>
<p>It's time for a life of leisure, buddy.</p>
<p>It's time to retire and collect that pension.</p>
<p>Think of all the money we're gonna get.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>The money from selling the bar.</p>
<p>We could retire to an island.</p>
<p>We'll all get fat and tan.</p>
<p>Dee, you're not gonna get shit.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're the shareholders.</p>
<p>You own nothing.</p>
<p>Are you serious? I have been with you guys since the very beginning.</p>
<p>I would think of Paddy's as an Enron-type situation.</p>
<p>We're gonna cut and run, and we're gonna leave you out there broke and jobless.</p>
<p>It's nothing personal. It's just business. It's a business thing.</p>
<p>It does not matter one bit, because I'm not selling the bar anyway.</p>
<p>Just take a look.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>That's the offer.</p>
<p>Let's sell this piece-of-shit bar.</p>
<p>Really? Really? Just like that?</p>
<p>See ya later, piece of shit!</p>
<p>Wait just one second. We have to milk this cow for all she's worth.</p>
<p>We need to be wooed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could go for being wooed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I'd love to be wooed. I could go for some wood.</p>
<p>Uh, no. We're saying "wooed. "</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We'll get some wood. We'll build something cool. Then we'll go get the money.</p>
<p>That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about.</p>
<p>We're talking about being wooed by this corporate guy.</p>
<p>Dennis, just...</p>
<p>It's a waste of time?</p>
<p>How are you gonna be wood?</p>
<p>Let's just...</p>
<p>Let's just go and sell this bar for everything we can get.</p>
<p>Let's do it, boys. Let's go!</p>
<p>Wait a second. What the hell am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Hi. I need to apply for a job.</p>
<p>Right. Just fill out this application... and I'll put it in the stack with the others.</p>
<p>Dee? Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Are you applying for a job here?</p>
<p>Here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What, are you crazy? Gross.</p>
<p>No, I would never work here.</p>
<p>I'm working here.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm assistant managing. I thought you worked at the coffee shop.</p>
<p>I do still, but a Starbucks moved in across the street... and they're stealing all our business.</p>
<p>Right across the street? Well, that is good to know. I love Starbucks.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That's why I'm working here. Do you think you can get me a job?</p>
<p>Here? I thought you weren't applying. No, that was a lie.</p>
<p>Oh. Um...</p>
<p>Here's my application.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, you didn't fill it out yet. I Know. You do it.</p>
<p>I don't mind. I'm gonna grab a beer while you're doing that.</p>
<p>Come get me and give me all my stuff, and I'll start. I don't...</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Did you go to high school or...</p>
<p>So, you guys ready to sell?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, pal.</p>
<p>Listen. We have terms.</p>
<p>Okay. What are your terms?</p>
<p>We'd like a plaque.</p>
<p>Of us... to be hung in the new restaurant... to pay tribute and preserve our legacy.</p>
<p>Now, it could also be a statue, okay?</p>
<p>Something real classy though.</p>
<p>Something like where those American soldiers... are raising that flag up in that one war.</p>
<p>The war where we saved Japan. Oh, correct. Hiroshima.</p>
<p>Actually, Charlie, it wasn't Hiroshima.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Hiroshima's in Japan.</p>
<p>We dropped a nuclear bomb on Japan.</p>
<p>Why the hell did we drop a nuclear bomb on Japan?</p>
<p>They make all our cars. They're our friends. Not my car. I buy American.</p>
<p>American cars are pieces of shit. Everybody knows it.</p>
<p>You're making a big mistake. Japan makes the best cars. And Germany.</p>
<p>The problem with Germany is they don't make enough hybrids.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p>Excuse me!</p>
<p>What? Put some...</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>Not even close.</p>
<p>It's the tip of the iceberg. We also wanna be the ones to blow up the bar.</p>
<p>I'm sorry? Don't worry. We've already worked out everyone's part.</p>
<p>Mac, he's gonna hold the spool.</p>
<p>Charlie's gonna do the countdown.</p>
<p>Frank and I, we're gonna push the handle down... kablowie.</p>
<p>And I want the chopper.</p>
<p>No! No! No! No!</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir. I would like a helicopter flyby.</p>
<p>I don't need to be in it. I just want your corporate chopper... to fly by my apartment window real low and fast.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, you know what, here's what I'm gonna do.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pull the deal off the table.</p>
<p>Fine. Then... we'll go with the original offer.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, something a little less than the original offer. Less money?</p>
<p>We would accept something substantially less.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go ahead and offer you nothing.</p>
<p>You promised that you would not bring up the helicopter.</p>
<p>You're not the boss of me, so quit...</p>
<p>Technically, Charlie, I am the boss of you because I own half your shares.</p>
<p>Since when? You sold me half your shares of the bar for goods and services.</p>
<p>Wait a second. You've definitely given me half your shares too.</p>
<p>Maybe I gave you guys a couple shares when my back was against the wall... and I needed a little breathing room.</p>
<p>You gave me a shitload of shares for a half a sandwich.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing? Is this a hose job where you're hosing me down?</p>
<p>You hosed yourself down. You hosed yourself up and down, Charlie.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>I don't care. Get a job.</p>
<p>Oh, get a job? Just get a job?</p>
<p>Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon... and fire off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies?</p>
<p>Now we're wasting time.</p>
<p>Will you get outta here?</p>
<p>You know what... I'm walking.</p>
<p>I can't stand you guys.</p>
<p>Whew. Now that we got rid of that dead weight, let's come up with a strategy.</p>
<p>What's your plan? I'm thinking, if this fat cat is not gonna woo us... then we gotta woo him.</p>
<p>Yeah, uhhuh I thought you guys were taking me to dinner.</p>
<p>Come on. Who doesn't like to watch a naked woman swing 'round on a pole?</p>
<p>Gay man, for one.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm gay.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You're so big and tough. You do not come across as gay.</p>
<p>You don't look like a gay guy. That's 'cause he's a bear.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>He's a bear.</p>
<p>Some gay guys are twinks, and others are bears. This gay guy's a bear.</p>
<p>By the way, we're totally cool with that. To each his own.</p>
<p>Wait. I'm a little confused here. What's a twink?</p>
<p>A twink is small and slender... like Mac.</p>
<p>No. I'm too muscular.</p>
<p>I would be a bear.</p>
<p>Don't think so.</p>
<p>Not hairy enough.</p>
<p>Smooth. I would be a bear.</p>
<p>See, I don't think you'd be a bear either.</p>
<p>I don't know what you would be.</p>
<p>You're definitely not a twink.</p>
<p>I'd be a top. That's for sure.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Can a twink be a top, or is that reserved for bears?</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a great deal of switching back and forth... but I think more often than not bears are tops.</p>
<p>Unless they happen to be power bottoms. What's a power bottom?</p>
<p>A power bottom is a bottom that is capable of receiving an enormous amount of power.</p>
<p>Actually, you got it backwards.</p>
<p>A power bottom's generating all the power by doing most of the work.</p>
<p>Does the power have to do with the size or the strength of the bottom?</p>
<p>Dennis, I've heard that speed has something to do with it.</p>
<p>Speed has everything to do with it.</p>
<p>The speed of the bottom informs the top how much pressure he's supposed to apply.</p>
<p>Speed's the name of the game. Right, buddy?</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Now that you have your silverware all set out... you're gonna need to refill all the ketchup bottles in your sections.</p>
<p>Ooh. That sounds like a whole thing.</p>
<p>Know what I'll do... if they start to get empty, I'll just grab some from other tables.</p>
<p>No, because then someone else is doing your work for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, which makes my job easier.</p>
<p>That's not how we do it here.</p>
<p>You actually have to follow the rules. We're very strict.</p>
<p>Which means you probably shouldn't be drinking beer while...</p>
<p>You probably should get used to it because I'm gonna do it anyway.</p>
<p>Dee. Perfect. There you are. Look, I need a...</p>
<p>Hello. This is a surprising turn.</p>
<p>Hello, Charlie. How you doin'? This is good.</p>
<p>You working here or... Wow. Look at you. You cracked the case.</p>
<p>Why are you here then? Kinda hit rock bottom. Need a job.</p>
<p>Dee, can you hook me up with a job here?</p>
<p>I've been here for, like, two hours. Talk to the manager.</p>
<p>Oh, you're the manager now. Good for you. Thanks.</p>
<p>Not an easy accomplishment. So, job? I don't think so, Charlie.</p>
<p>You're pretty weird, you make me feel uncomfortable, and you smell really bad.</p>
<p>You say that, but I don't... I don't see it.</p>
<p>Look, when I'm at work, I am all about work. Right, Dee?</p>
<p>Really does clean a mean toilet. I'll sparkle it.</p>
<p>Fine. Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I will give you a job.</p>
<p>You can be the assistant sanitation apprentice.</p>
<p>Oho! Nice. What does that guy do?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>That guy is gonna clean up vomit and shit and put out grease fires.</p>
<p>Sold. Dee, get me a beer.</p>
<p>You can't drink beer on the job. You can get your own beer.</p>
<p>I gotta get a beer... take the edge off... and then I'll get started doin' the fires or whatever you want me to start.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Hey. You need to talk to me?</p>
<p>Dee, yeah.</p>
<p>One of the bills that you dropped on one of your tables was actually the wrong one.</p>
<p>No. I doubledropped it. I used to do it at Paddy's all the time.</p>
<p>I use the same bill for two tables, and I pocket the cash for the other one.</p>
<p>That's stealing.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>We're sticking it to those corporate bastards, aren't we?</p>
<p>We're not doing anything.</p>
<p>Okay. That's rude.</p>
<p>If they find out that I know that you're doing this, I'm gonna lose my job.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm not asking you to do much.</p>
<p>Just turn a blind eye while I rob this place stupid.</p>
<p>No. I need this job.</p>
<p>Wow. Fine. Fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have no idea why Dennis thinks you're so cool.</p>
<p>Did you say that Dennis thinks I'm cool? What's that?</p>
<p>Did you say that Dennis thinks I'm cool?</p>
<p>He thinks you're really cool. But he's my brother, so we recap the day with each other.</p>
<p>When I tell him about this, I feel like he's gonna be...</p>
<p>You don't need to tell him that this happened. No?</p>
<p>Because if you tell him that I'm cool, then... maybe we can forget that this whole thing ever happened.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<p>Knock, knock. Sorry to interrupt. Dee, let's talk sugars for one quick second.</p>
<p>You got a sugar crisis on your tables.</p>
<p>Those little sugarholder things... they don't refill themselves.</p>
<p>We're doing all the work for you, and you're making your manager look bad.</p>
<p>Thanks, Charlie.</p>
<p>No sweat.</p>
<p>It's a team effort out there, right? You gotta pick up your slack.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're doing all the work for you. You're getting a little close.</p>
<p>I think I was just stretching out, and maybe you leaned in.</p>
<p>I don't think so, but let's not let that happen again.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to do anything inappropriate.</p>
<p>I was just trying to help out.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? Back to work, everyone. Back to work, everybody.</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>
<p>Will you please drop the act?</p>
<p>She is not into you, and you're making me look bad.</p>
<p>You're making yourself look bad.</p>
<p>Your tables are pathetic, Dee.</p>
<p>You're not gonna impress her.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>He's still got it.</p>
<p>What is going on here, Frank? Who are these guys?</p>
<p>These are the Yellow Jacket boys... my old street gang from the '50s.</p>
<p>What exactly are your old, pathetic friends doing here, Frank?</p>
<p>The corporate guy decided to buy the bookstore down the block.</p>
<p>So me and the boys thought we'd do a little loitering.</p>
<p>That's dumb. That is a dumb, stupid, dumb idea. Dumb.</p>
<p>No, Dennis, it's not that dumb of an idea.</p>
<p>If we can establish that there's a seedy element outside of that bookstore... maybe the offer comes back to us.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You guys do whatever you want.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go back to that Oldies Rock Café and get Charlie and Dee back.</p>
<p>If we're not gonna sell the bar... we at least need them here cleaning our toilets and serving us our beer.</p>
<p>Great. Frank, please tell me that you have another one of those jackets.</p>
<p>Not for you, bitch.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>We want you guys to come back because they pulled out of the sale.</p>
<p>So you screw me over to sell the bar, and then you blow it.</p>
<p>Now you want me to come back just to serve you drinks and not pay me anything.</p>
<p>Is that a yes or... What is that?</p>
<p>That's a no, dick.</p>
<p>I am very happy here.</p>
<p>I will have you know I am taking this place up the butt... with a little scheme I like to call Dee's Double Drop.</p>
<p>You're doing the double drop here too? You know about this?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We always used to take the difference out of your purse.</p>
<p>What? Are there always this many chicks here?</p>
<p>Yeah. College crowd.</p>
<p>Oh, college chicks. I like that.</p>
<p>Tell you what. Why don't you get me a job as a bartender here?</p>
<p>No. Screw you.</p>
<p>I'm not helping you.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't you help me?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>How is it not obvious? It's not obvious to me at all.</p>
<p>You are stupid. You are straight up stupid.</p>
<p>Why the hell am I talking to you about this anyway? You're just an underling.</p>
<p>Let me talk to a manager. I think that's a very good idea.</p>
<p>Why don't you take this application and go to the back office?</p>
<p>I'll send the manager right in to you.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. Back here?</p>
<p>Back there.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Hey. Sorry for keeping you waiting.</p>
<p>It's busy out there tonight.</p>
<p>So, Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Uh, I understand you're looking for a bartending position.</p>
<p>What the hell you doin'?</p>
<p>You're the manager here now?</p>
<p>Things move very quickly here at the Oldies Rock Café.</p>
<p>May I? I need to look over your forms here.</p>
<p>I think I'll just... Can I just take a quick peek at that? Thank you.</p>
<p>Let's take a little look-see here. Okay. Good.</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>This all looks good.</p>
<p>So, uh, tell me about Paddy's Pub. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I think I need to know what your duties were.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna answer any of your... Did you do anything there?</p>
<p>I am not gonna answer any of your questions. Just give me a job.</p>
<p>Really. Well, does not respond well to authority. Noted.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. Goddamn you.</p>
<p>Language is a bit of an issue here at the Oldies Rock Café.</p>
<p>Charlie! What are you doing in my office?</p>
<p>A little research.</p>
<p>Are you... Dennis.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Wow, look at you. You look... Lookin' good. Okay.</p>
<p>Are you the manager?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>First of all, let me just apologize to you for never calling you back, ever.</p>
<p>And secondly, I'm here because I'm looking for a bartending job.</p>
<p>Oh, well, maybe I should then...</p>
<p>I'll go and just get your... uniform. Get me a uniform?</p>
<p>Is that what you were gonna say?</p>
<p>We said the same thing earlier.</p>
<p>Off you go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What is her name again?</p>
<p>I hate you.</p>
<p>That was a knock, man.</p>
<p>This isn't very intimidating, Frank.</p>
<p>Don't worry. We're sending out a strong message, Mac.</p>
<p>Hey, look, kids. It's a '50s doowop group.</p>
<p>What? No, we're not a '50s doowop group.</p>
<p>Would you sing us a song? We don't sing, guy.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we do. We'll sing.</p>
<p>We'll sing for you. Right, boys?</p>
<p>You guys sing? Of course we sing. We're a gang.</p>
<p>No, no! Gangsters don't sing! What are you talking about? Ever hear of gangster rap?</p>
<p>We are not gonna intimidate anybody if we're entertaining the whole goddamn neighborhood.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Listen to this.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Bom, bom bom Those darn Yellow Jacket boys Buzz, buzz, bumble They don't pay for soda pop 'cause they really rumble Buzz, buzz, buzz Bzz, bzz, bzz!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Oohooh Yeah Bumba, babababa, oombaoom Lick 'em and stick 'em, ladies!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Wow. You know what? You are not allowed to drink on the job.</p>
<p>What are you doing? I'm a bartender. All I do is drink.</p>
<p>That's against the rules. We're not actually following the rules, are we?</p>
<p>Hey, Cocktail, can I get those drinks before my shift ends?</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I've been so busy getting so many phone numbers. Yeah, what's that all about?</p>
<p>While you've been picking up bar whores...</p>
<p>I have been doubledropping like a bastard out there.</p>
<p>You're doubledropping again?</p>
<p>I never stopped doubledropping.</p>
<p>That is unbelievable.</p>
<p>What are you on about?</p>
<p>I thought we were sticking it to the man. I am not sticking it to anyone.</p>
<p>This is my job. I have to report you two.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This tattletale business is very ugly, isn't it, Dennis?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what, Dennis.</p>
<p>I took a chance giving you a job here, and you're screwing me over.</p>
<p>Why are you being so needy? Do you realize how unattractive that is to me?</p>
<p>Don't you wanna be attractive to me? Come on.</p>
<p>All right, ladies. Who wants to do a shot off my abs?</p>
<p>What's goin' on over there? Are you all right?</p>
<p>I'm not all right. Dennis and Dee are being complete assfaces.</p>
<p>I gave them a chance to work here.</p>
<p>They're stealing from the restaurant, and I'm gonna get fired.</p>
<p>What? They're stealing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I will take care of Dennis and Dee for you, all right?</p>
<p>I will rid you of those two jerks. Really?</p>
<p>Yes. Thanks, Charlie.</p>
<p>That's really nice of you.</p>
<p>Hey, how about a hug to cheer you up?</p>
<p>Well, a quick one.</p>
<p>Oh, for real? Oh, man.</p>
<p>Okay. That's good.</p>
<p>Doesn't this feel right?</p>
<p>That felt good. No. Thank you.</p>
<p>Wow. Why are you so sweaty?</p>
<p>It's really hot in here.</p>
<p>It's not hot. It's freezing.</p>
<p>It is freezing, isn't it?</p>
<p>They're blazing that A.C.</p>
<p>All right, listen, Yellow Jackets.</p>
<p>Just let me do the talking. I'm gonna let my blade do the talkin'.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank!</p>
<p>No blades. Okay?</p>
<p>We're just sending him a message.</p>
<p>If he doesn't buy the bar, then there's gonna be trouble.</p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p>What are you people doing at my house?</p>
<p>Well, actually, sir, we are here just to talk. I'm not buying your bar.</p>
<p>Look, pal, you'd better not mess with us.</p>
<p>You see Hawky over here?</p>
<p>Uhhuh.</p>
<p>He's crazy. I'm not sure what he's capable of.</p>
<p>Is that right? You got something to say, old man?</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>Guess what. I just topped myself for most phone numbers in one day... nine.</p>
<p>Nine? Come on.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Six strawberry margaritas, please. You got it, babe.</p>
<p>You know what? Don't make 'em, 'cause you won't have your jobs much longer.</p>
