<p>That's a good shirt, Charlie. I like it. You should buy that. You like it?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, stand a little to your left, please.</p>
<p>Why? Dee, just a little bit to your left?</p>
<p>Why, Charlie?</p>
<p>So I can steal it.</p>
<p>No, you're not gonna steal it. Just buy the shirt.</p>
<p>Dee, it's fine. It doesn't even have, like, the exploding ink thing on it. We're good.</p>
<p>Oh, great news. I'm not getting arrested with you. So buy it.</p>
<p>What is the point?</p>
<p>The point is that you have, like, four articles of clothing.</p>
<p>And that's it for years and years and years now. So buy something new.</p>
<p>All right, first of all, this place is a rip-off, okay?</p>
<p>Secondly, someone should teach these people how to do a decent hem, don't you think?</p>
<p>Oh, are you unsatisfied with that hem?</p>
<p>Very unsatisfied with the hem. What do you know about hems, Charlie?</p>
<p>I've been sewing my clothes back together for, like, almost my entire life.</p>
<p>I know a thing or two about a hem, Dee, all right? Well, that's just sad.</p>
<p>Well, it's not sad. It's a very valuable skill set. So, you know...</p>
<p>Just try the shirt on and buy it. All right.</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Shut up! Dee Reynolds?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ingrid! Nelson.</p>
<p>From high school.</p>
<p>Ingrid Nelson?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You look so different. What happened to all of the fat parts?</p>
<p>I lost 'em!</p>
<p>I lost a ton of weight!</p>
<p>Wow! And look at you.</p>
<p>You look so beautiful.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>You don't have that hideously... ugly, disgusting back brace anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, God! We were such losers in high school! Mmm.</p>
<p>Do you remember what people used to call us? Uh, I don't remember.</p>
<p>The Aluminum Monster and Fatty Magoo!</p>
<p>Yeah, that was it.</p>
<p>Remember?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yes. You were the Aluminum Monster! I was Fatty Magoo!</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Hey, do you remember... how you used to say that you were gonna be famous and have your own clothing line?</p>
<p>Did I say that?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Every day.</p>
<p>Every day, it was "famous actress this" and "famous model that. "</p>
<p>And all the kids did was laugh at you. That is a good memory.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I mean, it inspired me.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, "If the Aluminum Monster can do it, then so can I."</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Dee, you're in my store!</p>
<p>This is your store?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>All this, yours?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gosh! Hey, so, did you ever do any of the...</p>
<p>Are you a model now?</p>
<p>Are you... Did you...</p>
<p>Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Not-Not-Not... Yeah. Not right now... because I'm shopping.</p>
<p>Did you go to law school? Oh, my God, I did!</p>
<p>You did? Yeah, for a little while. I loved it.</p>
<p>God, you must be so busy. I'm so busy. So busy that I have to go.</p>
<p>But it was really excellent to see you.</p>
<p>Oh, it was so good to see you too. Oh, and congratulations.</p>
<p>I would love to hang out. Hang out?</p>
<p>We're gonna hang out! We're gonna do that!</p>
<p>We're gonna do all of that!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Charlie. You're not gonna believe this. Hmm?</p>
<p>I just ran into the biggest loser from my high school. And she owns this store!</p>
<p>Really? I used to say all this stuff about... how I was gonna be big and famous to keep her down. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>But it did the opposite. It, like, inspired her or something, which is terrible.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. Calm down.</p>
<p>Here's what you do, all right?</p>
<p>Pop on a couple things, slip 'em on, we'll walk right out of here.</p>
<p>No. No, that's not good enough. I gotta beat her at her own game. Charlie?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>I got a fatty to take down.</p>
<p>Dee, how's your design coming along?</p>
<p>I can't believe you stole that shirt.</p>
<p>Come on. I steal lots of things. You don't have to get all huffy about it.</p>
<p>Let me take a look. No.</p>
<p>It's not ready for looking.</p>
<p>Let me take a look-see. I'll tell you if I like it or not. Charlie, I'm not ready.</p>
<p>What are you guys working on over there?</p>
<p>Dee's designing a dress to put her old nerd friend back in her place.</p>
<p>Oh, which nerd friend?</p>
<p>Um, the fat one.</p>
<p>Ingrid Nelson. Ingrid...</p>
<p>Oh, Fatty Magoo?</p>
<p>That's right. Oh, your old sidekick. What's she been up to?</p>
<p>Well, she owns her own, like, clothing store now, right?</p>
<p>So Dee's making a dress.</p>
<p>I'm gonna help her sew it.</p>
<p>Because according to Dee, I'm a loser too. Did you know this?</p>
<p>But, Sweet Dee, being a winner's not something that you can become.</p>
<p>It's something that you're kind of born with. Like me.</p>
<p>Like us.</p>
<p>Like me.</p>
<p>All right, let me take a look at this. No, hold on.</p>
<p>Let's just peek at it. I feel like you're gonna make fun of it.</p>
<p>It's not done yet.</p>
<p>Dee, when did... What is this? Is it a boat? Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, it's... It's a boat with a triangle in it.</p>
<p>It's not a boat. No, there's a cup and a straw.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a... It's a cocktail dress. That's a strap.</p>
<p>Is it a raincoat?</p>
<p>It's not a raincoat!</p>
<p>Oh, no. That's a plug. It's a light bulb. Well, in my head, it's very...</p>
<p>It's elegant. It... I'm having a hard time putting it out onto paper...</p>
<p>Yeah. Through your hands? Have your hands been smashed with hammers?</p>
<p>What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Smashed with hammers?</p>
<p>You're definitely not gonna be putting anybody in their place with a drawing like this.</p>
<p>Let me give it a shot.</p>
<p>Dennis, take a stab at it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna start with the breasts. Oh, naturally.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Oh, those are beautiful.</p>
<p>Bountiful. Gorgeous, right? I would say so.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>You see? Okay?</p>
<p>That is some good... Then we move on to the waist.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Delicate, precise.</p>
<p>Damn, dude, you can draw. I'm getting kind of, like, a little flustered here.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that's understandable.</p>
<p>She's a nice looking lady.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, dude. How about I take this sketch, right?</p>
<p>And then I talk to Frank about, you know, a really good sewing machine.</p>
<p>And then I whip up a prototype... Oh, of my designs?</p>
<p>What? You dick! Charlie, come on! I thought we were a team!</p>
<p>Relax. I'm still gonna help you make your raincoat with the straw on it.</p>
<p>It's not a raincoat! What is this?</p>
<p>This woman doesn't even have a rib cage.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter, Dee.</p>
<p>Because winners always win.</p>
<p>You're not a winner. You're not a winner because you used to be popular in high school.</p>
<p>But I think you peaked.</p>
<p>Peaked? Peaked, Dee?</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>I haven't even begun to peak.</p>
<p>And when I do peak, you'll know.</p>
<p>Because I'm gonna peak so hard that everybody in Philadelphia's gonna feel it.</p>
<p>I'm in my prime.</p>
<p>And I bet you... that I could sell these dresses to Fatty Magoo just based on these sketches alone.</p>
<p>And your loser friend is gonna buy 'em because she's a fatty.</p>
<p>And that's just the way of the world.</p>
<p>All I have to do is turn on my winning charm... and Fatty Magoo will be putty in my hands.</p>
<p>'Cause us winners always win.</p>
<p>He wasn't talking about you.</p>
<p>I... think he was.</p>
<p>It's too streaky.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>Everywhere. Fix it.</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying, Frank! I've never spray-painted a chair before, okay?</p>
<p>Why are you covering your mouth?</p>
<p>Because that lead paint is extremely toxic.</p>
<p>What? Is that why I'm feeling so dizzy?</p>
<p>Hey, all I'm hearing is excuses.</p>
<p>And I still have a blotchy chair.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Wait a second! What am I saying? What am I doing here?</p>
<p>You're making my chair look like it was dipped in gold. Now get back to work.</p>
<p>Nobody is stupid enough to think that your chair was dipped in gold, Frank.</p>
<p>Why am I helping you?</p>
<p>Because I'm manipulating you.</p>
<p>That's the way I get people to do things for me.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>shit, that's awesome.</p>
<p>How did you do that? Yeah.</p>
<p>If you make my chair look really nice, I will tell you.</p>
<p>Deal!</p>
<p>I got you. Oh, great.</p>
<p>Oh, good, good. Excellent.</p>
<p>I need to use your business connections to see if I can get a really cheap sewing machine.</p>
<p>Why? Dennis and I are gonna make a dress, see if we can sell it.</p>
<p>You're gonna go in the garment business? No, dude.</p>
<p>I'm not going into the garment business, okay?</p>
<p>I'm just gonna make one single dress with Dennis.</p>
<p>Who's gonna run the operation?</p>
<p>It's not an operation, dude.</p>
<p>Look, I just want your help getting a sewing machine.</p>
<p>Whoa. Wait. Has that chair been dipped in gold?</p>
<p>So we would cinch it up nice and tight through the waist... giving a nice, subtle lift to the top of the dress... and keeping those fat tummies in check.</p>
<p>Gorgeous.</p>
<p>Okay, Dennis, I'm confused.</p>
<p>Why's that? These are just pictures of women with giant breasts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in some of these sketches, the women aren't even wearing clothes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>Listen, let me level with you.</p>
<p>You're an attractive enough girl. I mean, certainly you've got some potential. All right?</p>
<p>There's no reason for you to be so nervous around me.</p>
<p>Why don't you just order a couple of my dresses... and maybe if you're lucky, I'll even make one special just for you.</p>
<p>And if you look good enough in it, hell...</p>
<p>I might even consider having sex with you.</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>
<p>Terrible.</p>
<p>All right. Let's just calm down.</p>
<p>You're having a reaction. That's understandable. It's the nerd in you talking.</p>
<p>Why don't we start over? How many of my dresses would you like to order?</p>
<p>None. Not one.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna take "no" for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner.</p>
<p>And winners, we don't listen to words like "no," or "don't," or "stop. "</p>
<p>Those words are just not in our vocabulary. I know what you need.</p>
<p>You need to see my dress on a model.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>I'm gonna come back tomorrow with a model.</p>
<p>Please don't do that.</p>
<p>Save your breath, Ingrid.</p>
<p>Those words have never worked on me. I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Look, I am so confused. Why does she have light bulbs growing out of her neck?</p>
<p>Light bulbs? What?</p>
<p>Those are shoulder pads.</p>
<p>What? Yeah. You know what?</p>
<p>I'll walk you through it.</p>
<p>No. I don't even want to... Why don't you just help me make Dennis's designs?</p>
<p>Because Dennis's designs are terrible. I enjoy them.</p>
<p>I know you do. I walked in and saw you enjoying them very much this morning in the bar.</p>
<p>This again. I told you I was scratching myself, Dee!</p>
<p>You were scratching hard and very vigorously. So...</p>
<p>No. 'Cause that's the only way I can... It must've really itched.</p>
<p>All right. All right, fine. What is this thing?</p>
<p>That is Dennis's prototype. Be careful with that. No, I know it's the prototype.</p>
<p>But I don't get how it works.</p>
<p>You're asking a million questions!</p>
<p>All right, look. I'm just gonna have to walk you through it, all right?</p>
<p>So pay attention.</p>
<p>Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p>The pretty lady gets naked, of course.</p>
<p>And I help her into the prototype.</p>
<p>My hands sort of guiding along her body, making sure that it fits properly.</p>
<p>Now the dress is starting to look fantastic, you know?</p>
<p>And she feels very excited.</p>
<p>She feels very sensual.</p>
<p>And I feel very sensual about her because she looks so good.</p>
<p>And then, you know, we chitchat a little bit. No big deal.</p>
<p>But she asks me back to her place. Where did that come from?</p>
<p>I accept, you know? And then, you know, we chitchat at her place. It's no big deal.</p>
<p>But eventually she says, you know, "Do you want to make love, Charlie?"</p>
<p>Oh, God. And I say, "Are you serious? Because yes, I do. "</p>
<p>And then just, boom, we're into it.</p>
<p>And it's hot and it's passionate.</p>
<p>Charlie? Then it's just me and you, babe, all night long.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Charlie? And I satisfy her so many times, she starts screaming my name.</p>
<p>Charlie? Charlie!</p>
<p>"Charlie," she says.</p>
<p>"Charlie," she says.</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Jesus!</p>
<p>Dee!</p>
<p>What are you... I thought you had walked back over...</p>
<p>No, I've been standing here the whole time!</p>
<p>I was in the middle... Are you gonna help me with this or not?</p>
<p>No, I'm trying to...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>'Cause you're looking pretty...</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna do it myself.</p>
<p>I gotta say, Frank, I'm really happy about this partition.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how many memories this brings back. Yeah?</p>
<p>This is exactly the way I ran my sweatshops. Is it?</p>
<p>Yes. You have to separate them from us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They need to be trained.</p>
<p>Right. Okay, yeah. I got an idea. Trained.</p>
<p>I got an idea, okay? I want to play music in there. Yes?</p>
<p>'Cause I think it'll keep them happy and motivated. And they'll work harder.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Mac, you gotta break 'em.</p>
<p>You gotta break 'em like dogs!</p>
<p>Break 'em!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Break 'em like dogs! You want to learn about manipulation?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>This is it. All right, here.</p>
<p>Your first rule of manipulation... is you gotta show them who is boss!</p>
<p>You gotta rant and rave and yell at people!</p>
<p>Then they find their place.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Everyone gather around. I have an announcement to make!</p>
<p>Dennis has an announcement! Go.</p>
<p>Now's your chance. Now's my chance.</p>
<p>Rant and rave.</p>
<p>Gather around.</p>
<p>Everybody, gather around, please! We're all standing here.</p>
<p>Is this everybody?</p>
<p>Is this everybody!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Dennis has an announcement!</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard that. I'm wondering what it is.</p>
<p>It's an announcement!</p>
<p>What's up, Dennis?</p>
<p>I have an announcement.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! What is it?</p>
<p>Quiet on the floor, please! Dennis, your announcement? Thank you.</p>
<p>I think everyone will be pleased to learn that we have just received our first order.</p>
<p>That's amazing!</p>
<p>Hooo!</p>

<p>I can't believe they placed an order before they saw the prototype.</p>
<p>Believe it, Charlie, 'cause that's what just happened.</p>
<p>What the hell did Fatty Magoo like about your sketches?</p>
<p>Shut up! How many did they order? Twenty-five.</p>
<p>Twenty-five? That's right.</p>
<p>Charlie, do you have my prototype?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, do you have any more of those sketches?</p>
<p>Maybe like one where the lady's, like, looking right at you?</p>
<p>Stop talking to me.</p>
<p>All right, everyone.</p>
<p>I want those dresses. Now I don't care how you do it. Just make it work.</p>
<p>You heard the man.</p>
<p>Make it work!</p>
<p>You heard our designer! Ladies and gentlemen, back to your stations!</p>
<p>Let's make it work! No! No, I'm not going to make it work!</p>
<p>I'm designing my own clothes! I'm supposed to be the one who's beating Fatty Magoo!</p>
<p>Mac, take care of this.</p>
<p>Okay. Dee, can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p>Look, I know what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>You want to show this girl what's what. I get that.</p>
<p>And I think if you just buckle down and join the team...</p>
<p>Mac, I'm gonna stop you right there. First of all... your breath smells like an old lady fart passing through an onion.</p>
<p>Secondly, I know you're trying to manipulate me.</p>
<p>And it's not going to work.</p>
<p>Get your hand off my shoulder... because I've got a fatty to burn.</p>
<p>She's gonna be here any minute.</p>
<p>Can we get this thing tighter? Or can we lift these up a little bit? Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Are you sure this is the right size? The dress is the right size.</p>
<p>I wish we could say the same thing about your body? My God.</p>
<p>What did you eat? The entire kitchen cupboard today? What's wrong with my body?</p>
<p>So many things. I mean, your breasts, they're tiny. Your gut is huge.</p>
<p>I wear a "D" cup! Well, you're just lying about that.</p>
<p>All right now, take this gut and suck it in. What gut?</p>
<p>Suck the gut in before I scream.</p>
<p>How did you get into my office?</p>
<p>Ah. Well, how does anyone get in anywhere, Ingrid?</p>
<p>A little hard work and persistence.</p>
<p>Did you kick in my door?</p>
<p>I intend to kick down a lot of doors today, Ingrid.</p>
<p>Now, you're gonna have to use your imagination a little bit... because my model is a little on the... side.</p>
<p>But tell me what you see. Well, I see a man committing a felony... by breaking into my office and destroying my property.</p>
<p>I also see a very confused and uncomfortable model... who seems to be stuffed into an ill-fitting garbage bag.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mum, mum.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying, yes.</p>
<p>You're saying that you love the dress but you hate this model.</p>
<p>She hates the dress, you freak! Silence your mouth!</p>
<p>She cannot properly see the dress because your disgusting body is ruining it!</p>
<p>I can't believe I let you see me naked. Well, that was part of the...</p>
<p>All right. I'm calling the police. No. No, no, Ingrid.</p>
<p>There's no need to call the police, okay? Because the only crime... that's being committed today is the crime of ugliness.</p>
<p>And sadly, you can't press charges for that. You know what?</p>
<p>I'm just gonna have to come back next time with a model with a perfect body.</p>
<p>You've been a disappointment. Shame on you.</p>
<p>No, no, no. shit.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Beyond our wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Everything working out, huh, Mac?</p>
<p>This is brilliant, Frank. It's going smooth.</p>
<p>How you doing with Charlie? Did you break him like a dog yet?</p>
<p>Almost. I've changed his diet to only dry food.</p>
<p>And he's no longer allowed on any of the furniture.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>What about Deandra?</p>
<p>Hmm, not so good. She's still causing problems.</p>
<p>Hmm. You're gonna have to take care of this right away.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn.</p>
<p>Dee!</p>
<p>Come on! Just go straight!</p>
<p>Dee, come on! I feel like it's broken or something.</p>
<p>It's not broken! You're just messing with it. I'm not messing with it.</p>
<p>You're punching in and you're...</p>
<p>Don't stomp on the pedal like that!</p>
<p>How do these people... Who are these women? And what are they...</p>
<p>They're Eastern European women! I have no idea where Frank got them. They're very good sewers.</p>
<p>You should ask them how to sew.</p>
<p>Okay? They smell like sausage.</p>
<p>They do smell like sausage.</p>
<p>It's terrible. Charlie, shh!</p>
<p>Dee, I need a word.</p>
<p>Get outta here.</p>
<p>What are you working on?</p>
<p>It's my dress. You know that.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Did we not have a conversation about this, Deandra?</p>
<p>The dress does not fit the prototype.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit. Come on, Dee. Don't rock the boat here.</p>
<p>Charlie, I can handle this. I'm on your side here, man. I'm just trying to say she...</p>
<p>Charlie, sit. Don't tell me to sit, dude.</p>
<p>You want a treat? I think I got some jerky here...</p>
<p>I do have some jerky in my pocket. Do you want some?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? You sure? You want some?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wait for it. Sit.</p>
<p>Shake. Speak.</p>
<p>I would like some jerky, please. Good boy!</p>
<p>He caught it. He catches it every time.</p>
<p>You want a piece of jerky?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be a goddamn modeling agency and this is the best you've got?</p>
<p>I mean, I ask you to send me models who are attractive.</p>
<p>You send pictures of girls that have bodies like Oompa-Loompas and hippopotamuses!</p>
<p>I can't talk to you people. I can't...</p>
<p>How hard is it to find an attractive model in the city of Philadelphia? I mean...</p>
<p>Heyoh! Guess what, buddy. We did it! We filled the order!</p>
<p>What order? The dresses, dude...</p>
<p>25. Pretty efficient, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Just, uh, put 'em by the door or something.</p>
<p>Okay. Hey, you want me to help you bring 'em to the store?</p>
<p>No! No, I don't want you to ever go to the store ever!</p>
<p>Why not? Something wrong?</p>
<p>No. Everything is... great.</p>
<p>Everything is... perfect.</p>
<p>Then why don't you want me to go to the store?</p>
<p>'Cause you're busy.</p>
<p>I'm not busy. I actually have a pretty clear docket for the next couple of...</p>
<p>No, you're so busy. Because we just got another order.</p>
<p>We did? For how many?</p>
<p>Uh, a hundred.</p>
<p>A hundred? We got an order for a hundred dresses?</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh!</p>
<p>That's fantastic! Ooh.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>We gotta kick it up a notch.</p>
<p>Dee, come here! Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p>It's only 9:00 in the morning. Oh, my God. I've been here since 5:00.</p>
<p>What? Dee, things have changed around here.</p>
<p>They're running this place like a concentration camp.</p>
<p>We shouldn't even be talking right now!</p>
<p>I think you better sit down and get to work. It's bad. The situation is bad!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! They're watching us, Dee. They're always watching us.</p>
<p>What do you think they're saying out there, Frank?</p>
<p>I don't know, but I don't like it.</p>
<p>The German war propaganda was a nice idea.</p>
<p>Wait till you hear the steam whistle.</p>
<p>Charlie, where's my dress?</p>
<p>Charlie, I left it right here! Where is it?</p>
<p>Please don't do this. Did you do something with my dress?</p>
<p>What did you do? Where is it? Just go back to work.</p>
<p>Tell me where it is, you son of a bitch! I'm not supposed to say!</p>
<p>You want to lose your hand, Charlie? I'm not supposed to say!</p>

<p>It was destroyed and the materials were distributed amongst the workers.</p>
<p>What? You guys! How could you do that to me? I worked forever on that dress!</p>

<p>Yes. What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>You bought some dresses from my brother, Dennis... that were made in a sweatshop in the basement of our bar.</p>
<p>Do not listen to a word this woman says! She is stark-raving mad!</p>
<p>She's a goddamn lunatic, okay?</p>
<p>Those dresses were made... by voluntary laborers who work for us... on their own free will to feed their starving families in their home countries!</p>
<p>In a sweatshop! In a sweatshop! Not a sweatshop.</p>
