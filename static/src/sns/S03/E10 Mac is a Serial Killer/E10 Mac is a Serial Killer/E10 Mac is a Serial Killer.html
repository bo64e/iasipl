<p>So he's in the law house, right...</p>
<p>Oh, please stop talking.</p>
<p>Just let me finish my story.</p>
<p>Describing an episode of Law and Order in full detail is not a story.</p>
<p>No, it's so good. First of all, I think I could be a really good lawyer.</p>
<p>I'm better than Sam Waterston, I'll tell you that much.</p>
<p>You want to be a lawyer? Don't you think you should know how to read or write?</p>
<p>Objection. Hearsay. That's lawyer talk.</p>
<p>That's the kind of stuff you have to do.</p>
<p>That serial killer killed another woman last night. Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. It says here he's targeting young, attractive blondes.</p>
<p>Okay, that's it. I'm not closing the bar by myself anymore.</p>
<p>Why? What are you worried about?</p>
<p>You don't fit the description.</p>
<p>I fit the description. No, no. Young, attractive...</p>
<p>I fit the description. All right.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you're too big, Dee.</p>
<p>You're like a... You're like a female Larry Bird.</p>
<p>There's too much of you.</p>
<p>There's not too much of me.</p>
<p>He would never finish the job. He'd get the job done.</p>
<p>He'd spend his whole night hacking and sawing. Then he still wouldn't be done.</p>
<p>He would open his box of tools and say, "What tools am I gonna use for this?"</p>
<p>He could use normal tools. He'd look at that pile of bones and flesh and say...</p>
<p>"How many people have I murdered tonight?" "How is this just one person?"</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Well, guess what. You're Larry Bird.</p>
<p>That's okay, 'cause Larry Bird's an excellent player. He's an awesome player.</p>
<p>What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>Hey yo!</p>
<p>Hey. This guy, he got laid last night.</p>
<p>What? No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. You didn't come home.</p>
<p>Yes, I did. You're wearing the same clothes you were wearing yesterday.</p>
<p>That's what you were wearing yesterday. These are different clothes.</p>
<p>Where'd you get those scratches on your neck? What?</p>
<p>You got scratches on your neck. No, I don't.</p>
<p>Oh, let me see.</p>
<p>No. What?</p>
<p>I gotta take a piss.</p>
<p>I don't have any...</p>
<p>You guys are... Huh?</p>
<p>Well, that was weird.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>He's been acting like that a lot lately. What's gotten into him?</p>
<p>Serial killing.</p>
<p>If I'm gonna prove that Mac is guilty, I gotta apply a little pressure.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a chain saw.</p>
<p>A chain saw?</p>
<p>You can't just torture someone 'cause you think they're guilty.</p>
<p>Oh, don't give me that liberal bullshit.</p>
<p>Mac is not the serial killer. He's not smart enough. He's a dumb person.</p>
<p>And dumb people are not capable of serial killing.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? What about the scratches on his neck? I got a hunch about this.</p>
<p>You got a hunch? Frank's got a hunch. Let's just convict him.</p>
<p>Let's carve our best friend to pieces with a chain saw based on a hunch. Jesus Christ, Frank.</p>
<p>Dee, why don't you and I use a little textbook psychology?</p>
<p>And that'll lead us to the real serial killer's doorstep.</p>
<p>Are you all gonna go against me on this?</p>
<p>Sorry, Larry Bird. Stop trying to use the Larry Bird thing.</p>
<p>I don't know. Shh.</p>
<p>What are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, I forgot about this thing that I gotta do, take care of.</p>
<p>I was thinking about it in the bathroom. And I figured I should just go deal with it now.</p>
<p>So I'm just gonna go deal with it now. I guess I'll see you guys later?</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>Oh, if I prove that he is guilty...</p>
<p>I am gonna torture the shit out of him.</p>
<p>Hey, you.</p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>I don't understand. I thought we talked about this.</p>
<p>We did. It's just that my friends are getting suspicious.</p>
<p>And I cannot have them find out that we are dating again. Why not?</p>
<p>Because of your... Oh, God. Situation down there.</p>
<p>You mean my penis? Well, you don't have to say it out loud.</p>
<p>I told you.</p>
<p>I'm getting rid of it.</p>
<p>I know. But when, dude? I feel like I've been putting a lot of time in here.</p>
<p>Soon. It takes time. Look, I know that it takes time.</p>
<p>I've been reading up on the subject.</p>
<p>But maybe we should just take it easy until then.</p>
<p>Because of the penis?</p>
<p>Oh, boy. There it is.</p>
<p>The penis.</p>
<p>Yes. Because of the pen...</p>
<p>Okay, listen.</p>
<p>Here's the deal.</p>
<p>I feel like we make out, and it's great. I mean, really great.</p>
<p>But then things start to get hot and heavy and you scratch me.</p>
<p>Which is cool. But you're really strong, and it hurts.</p>
<p>And sometimes... just sometimes... I bump up against it.</p>
<p>And I... I just can't handle that.</p>
<p>Really? Because you seem like you can handle anything.</p>
<p>I mean, with that body.</p>
<p>Well. Yeah, I mean, physically, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I can handle pretty much any situation.</p>
<p>I mean, I do... work out. So...</p>
<p>You sure do.</p>
<p>I don't know. He's been in there a long time.</p>
<p>You think he's chopping up bodies?</p>
<p>He's not chopping up anything.</p>
<p>He's not a serial killer. Hey, man. What'd I tell you about bringing that chain saw?</p>
<p>Hey, you want to take a picture with it?</p>
<p>No. We're on an invest...</p>
<p>Do you have a camera? Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Absolutely then.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. How's this look? Does this look cool?</p>
<p>Hold it closer to your face and look really crazy.</p>
<p>Like I'm killing somebody?</p>
<p>Let me start it and get my tongue... Put your tongue there.</p>
<p>There he is. There he is.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>We got ourselves a serial killer.</p>
<p>No, you don't have anything.</p>
<p>That's inconclusive, Frank.</p>
<p>Look, look. He's guilty as sin.</p>
<p>Look at him. He's sneaking around.</p>
<p>You gotta have hard evidence.</p>
<p>You don't have any hard evidence.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what you do have. You got a camera. So let's snap one off, all right?</p>
<p>Okay, like this?</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>Put your tongue closer to the blade.</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Dee. What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Get outta here. You're gonna blow my cover.</p>
<p>This seems extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
<p>Dee, that is the point of being here.</p>
<p>This is the area of the highest concentration of murders by the serial killer.</p>
<p>I know. That's why I feel like a sitting duck out there. You volunteered for this, Sis.</p>
<p>If you recall, I didn't want to use you as the bait. You do not fit the profile.</p>
<p>I fit the profile, Dennis! That's the right attitude. Now pull these out or something.</p>
<p>You need to look sexy for this guy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he's never gonna... Come on.</p>
<p>I just feel like this is a very inappropriate outfit for how cold it is out here.</p>
<p>Is it cold out here?</p>
<p>It's freezing!</p>
<p>I have a down jacket on, a wool blanket.</p>
<p>It's a very toasty situation I got back here.</p>
<p>Get back out there, tiger. You can do it. I believe in you.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac?</p>
<p>Are you in there?</p>
<p>We're clear, Charlie.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>This is an illegal search, Frank.</p>
<p>What's the decorating motif of this place... prison cell?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you need a warrant to be doing this, buddy.</p>
<p>What... Why are you wearing those gloves? Fingerprints.</p>
<p>You think I want some Jew lawyer crawling up my ass in six months?</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>Extremely racist, man.</p>
<p>The guy's innocent, all right? You're poking around... but there's no point to it 'cause you're not gonna find anything.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>And Bingo was his nameo The Human Anatomy.</p>
<p>He's got a half a chapter highlighted... on the removal of human genitalia.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, what guy hasn't done some extensive research on his own genitalia? All right?</p>
<p>Don't say "you," buddy, because I woke up... to you doing some pretty frantic research last night, pal.</p>
<p>We could go tit for tat on that one. So you better drop that subject.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is that the book doesn't mean anything. You got no evidence!</p>
<p>You got no case, Frank.</p>
<p>It stinks, that stuff. This stuff is Drakkar Noir, man.</p>
<p>Damn, girl. Who you with?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I think you got the wrong idea. I'm not with anybody.</p>
<p>Word? Well, lookee here.</p>
<p>Maybe if you get up off that crack rock, you can come and be Pepper Jack's best ho.</p>
<p>Oh, no. I'm not on any crack rock.</p>
<p>I mean, one... Okay, one time I was hooked on the crack rock.</p>
<p>But that was because I was trying to get on welfare and fail a drug test.</p>
<p>But that stuff, you gotta be careful because it'll mess you.</p>
<p>Why are you asking? Do you have some on you?</p>
<p>Hi. Uh, sir, I'm sorry. We're trying to conduct a little business here.</p>
<p>ho. Pepper Jack's trying to conduct some business here too. You with this cracker?</p>
<p>No. Well, technically, we drove here together. But I'm not with anybody.</p>
<p>You heard it.</p>
<p>Your bitch chose me.</p>
<p>See now, Pepper Jack, I feel like we're miscommunication.</p>
<p>bitch, you speak when spoken to now.</p>
<p>Oh, no. No. Sir, you know what? We're just gonna get out of here. Dee, let's go.</p>
<p>Whoa. Now you're not just gonna come here and take Pepper Jack's best ho.</p>
<p>You want this ho back, Pepper Jack needs to get paid.</p>
<p>Pepper Jack, are you serious? Do Pepper Jack look like he playing?</p>
<p>I don't think Pepper Jack's playing.</p>
<p>I feel like Pepper Jack isn't playing either. No, Pepper Jack is not playing.</p>
<p>In fact, Pepper Jack about to cut somebody. Oh, please don't cut.</p>
<p>Oh, no cutting. That's not necessary. All right, how much?</p>
<p>Well, what you got? I don't know.</p>
<p>Seven bucks and a stupid thermos.</p>
<p>Is that Fraggle Rock?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, Pepper Jack love Fraggle Rock.</p>
<p>Listen, I feel like we've been going about this the wrong way.</p>
<p>I mean, you can't just jump into the mind of a serial killer.</p>
<p>I feel like you need to walk in his shoes.</p>
<p>Right. We need to go deeper. We need to eat, breathe and sleep serial killer.</p>
<p>Go through all of the steps that this guy would in order to understand his thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, what's the first step?</p>
<p>Here's what I think. If I was gonna start mass murdering people...</p>
<p>I feel like the first thing I would do is pick a victim.</p>
<p>Right. We need a victim. We need to find somebody who we would want to kill.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>But who?</p>
<p>Here you go, Dee.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>And shithead.</p>
<p>Hope you burn your tongue.</p>
<p>Sit down. No. What the hell is wrong with you?</p>
<p>What is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong with you? I saw you last night!</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>So you admit it?</p>
<p>Yeah. Don't ever admit it, Mac! Don't ever admit it!</p>
<p>It makes my job that much harder. All right, look.</p>
<p>You gotta quit this thing, buddy. I tried, dude. I tried.</p>
<p>But it's like a drug. I just get wrapped up in the moment and boom, it just happens.</p>
<p>I don't care what your sick and twisted reasons are. I don't want to hear it.</p>
<p>Who else knows about this? Nobody. Just her.</p>
<p>Well, that's good. She won't be a problem. She ain't gonna tell anybody.</p>
<p>But I gotta tell you, buddy.</p>
<p>Frank's onto you. Frank knows?</p>
<p>Well, he's sniffing around. Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>When the time is right, he's gonna come at you, and he's gonna come at you hard!</p>
<p>Here's what you gotta do. You gotta deny.</p>
<p>Deny. Just deny it. Just deny it. Deny, deny, deny, deny.</p>
<p>You just deny it.</p>
<p>Deny it to the end.</p>
<p>If you deny something, it means it never happened. It never happened.</p>
<p>You gotta promise me something here, buddy. Uhhuh?</p>
<p>You gotta stop.</p>
<p>Well, okay. That's gonna be a little bit of an issue, man.</p>
<p>I don't know if I can promise that. Are you serious?</p>
<p>I want to stop. I just...</p>
<p>Okay. Hey, man. Hey, hey.</p>
<p>Shh, shh, shh. We're gonna get you the help. All right?</p>
<p>But in the meantime, you gotta give me the time to, like, build your case.</p>
<p>You know? To... To help your defense out.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I gotta do my thing. And then...</p>
<p>And then I do some moves.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm into it.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>What the hell does that have anything to do with what we're talking about?</p>
<p>Lawyer stuff. It's a great show. Are you gonna help me?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Are you wearing my Drakkar?</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh. Accusations.</p>
<p>Well, it's just...</p>
<p>Those are no good.</p>
<p>It's my favorite...</p>
<p>I'm telling you, Dee, this is a bad idea. No. We need killing tools.</p>
<p>But you're not using your head.</p>
<p>This is serial killing 101.</p>
<p>You don't buy anything that can be traced back to you.</p>
<p>We're not buying anything.</p>
<p>My neighbor Gary works here. He is desperately in love with me.</p>
<p>We need killing tools, he needs me to smile at him every once in a while.</p>
<p>We're gonna take whatever we want for free. There's gonna be no paper trail.</p>
<p>That works. I wonder if they have painter's overalls.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>Well, my guy's a painter.</p>
<p>I go from house to house gaining very easy access to my victims.</p>
<p>And more importantly, gaining their trust. Uhhuh.</p>
<p>Who's your guy?</p>
<p>Psycho clown.</p>
<p>Psycho clown?</p>
<p>Yeah. I like to dress like a clown when I slaughter. Now help me grab some killing tools.</p>
<p>The serial killer's probably not a psycho clown, Dee.</p>
<p>Whoa. What do you think of these gardening shears?</p>
<p>I like those gardening shears very much. But do they cut through bone?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That's a good question. Hey, Gary.</p>
<p>These shears, they do cut through bone, yes?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought so.</p>
<p>Gary, my brother and I, we're gonna take these shears.</p>
<p>But we're gonna take 'em on the hush-hush. What?</p>
<p>For free.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Get back to work.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, man. That guy's a pussy. Yeah, spineless.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Messy.</p>
<p>Too messy.</p>
<p>Very messy.</p>
<p>Do you mind if my associate and I ask you a couple questions?</p>
<p>Don't feel compelled to answer any of them, Mrs. Mac.</p>
<p>I will be recording this conversation.</p>
<p>You want a fresh cigarette?</p>
<p>Here, here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I notice you like cherry pie.</p>
<p>Cut the chitchat. My client's clearly a busy woman. Ask your questions.</p>
<p>In your opinion, ma'am, was your son an angry child?</p>
<p>Objection. Leading.</p>
<p>Did he ever exhibit any hatred toward women? Irrelevant questioning.</p>
<p>Do you think he was raised in a dysfunctional family? Move to strike.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Ask her fair questions!</p>
<p>I'll give you one question, and then we're out of here! One question.</p>
<p>You think your son's out there killing people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>That's it, lady!</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>You just buried me!</p>
<p>Chain saw serial killer.</p>
<p>You buried me. That's my whole case! I'll be in touch.</p>
<p>I can't believe you actually dressed like a clown. You're gonna draw so much attention.</p>
<p>I thought we were getting into the killer's shoes.</p>
<p>But the killer's not a psycho clown, Dee. That's only in movies... stupid ones.</p>
<p>Oh, really? John Wayne Gacy? He was a psycho clown.</p>
<p>He was an excellent one. Did good work. Come on, Dee, that's...</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, you're right. He was pretty... Okay, okay. Here she comes.</p>
<p>This is the fun part, Dee. This is the part that we've been working up to.</p>
<p>This is what all the work has been for. We're gonna follow our victim.</p>
<p>Uhhuh.</p>
<p>And then we're gonna jump her.</p>
<p>And then I'm gonna strangle her and you're gonna chop her into pieces.</p>
<p>Okay, but what are we really gonna do?</p>
<p>Huh? We're not really gonna kill her. What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. That's a bummer. Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p>Let's just follow her for a little.</p>
<p>We'll throw a good scare into her.</p>
<p>Figure out what to do later. That's just not as much fun as actually...</p>
<p>No. No. I know. It's good enough. Let's do this. Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>My eyes feel like fire.</p>
<p>Dee, if you hadn't been squeaking around like a goddamn psycho clown... she never would've noticed us. No, this is not my fault.</p>
<p>Everything we do is backfiring. We need a new plan.</p>
<p>No shit, Sis. But what's the plan? What? We need a confession.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing? I'm spying. I'm spying on everybody.</p>
<p>And I got good news. I know the killer is Mac.</p>
<p>I got hard evidence. I got a confession from his mother.</p>
<p>Holy shit, Dee. You know what?</p>
<p>I just realized something. What?</p>
<p>I know who the killer is.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dee, the real serial killer is Mac.</p>
<p>That's what I just said.</p>
<p>How did we not see it earlier? I don't know.</p>
<p>Whatever! I got a plan.</p>
<p>We gotta set a trap. We're gonna get a confession.</p>
<p>But first, we gotta lure him in on the phone.</p>
<p>Hold that thought, Frank.</p>
<p>I just came up with a plan.</p>
<p>Uhhuh. We need to set a trap and get a confession from him.</p>
<p>Ooh, but first, we gotta lure him in on the phone. Yes!</p>
<p>Are you shitting me? Now, Dee, can you do a girl's voice?</p>
<p>Well, this was fun. Right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna go. Uh, same time tomorrow?</p>
<p>Well, maybe we could go out or something.</p>
<p>You know, to a restaurant.</p>
<p>Or... Or to your bar.</p>
<p>Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah, that's not gonna work.</p>
<p>I'm getting tired of this. I feel like you're afraid that people will see us together.</p>
<p>No. I don't care if people see us together.</p>
<p>I just don't want them to think that we're dating. We are dating!</p>
<p>I don't think it's too much to ask for you to keep this quiet, considering your condition.</p>
<p>Look, it's not like I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>Well, it's over. I don't know what happened, man, but it's over.</p>
<p>What's over? Did you go back?</p>
<p>Of course I went back, Charlie.</p>
<p>Damn it, Mac. I told you not to go back.</p>
<p>You're digging me a pretty big hole here!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, because she won't talk to me anymore, dude.</p>
<p>Well, that's very interesting. She talks... When did you start hearing voices?</p>
<p>That could actually help us.</p>
<p>What's the I. D? Private.</p>
<p>Should I answer it?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Go, go, go. Uh, hello?</p>
<p>Uh, okay. Uh, could you hold on one second?</p>
<p>Some chick named Sandy. She said we met at the bar the other night.</p>
<p>Speakerphone. Can you do it on speakerphone for this? Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, Sandy.</p>
<p>Uh, what's crackin'?</p>
<p>This is Mac, right?</p>
<p>Good-looking guy, great sense of humor, really bulky?</p>
<p>Uh, more ripped.</p>
<p>Strike that.</p>
<p>Jacked.</p>
<p>Irrelevant.</p>
<p>Toned.</p>
<p>Exaggeration.</p>
<p>I work out.</p>
<p>I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>Listen. I was thinking... maybe you should come over to my place tonight.</p>
<p>There's no one here.</p>
<p>I'm all alone.</p>
<p>Could you come take care of me? I'll allow it.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. Yeah, I can take care of you.</p>
<p>Great. Then I'll see you at my place. Great.</p>
<p>I'll see you tonight.</p>
<p>I'll allow it.</p>
<p>We got him.</p>
<p>Let's get the video camera and get the hell outta here. Where are we going?</p>
<p>To catch a predator.</p>
<p>Whose apartment is this? My friend Gary's.</p>
<p>Gary the hardware store guy?</p>
<p>Yeah. He's, like, never here.</p>
<p>Why do you have his keys?</p>
<p>'Cause he asked me to water his plants when he's out of town.</p>
<p>All of his plants are dead. Well, I don't do it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go oil my chain saw.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Frank, we don't need the chain saw. Is that what's in that bag?</p>
<p>Oh, we do. Because drawing a confession out of someone... is like doing a beautiful dance... a beautiful dance with a chain saw.</p>
<p>He makes less and less sense as the days go by. I don't get it at all.</p>
<p>All right, let's set up.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Gettin' laid tonight.</p>
<p>"Come on in. I am horny. "</p>
<p>Giddyap. Hello?</p>
<p>Sandy?</p>
<p>Hey, come on in.</p>
<p>Have a seat.</p>
<p>I made you some cookies.</p>
<p>I'm just in here changing into my bikini.</p>
<p>Really? Can I come back?</p>
<p>Uhuh.</p>
<p>Oh. Got the wine coolers.</p>
<p>Yummy. Did you bring any condom?</p>
<p>Ooh, not really into the whole condom thing. So...</p>
<p>Hello, Mac. How are you?</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>Why don't you have a seat, enjoy a cookie, have some iced tea.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who are you here to see?</p>
<p>My friend Sandy.</p>
<p>Oh, Sandy. Sandy, huh?</p>
<p>Is Sandy a young, attractive, blonde girl?</p>
<p>I have no idea. Uh, Sandy. Why don't you come out here, please?</p>
<p>Oh. Why hello, Mac.</p>
<p>Not so young and attractive, is she? What?</p>
<p>Must be a big disappointment.</p>
<p>What is going on here?</p>
<p>What were you planning on doing to Sandy? What do you think, dude?</p>
<p>Well, according to this phone transcript, Mac... you were going to "take care of her"?</p>
<p>Yeah. Take care of her. The Human Anatomy. How about a little light reading?</p>
<p>What are you doing with my book?</p>
<p>You know where I got it, Mac.</p>
<p>Tie him up!</p>
<p>Come on, Frank.</p>
<p>Tie me up? Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Get the camera away from me!</p>
<p>Before you go, I should tell you I'm...</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Mac. You can't keep running from this thing. You gotta face this head on!</p>
<p>I'm gonna get you off this. Don't be afraid to show me your ugly side.</p>
<p>All right. Put that away, Frank.</p>
<p>You don't need a chain saw.</p>
<p>You're talking to an innocent man.</p>
<p>All right, Mac. I'm gonna ask you now 'cause I'm tired and hungry.</p>
<p>I want to go home. I want to wash my hands of this whole stinking mess.</p>
<p>Did you or did you not snap into an alternate and distinct personality... causing you to go on a serial killing rampage?</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>What? Yes, you did.</p>
<p>You... All right, Mac. You're crazy, right? You're a crazy person.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're two people. Let's see the other guy. Let him out.</p>
<p>Let who out?</p>
<p>The serial killer, Mac!</p>
<p>Let the serial killer out!</p>
<p>I'm not a serial killer!</p>
<p>Then why all the shady behavior?</p>
<p>I've been banging the tranny!</p>
<p>I didn't want you guys to find out. No. You're trying to...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I don't even know how that works.</p>
<p>It's complicated. There's a lot... She tapes it back.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Come on, man. Oh, my God, man.</p>
<p>I've been reading up and... Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Dude, wait. So you're not the serial killer?</p>
<p>No. I just won this case.</p>
<p>That means you're a free man.</p>
<p>You're not a serial killer. See, when I came in... And I was doing...</p>
<p>You guys don't even get it, do you? I'm gonna get a beer.</p>
<p>Dee, do you think this guy's got any beer in his fridge?</p>
<p>No. There's a bunch of severed heads in there. What?</p>
<p>There's about 15 severed heads in there, I'd say.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>There's heads in there.</p>
<p>There's a lot of heads in there. A shitload of heads.</p>
<p>We're in the killer's apartment?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Neighbor Gary?</p>
<p>Gary.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I don't know who Gary is.</p>
<p>Wait. Shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>I think I hear keys.</p>
<p>What are you people doing in my apartment?</p>
