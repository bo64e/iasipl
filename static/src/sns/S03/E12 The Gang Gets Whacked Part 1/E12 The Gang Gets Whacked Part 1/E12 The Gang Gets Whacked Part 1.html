<p>Oh, wow, dude.</p>
<p>This thing is disgusting.</p>
<p>There's so much rust. Maybe we should wipe it with a wet rag.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna do that!</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because it's a goddamn circuit breaker, Mac. We'll get electrocuted.</p>
<p>No, I'm just gonna use this screwdriver, all right?</p>
<p>It's got a rubber handle.</p>
<p>That'll keep me grounded.</p>
<p>No, I'm pretty sure you have to be standing on rubber.</p>
<p>Well, the bottoms of my shoes are rubber. Oh, no! You know what it is?</p>
<p>You can't be standing on the ground at all.</p>
<p>Maybe you should jump up into midair and do it. Hmm?</p>
<p>Yeah. If you jump into the air and grab a live wire... you... won't get electrocuted.</p>
<p>But then if you land on the ground and you're still holding that wire... you'll be blown to bits.</p>
<p>I saw it in Tango and Cash.</p>
<p>So I'm supposed to risk my life based on something... that you saw in the movie Tango and Cash?</p>
<p>Kurt Russell... I think... All right, I'm gonna jam this thing with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>All right? The rubber handle will ground me. And I'll be safe.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Give it a shot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It's all set to scrape...</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wh-What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>It exploded.</p>
<p>You're making it worse!</p>
<p>Bro, you gotta pay somebody to fix this, man.</p>
<p>No! I'm tired of spending my money... every time something goes wrong in this place.</p>
<p>Well, we can't fix it, Frank! It's too dangerous!</p>
<p>It scared the shit out of me, man. Well, get Charlie to do it.</p>
<p>He won't go near the thing. He's already been electrocuted, like, 500 times.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. I think he's starting to catch on to that.</p>
<p>Dennis, get me a harness 'cause I'll have to be swinging in the air to do this.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I told you.</p>
<p>Bro, did you get the flashlights?</p>
<p>Forget about the flashlights!</p>
<p>Check these bad boys out!</p>
<p>They fell off the back of a truck.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Nice grab. All right. But what about the flashlights?</p>
<p>Uh, I'm sorry. Someone wasn't paying attention, right?</p>
<p>Free speakers, dude! Free speakers for the bar! Free speakers!</p>
<p>Mac, let's plug these bad boys in.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>We don't have any electricity!</p>
<p>That's why we needed the flashlight. Careful!</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I didn't...</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>That's a... big bag of drug.</p>
<p>This is not good, dude. Somebody's gonna be looking for those drug.</p>
<p>Relax, dude. They're gonna be shit out of luck 'cause no one...</p>
<p>No one saw us take the speakers. Did they?</p>
<p>See us take...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There you have it. Look, let's not worry or panic.</p>
<p>This is...</p>
<p>This is a lot of drug.</p>
<p>But, like, what's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Gotta get rid of it.</p>
<p>Yeah. drug are bad news.</p>
<p>Let's get rid of it.</p>
<p>Throw it in the garbage.</p>
<p>Ooh, you can't do that 'cause a kid could find it. Right.</p>
<p>Burn it. Well, then we're dealing with a fume situation.</p>
<p>Yeah. You gotta wear masks and...</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a whole thing and...</p>
<p>It's a whole production. It's a big production. All right, then bury it!</p>
<p>Oh, well... No, see. Now we're back to the kids again.</p>
<p>Because kids run with shovels, playing in dirt. Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then one of them's gonna... Okay. Call the police.</p>
<p>What, are we gonna just solve society's drug problem?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Is that on us?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Is that on us now?</p>
<p>The community is still going down the toilet.</p>
<p>So I think what you're saying, Sweet Dee, is that... we could use the unsolvable drug problem in our society... Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>To fix the solvable light problem in our bar.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Absolutely. I hear you.</p>
<p>We're saying we're gonna do the drug... and then we're gonna try and fix all the lights. No.</p>
<p>Charlie didn't understand that. That's asinine.</p>
<p>You want to rewind? Yeah, we're gonna flip the drug.</p>
<p>Make a bunch of money. Use that money to fix the electricity. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right. Well, both ways work. I kinda like my way.</p>
<p>Great plan.</p>
<p>Your way's terrible.</p>
<p>I'm in. Let's sell these drug. You're not in.</p>
<p>Whoop. Thank you. And you're not gonna sell them.</p>
<p>We'll do it, Charlie.</p>
<p>Because we found the drug.</p>
<p>And you're bossy.</p>
<p>Very bossy.</p>
<p>I'm not bossy.</p>
<p>Scumbags!</p>
<p>Frank, come on, man. Look, we're trying to get some money... to fix the lights in our bar because you won't give it to us.</p>
<p>Back in my day, only the biggest pieces of shit dealt drug.</p>
<p>We're not gonna deal drug.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>We're gonna flip it. We'll flip it once. It's a onetime flip.</p>
<p>Yeah. We'll go to your... that shady guy Bingo that you know.</p>
<p>Oh, Bingo. We'll say, you know, "Here's a pile of drug.</p>
<p>Give us some money. " And then...</p>
<p>Uhhuh.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no. You don't go to Bingo. Bingo is my contact.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm sorry. I don't think you can call dibs... on a shady peoplesmuggler.</p>
<p>You can't do that.</p>
<p>Just do not mention my name!</p>
<p>My God. Relax, dude. No one's gonna mention your name.</p>
<p>Hey, Bingo.</p>
<p>Frank sent us.</p>
<p>Frank, huh? I'm gonna skin that son of a bitch and wear his face.</p>
<p>Anyway, what's up?</p>
<p>Well, we're trying...</p>
<p>Oh, don't look at me.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Look up. Up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is this good?</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Now speak.</p>
<p>Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Uh, well, listen, Bingo. We got a bucket of nose clams fresh from the sea.</p>
<p>Sweet, delicious nose clams that are looking for a home if you follow me.</p>
<p>Nose clams?</p>
<p>No. I don't follow you.</p>
<p>I don't know what the hell you're talking about. I don't follow either.</p>
<p>Yes, you do. It's not confusing.</p>
<p>Just everybody settle down.</p>
<p>These are the kind of nose clams that make you want to dance the night away.</p>
<p>I don't get what the hell you're talking about.</p>
<p>I don't even know what you're talking about. It's so obvious!</p>
<p>You know what? It's not obvious.</p>
<p>Now you're being too vague.</p>
<p>You're talking about dancing clams in the...</p>
<p>What's gonna make you dance?</p>
<p>These are the kind of nose clams that you crush up into a line of white powder.</p>
<p>And you snort them up through your nose. And they make you high.</p>
<p>You use a dollar bill or a straw to do it. They come from Colombia.</p>
<p>They're illegal. And they rhyme with "propane. "</p>
<p>Perfect. You found a perfect medium ground there.</p>
<p>So you want to sell me cocaine?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Why didn't you just come out and say that?</p>
<p>Instead of dancing around it. That is so tacky.</p>
<p>We talked about it in the car.</p>
<p>It's a thing you do. It's not tacky.</p>
<p>That is the kindergarten behavior of drug dealing. Do you want them or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course I do. Oh, great. Well, here you go.</p>
<p>Thank you. Eyes, boom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>

<p>I was confused by it. I'm very confused by the...</p>
<p>I was very confused by the whole thing to be... if I'm being honest.</p>
<p>Look, why don't you just return what belongs to us... or pay us the 25 G's that it's worth, and we'll be square.</p>
<p>Youse got until Friday, huh?</p>

<p>No, you didn't!</p>
<p>I was using "Dead Presidents" as a cover. You didn't get that?</p>
<p>He said to the man he wanted many, many thousands of green people...</p>
<p>From history times.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>We are so screwed.</p>
<p>How are we gonna get 25 grand by Friday? I get that.</p>
<p>Don't look at me.</p>
<p>You made this bed.</p>
<p>You're sleeping in it. This is a life lesson for you.</p>
<p>Frank, this is not the time to be throwing down life lessons, all right?</p>
<p>We are going to get whacked off by a bunch of scary Italian guys.</p>
<p>Did they say they were gonna whack us off?</p>
<p>They implied they wanted to whack us all off! Okay.</p>
<p>Nobody's gonna get whacked off today, okay? Listen.</p>
<p>We're gonna take the money. We'll go get our drug back from Bingo.</p>
<p>We'll give it to the mob. And we'll pretend none of this ever happened.</p>
<p>And this time, I'll do the talking! Okay.</p>
<p>Just keep my name out of it.</p>
<p>Frank said to tell you to sell us back our drug.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Good. Good.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>$5,000.</p>

<p>Oh, boy! Just an hour ago, you gave us 300 for 'em.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't recall that.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What can we get for 300 then?</p>
<p>Uh, you want an exotic bird?</p>
<p>If you're gonna play this game, we need to buy something from you... that we can sell back to other people at a higher price. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. OxyContin.</p>
<p>It's a very popular pill these days.</p>
<p>And I happen to have a whole shitload of it.</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>1,200.</p>
<p>Oh, boy. Wow.</p>
<p>That's gonna...</p>
<p>Bingo! Wow. Goodness gracious with this guy.</p>
<p>If it's not one thing, it's another thing. Oh, okay.</p>
<p>But think about it this way. If we split it, it's only a few hundred dollars each.</p>
<p>Great, yeah. Let me just go grab my cash from my money tree... that I have planted. I know a leprechaun who has a pot of gold.</p>
<p>He lives at the end of my street.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll go to a bank and say, "Hello.</p>
<p>Do I have an account here?" Call Donald Trump!</p>
<p>How do three men in their 30s not have $800 between them?</p>
<p>They're...</p>
<p>The economy is in shambles.</p>
<p>Have you taken a close look at the marketplace right now? The NASDAQ!</p>
<p>Dow Jones!</p>
<p>It's up then down.</p>
<p>Stop talking, goddamn it! Fine! I'll do it!</p>
<p>I'm not getting my money back, am I?</p>
<p>Give us money.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do with that?</p>
<p>You tell us. Yeah. Bingo said you knew how to sell those drug.</p>
<p>I told you not to involve me in that! Did you mention my name?</p>
<p>First thing we did. First thing we did. You gonna harp on it all day?</p>
<p>Goddamn it! The guy's gonna skin me alive.</p>
<p>He is gonna skin you alive. He mentioned something about it.</p>
<p>Will you just pay the mob off so we don't have to sell these pills?</p>
<p>Dennis, I am not using any more of my money!</p>
<p>The mob is gonna kill us, man! Look, if I cave on this...</p>
<p>I'm gonna be bailing you guys out for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So... I'm putting my foot down on this one.</p>
<p>You bitches gotta earn your own money!</p>
<p>Fine! Whatever!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Because... seeing as how I'm the boss... You're not the boss.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I am. I've come up with an excellent idea.</p>
<p>Frank, you are gonna get us into that country club that you used to belong to.</p>
<p>And we're gonna sell the pills there.</p>
<p>That'd be a good place to sell those pills. Yes. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>You can't make no $25,000 from that amount of pills.</p>
<p>How long you got?</p>
<p>Till Friday.</p>
<p>Mmmmm. You're gonna have to turn a trick or two. Go into prostitution.</p>
<p>You are disgusting!</p>
<p>How could you suggest...</p>
<p>I am absolutely not doing that!</p>
<p>I wasn't talking about you.</p>
<p>Guys at those country clubs get hotter broads than you.</p>
<p>I would think, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was saying the male escort Is really hard to come by.</p>
<p>I'm picking up what you're putting down. I'll do it. Oh...</p>
<p>Uh, Charlie, you're not quite cut from the right cloth.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay. Make it me.</p>
<p>Mac, you're too low class. All those women... are gonna think they're gonna catch somethin' from you.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>They will.</p>
<p>I was thinking about Dennis.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, Frank... will any of these women be attractive in any way? Probably not.</p>
<p>Then I'm not going to do it. Let's sell some drug.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Why are you grabbing it?</p>
<p>I'm the boss.</p>
<p>Very grabby.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay. I think we gotta look for old ladies with lots of big jewelry.</p>
<p>They got the deepest pockets. Ah, that's my girl.</p>
<p>Dennis, I think you should unbutton this button too. No...</p>
<p>Show a little chest. Frank, I know what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>And I'm not gonna be a whore.</p>
<p>So just drop it. All right?</p>
<p>Holy shit. Did you guys see that midget dressed like a lawn jockey?</p>
<p>That's a jockey, Charlie.</p>
<p>Do what, now?</p>
<p>That's a real jockey.</p>
<p>The ones that ride on the horses... Forget it!</p>
<p>Really? Wait, wait, wait, wait. They have horses here?</p>
<p>There's a racetrack next door, dude.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>What? No!</p>
<p>Where are you going, man? Where are you going?</p>
<p>All right, whatever!</p>
<p>Let's split up.</p>
<p>I call Dennis. No. I'm not gonna be a whore, Frank.</p>
<p>You're already a whore. Why not make some money at it?</p>
<p>You're just gonna try and make me bang old ladies.</p>
<p>Then you're gonna have me move on to dudes.</p>
<p>I just wanna hang out. We're wasting time. Dee! Let's split up!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Oh, that's good, huh?</p>
<p>You like that?</p>
<p>It's a real beaut, ain't she?</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>You can talk?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That is great.</p>
<p>I would've figured if anything, your voice would be like super high.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, good for you.</p>
<p>She normally doesn't take to strangers. She must like you, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Wow. You know, she seems like a real nice horse.</p>
<p>Well, actually, she kicked the last stable boy's brains in.</p>
<p>Jesus. He takes his food through a straw now.</p>
<p>I bet. Hey, you wouldn't be interested in taking his job, would ya?</p>
<p>I'd be very interested.</p>
<p>Well, you have any qualms about picking up shit?</p>
<p>Terrific. Terrific.</p>
<p>Usually, we'd use a shovel for that. But to each his own, I guess.</p>
<p>Not me. Hey, why don't you come and meet the fellas?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p>Okay. Now, there's only one thing that these rich old men understand.</p>
<p>And that is money.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So I am gonna play the role of a high-powered executive. Mmm.</p>
<p>And you are going to be my secretary, Linda.</p>
<p>Ooh! No. No. I will be your business partner.</p>
<p>Dee, these guys are old school, okay?</p>
<p>They don't like women's rights.</p>
<p>Now, don't give me any lip!</p>
<p>Okay, Linda. The first thing I need you to do is get Jameson on the phone... and tell him I don't need his $650,000 investment.</p>
<p>He can shove it right back up his ass. Ooh, I got a better idea, Bob.</p>
<p>How about you do it?</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Yeah. I think you should get Jameson on the phone for me.</p>
<p>Well, why would I do that, Linda?</p>
<p>You're my secretary and a woman.</p>
<p>What do you know about investing?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. Remind me again what we're having Jameson invest in?</p>
<p>Jameson is investing in new technologies.</p>
<p>Really? Which ones?</p>
<p>Lasers.</p>
<p>Lasers!</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That is adorable.</p>
<p>Lasers, Linda!</p>
<p>Who wants to buy some drug?</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>You workin'?</p>
<p>Excuse me? Don't play dumb with me, hermano.</p>
<p>I know a gigolo when I see one.</p>
<p>No, look, I'm not a gigolo, all right?</p>
<p>For real?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, a good-looking guy like you could do very well in my business.</p>
<p>Thanks. But I'm not really into banging old ladies.</p>
<p>Bang them?</p>
<p>No, bro.</p>
<p>You got it all wrong, man.</p>
<p>These women are classy.</p>
<p>Yeah, they just want someone to be nice to them. Flirt a little bit. That's it.</p>
<p>Really? I wouldn't have to bang these ladies? No.</p>
<p>Bro, it's all fancy dinners, exotic vacations.</p>
<p>These ladies have so much cash, man. It's the life.</p>
<p>You should really think about it.</p>
<p>You could make a killing here, bro.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Nice work.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks, man.</p>
<p>Oh, that's yours.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Yours. Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, man. You said 20.</p>
<p>Take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Hey, whatever, homes.</p>
<p>Puta pendejo.</p>
<p>Man, these guys are crazy. I can't believe they bought all my pills.</p>
<p>Ah, you know what they say.</p>
<p>Nobody parties like a jockey!</p>
<p>I was not familiar with that expression, Buster.</p>
<p>I didn't even know you guys could talk.</p>
<p>So you want that job or not?</p>
<p>I tell you what. I got a little something I gotta straighten out with the mafia.</p>
<p>You know how that goes, right?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>But when that's done... maybe. Because there's something about that horse, Buster.</p>
<p>You know, it's like we looked at each other. And then there was eye contact.</p>
<p>And I was looking at the horse.</p>
<p>The horse was looking at me.</p>
<p>And then it hit me, I think maybe...</p>
<p>I was a centaur in my past life.</p>
<p>Well, something tells me you probably were never half-man, half-horse.</p>
<p>But, hell, what do I know? All I know is you got a great attitude.</p>
<p>So come on, you old son of a gun... and-and let Buster do a line off your boner.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Uh, "garcon", why don't you hook up the young lady here... with one of your best strawberry daiquiris?</p>
<p>All righty. Thanks.</p>
<p>Hey, how's it going, man? Uh, did you sell any of your pills?</p>
<p>Uh, no. Actually, I'm kind of working a different angle here, Charlie.</p>
<p>Dude, check it out. I sold all of mine. Okay, that's...</p>
<p>Lawn jockeys are crazy people, man.</p>
<p>Did you know that? Great. But, uh...</p>
<p>You're kinda cramping my style. I'm trying to drum up business here. You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying? Dude, I think I was a centaur in my past life.</p>
<p>It totally occurred to me. What makes you think you were half-man, half-horse?</p>
<p>Charlie... Come on.</p>
<p>Out, out.</p>
<p>He's working.</p>
<p>What? I'm enjoying a roll.</p>
<p>He's working. Bro, will you please get out of here?</p>
<p>You smell like cheese.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>It's horse shit.</p>
<p>Well, whatever it is, it's terrible. Okay? So...</p>
<p>Let's call it what it is. It's horse shit.</p>
<p>I have it all over my hands. But it's not cheese. Let's go. Get up.</p>
<p>The horse was eating a lot of cheese.</p>
<p>I don't know what it is. Just you stink.</p>
<p>Come on. Get up. Get up. I don't wanna get up.</p>
<p>Frank, as a matter of fact, you really don't smell that much better.</p>
<p>If you could get out, that would be really helpful.</p>
<p>Don't talk to me that way.</p>
<p>Don't talk to me. I am your pimp.</p>
<p>You are my ho.</p>
<p>Look, dude.</p>
<p>Horses don't eat cheese.</p>
<p>Don't...</p>
<p>You are ruining this!</p>
<p>First of all.</p>
<p>Will you get out of here, for the love of all that is holy on earth!</p>
<p>You reek of cheese!</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Are you the Reynolds party?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uhhuh. Yeah.</p>
<p>We had to escort your friends off the property.</p>
<p>They're waiting for you by your car. Oh...</p>
<p>Yeah. Where?</p>
<p>Ah, the guilty parties.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, Mac made a whole series of bad decisions.</p>
<p>And then we got kicked out, and they stole our drug.</p>
<p>Was he being bossy? Yeah. He was being very bossy. And now we've got nothing.</p>
<p>All right. It's not a total loss, all right? No, no, no.</p>
<p>Charlie actually...</p>
<p>I sold all my pills.</p>
<p>Oh! Nice.</p>
<p>Oh, that's awesome.</p>
<p>What about you, Dennis?</p>
<p>Dennis is a prostitute now.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>No, I'm not prostitute, okay?</p>
<p>Yes, he is. There's no banging old ladies and dudes.</p>
<p>All right? I will be providing a very important service, however... as what I would like to be called a handsome companion.</p>
<p>To dudes?</p>
<p>To guys or...</p>
<p>No, not to dudes.</p>
<p>No, hang on.</p>
<p>Hold on. Hang on. To old, fancy, rich ladies... who want to do classy, exotic, fancy things with me.</p>
<p>Great. Dennis, you keep banging dudes.</p>
<p>Dee, let's take Charlie's money and go buy some cocaine.</p>
<p>It's got higher street value. Do you see what you're doing here with the bossiness again?</p>
<p>And the demanding? I don't appreciate it. Ordering everyone around.</p>
<p>You're out, dude!</p>
<p>Oh, he's out.</p>
<p>You're not kicking me out. I'm the boss of you!</p>
<p>You're the only one who hasn't made any forward progress today. Just hang back.</p>
<p>Wait. I'm just supposed to put my life into your hands? Look, man.</p>
<p>Leave your ego out of it. We're in some...</p>
<p>Excuse me! We're in some serious hot water here... because of you and your bossiness, all right?</p>
<p>I think you should stop acting like such a baby. Go on.</p>
<p>So you're gonna leave me here? We cannot have you around us screwing things up!</p>
<p>How am I supposed to get home?</p>
<p>You're supposed to walk like the rest of the Americans.</p>
<p>You walk, you know?</p>
<p>On their two feet!</p>
<p>Walk?</p>
<p>It's like 40 miles!</p>
<p>Oh, that's why young people...</p>
<p>You can't do this to me! You can't do this!</p>
<p>I'm smart, and I deserve respect!</p>
<p>I'm gonna get you sons of bitches!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>You want to stop It already?</p>
<p>It's all right. I put the parking brake on. Sorry about that, boys.</p>
<p>Hey, you got our money?</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>No, I do not have your money. But I think there's been a misunderstanding here.</p>
<p>And I want to set it straight.</p>
<p>Proceed.</p>
<p>Well, ever since your alleged package...</p>
<p>Came into my bar, I may or may not... have had absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>You did or you didn't?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>You did have something to do with it?</p>
<p>No. No. I did have absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. You just said you did have something to do with it.</p>
<p>That's what I heard. I heard that. I think I said...</p>
<p>I did have absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But you said...</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>The thing is when you use a double negative, it becomes something completely different.</p>
<p>But you know, we can get into that later. The point is this, guys.</p>
<p>I want to get in on what you guys got.</p>
<p>I want to dress like a track star.</p>
<p>I want to wear gold shit and slick my hair back and grow a pompadour, you know?</p>
<p>You want to join our crew, huh? More than anything.</p>
<p>Okay, first things first.</p>
<p>You gotta prove your loyalty.</p>
<p>Prove my loyalty?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want you... to go clean the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The bathrooms?</p>
<p>Yeah. The bathrooms.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>'Cause that's the first step in becoming a part of our crew!</p>
<p>Okay. Guys, I clean a mean bathroom. Let's see.</p>
<p>I learned from one of my friends, Charlie.</p>
<p>You'll get to know him too maybe.</p>
<p>I'll bring him in. I'm sure you will.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You gonna really let him be part of our crew?</p>
<p>Hey, summer squash for brains...</p>
<p>I'm gonna make him our bitch till Friday.</p>
<p>Oh, bitch boy.</p>
<p>bitch boy.</p>
<p>And after that?</p>
<p>I wanna whack him off irregardless.</p>
