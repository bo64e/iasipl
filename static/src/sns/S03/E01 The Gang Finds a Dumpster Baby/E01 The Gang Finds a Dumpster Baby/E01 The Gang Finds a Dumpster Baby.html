<p>Mac, you gotta see this movie, dude.</p>
<p>Really? I thought it was boring.</p>
<p>Boring? It's about the end of the world, Dee.</p>
<p>Inconvenient Truth is not about the end of the world.</p>
<p>It is about how if we don't stop global warming, we are going to destroy this environment.</p>
<p>I think it sounds cool. I'll check it out. It is. It's awesome.</p>
<p>Dude, come on.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>What is the big deal, Dennis?</p>
<p>What is the big deal? Are you nuts?</p>
<p>It's like you see a movie, and now you're crazy about the environment.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I would actually like to do some good in this world, make a difference.</p>
<p>You wanna do good?</p>
<p>Yes. You can't do good.</p>
<p>You're not good at that. I can do good. No.</p>
<p>I am capable of doing good. No, you just screw people over for your own benefit.</p>
<p>You guys are gonna be so angry when you look back and you see... that the world looks at Dennis Reynolds and says, "Dennis, you are a good person.</p>
<p>You are making a di"...</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>There's a baby in this Dumpster.</p>
<p>What the hell is it doing?</p>
<p>We gotta call somebody.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>The police? The mother?</p>
<p>I mean, think, Dee.</p>
<p>Somebody threw this baby in the trash.</p>
<p>We can't just put it back into the system.</p>
<p>It is a terrible system.</p>
<p>It's a horrible system.</p>
<p>We live in a throwaway culture where everyone's just lookin' for the easy way out.</p>
<p>You don't wanna carry your Big Gulp anymore? Throw it in the street.</p>
<p>Don't wanna take care of your baby? Throw it in a Dumpster.</p>
<p>I just can't take it.</p>
<p>Charlie, you're harpin' on it.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry. I'd like to know whether or not I share a bed with my father.</p>
<p>I'm tellin' you, I am not your father. Then take a stupid blood test.</p>
<p>I'm not takin' no blood test. It's so easy.</p>
<p>It's a little prick... Look, I've had enough of this. I'm not even gonna talk...</p>
<p>What the hell is that? It's a baby we found in the trash.</p>
<p>Well, put it back. It doesn't belong to you.</p>
<p>We're not gonna put it back.</p>
<p>Well, give it to the cops. Get it outta here. It's bad for business.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great, Frank. Pass the buck.</p>
<p>Just passin'... Everybody passin' the buck.</p>
<p>You know, it's time we started taking responsibility for the refuse we're creating.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude. Are you still harpin' on that stupid global heating movie you saw?</p>
<p>"Global warming," Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>Like the earth is magically getting hotter.</p>
<p>All right, stop! Clearly this is not the right environment for a child.</p>
<p>I will take care of the Dumpster baby until we figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p>Dee, you're helping me. What? No, I'm not.</p>
<p>You see what's happening here? Do you see this?</p>
<p>Family values in this country are going down the toilet, and it's because of people like you.</p>
<p>Men and women raising a child together is a proven system a thousand years old.</p>
<p>There are parental roles that need to be filled here, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise, the kid winds up roaming the streets... having unprotected sex with multiple partners... Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Sharing needles and contracting the H.I.V. Virus, and it's all your fault.</p>
<p>Are you happy, Dee? Is this what you wanted?</p>
<p>You just gave this baby full-blown Al DS.</p>
<p>What the hell are these scrubs doing, dude? They're activists, Charlie.</p>
<p>They're sifting through the trash looking for recyclable materials.</p>
<p>Recycling.</p>
<p>What a waste.</p>
<p>Frank, we are trying to make a difference.</p>
<p>You see? He has no problem not callin' me "Dad. "</p>
<p>Uh, hey, man. Where can I get one of those recycle bags?</p>
<p>Get lost, narc.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>What we're doing is completely legal, so why don't you just leave us alone?</p>
<p>Oh. No, I'm not a cop, man. I just wanna help out.</p>
<p>Sure you do. I saw you pull up in that Range Rover.</p>
<p>Is everything okay, Sage?</p>
<p>Yeah. No, everything's fine.</p>
<p>I was just explaining to your friend that I... I want to help you guys out.</p>
<p>Listen, bro.</p>
<p>I know your type: Straightedge, mainline weekend warrior comin' down here... in your cashmere sweater with your moussedup, hairsprayed coif.</p>
<p>This isn't just a hobby for us.</p>
<p>So why don't you take your phony, suburban, halfassed bullshit... someplace else?</p>
<p>I'll take that, hippie.</p>
<p>Ah Hey, Frank Frank Fr-Frank Haha!</p>
<p>Dude, do you believe this thing, man? It's a...</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie, get down...</p>
<p>Dude, it's amazing! Look at this. Bro, you can chop a camel right in the hump... and drink all its milk right off the tip of this thing, man.</p>
<p>That is a find, man! That's spectacular.</p>
<p>This is an Ali Baba sword, dude.</p>
<p>Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. Look, Dennis. Look at this.</p>
<p>I don't care about that, all right? You guys are makin' me look like an asshole.</p>
<p>I'm out here tryin' to make a difference, and you're over here... rummagin' around the trash like a couple of narcs, okay?</p>
<p>You can't just come down here with your mainline, cashmere, moussecoif hair spray... and start bein' like a suburban tool.</p>
<p>You can't...</p>
<p>Are you feeling all right? What are you saying? Did you even look at this?</p>
<p>I don't know. I think I just got punked out by a couple of hippies.</p>
<p>I gotta do somethin' about this.</p>
<p>Goddamn, this Dumpster baby's heavy.</p>
<p>No, no, it's good for your back.</p>
<p>All right. So we got the diapers and the wipes and the powder.</p>
<p>shit, this raisin' babies is easy, huh? Huh?</p>
<p>I think, first things first, the baby smells like trash, right? Throw it in the bath.</p>
<p>Already with this?</p>
<p>I didn't do it.</p>
<p>Already with this? I come home to a crying baby? I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>No, I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>It's okay. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm just gonna kick back, grab a beer and watch the Sixers, all right?</p>
<p>You're not gonna help? You wanted me to do this with you.</p>
<p>Would it kill you to go shopping once in a while? We're outta beer.</p>
<p>Oh, we are? No, we're not out of anything, Mac, 'cause you don't live here.</p>
<p>Wait... One left. Nice.</p>
<p>Great. Hey, if we're gonna raise this baby together...</p>
<p>I think it's important we at least try to make it work, so... when you're done with the bath, why don't you go out and get some beer... and, um, a pack of smokes would be good.</p>
<p>We're not gonna raise anything together. I said I would help hang on to this Dumpster baby... for a couple of days until we figure what to do with it. Really?</p>
<p>Yes. You're gonna raise your voice to me right now?</p>
<p>I'm not raising my voice. Well, I'm tryin' to have a rational conversation.</p>
<p>I feel like you're berating me for absolutely no reason. So you know what? What?</p>
<p>For the sake of the baby, we need some space.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with the guys, blow off steam.</p>
<p>What? You're just gonna dump this thing on me and leave? You gonna guilt me into staying?</p>
<p>Okay, I guess I have to stay... for the sake of Dumpster Baby. But I will tell you what.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna stand here and be berated. I'm going to bed.</p>
<p>My God, I can't...</p>
<p>Charlie... would you just please lay there and go to sleep?</p>
<p>I can't sleep, dude. It's impossible.</p>
<p>My mind's goin', like, a mile a minute.</p>
<p>Well, stop thinkin' about it. I'm not your father. Now go to sleep. No.</p>
<p>Dude, it's not that. I'm thinkin' about something completely different.</p>
<p>It's the trash, isn't it?</p>
<p>It's the sweet, sweet trash.</p>
<p>I mean, man, we found some amazing shit out there today.</p>
<p>The kind of shit I didn't think you could find in the trash, you know?</p>
<p>And, uh, I'm just goin' nuts thinkin' about what else is out there.</p>
<p>Frank, there's ordinary guys just like you and me goin' through everyone else's trash.</p>
<p>They don't appreciate it. Ah, people don't appreciate their trash, Frank.</p>
<p>Let's go get the flashlights.</p>
<p>So I scale this tree. I mean, this is a big tree too, right? I get to the top of it.</p>
<p>I find the nest. This is... This is baby bluebirds. They're starving to death.</p>
<p>So I regurgitate my lunch and I nourish the entire flock... Wow.</p>
<p>Like... Well, well, well. Check it out, babe.</p>
<p>The narc is back.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, Sage, I thought about what you said, and I think you were right, man.</p>
<p>I was halfassing it. But I'm not gonna halfass it anymore.</p>
<p>I'm gonna devote myself completely to the cause. Look, bro. Just 'cause... you come in here with your Birkenstocks and your Phish T-shirt... doesn't mean you're devoted.</p>
<p>Means you're a total poser.</p>
<p>Wow. Um...</p>
<p>Well, you know what, man? Uh, I'm just gonna go then, I guess.</p>
<p>You know, I'll take my Birkenstocks and my Phish T-shirt and my... kind bud with me.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Did you just say you had kind bud?</p>
<p>Kind bu... Yeah. I mean, you know, I just have, like... this much.</p>
<p>Hey, and look at this.</p>
<p>It's a little ray gun, like.</p>
<p>Oh, that's nice, man. Look at this thing right here, dude.</p>
<p>Put this in a plastic bag and, boom, shower radio, buddy. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. We're on a roll.</p>
<p>Here's...</p>
<p>Look at this. We wrap stuff in this. Look. We can wrap it all up.</p>
<p>All right. Electrics. Electrics!</p>
<p>Whoa! A sneaker.</p>
<p>What size?</p>
<p>Fourteen.</p>
<p>Throw it in the pile, baby.</p>
<p>Crash in the pile. Ah, Charlie, isn't this great?</p>
<p>We go right to the source!</p>
<p>Forget about the dump.</p>
<p>Yeah. Screw the dump, man. It's right in your backyard, dude. Yeah. This is it.</p>
<p>What's that? What's that? What's that? It's another coat, man.</p>
<p>Ooh, can I have it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, you already got one. Frank, use your head.</p>
<p>This is the coat that's gonna protect my other coat. Come on, man.</p>
<p>Oh, when you're right, you're right.</p>
<p>Look at that. Yeah, baby. You'll find one.</p>
<p>If you keep diggin', you're gonna find one of these.</p>
<p>Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me. Huh? Oh, hello.</p>
<p>Look who it is, huh?</p>
<p>The girl who ruined my life by fallin' in love with my best friend... and havin' sex with this guy right here.</p>
<p>How you doin'?</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>And "gross" to you. And you know what? I don't know what you're doing.</p>
<p>I don't want to know. Go and do it in somebody else's Dumpster, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. What do you got in those?</p>
<p>Coffee cups and food scraps.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll take 'em.</p>
<p>Hand 'em over.</p>
<p>I don't know why it's cranky, okay? Well, maybe he's hungry.</p>
<p>Your thoughts on nursing it? I haven't slept in three days. I don't have thoughts anymore.</p>
<p>You know, raising a child is not nearly as fun as I thought it'd be.</p>
<p>Well, what if we put it back where we found it?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that is the cutest little baby I've ever seen. What's his name?</p>
<p>Uh, his name is...</p>
<p>It's...</p>
<p>D... B.</p>
<p>D.B.</p>
<p>Oh, he could be a Gerber Baby.</p>
<p>He could be in commercials.</p>
<p>I have an idea. I'm three steps ahead of ya.</p>
<p>We need to make Dumpster Baby a star. Exactly.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I'm talkin' about. We can't put it back into a corrupt system. No.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to give it a real future here. Yes, by making it a star.</p>
<p>And who have better lives than child stars? Nobody.</p>
<p>Nobody. Rich, famous... They have it all. The happiest people on earth.</p>
<p>D.B., my main man, you got tossed into the right Dumpster.</p>
<p>Brenda, I'm not gonna waste any more of your time than I have to.</p>
<p>We've got meetings with agents all over town. Can you make D.B. A star?</p>
<p>Well, I'm sorry to say, but in today's commercial world... there's just no room for another white baby actor.</p>
<p>There's an influx already.</p>
<p>White babies don't sell. White babies just aren't selling right now.</p>
<p>Question: Who is selling, Brenda?</p>
<p>Well, the Latino market is the fastest growing demographic in the country.</p>
<p>Great. So Mexicans are selling.</p>
<p>Oh, well, D.B. Can play Mexican.</p>
<p>Yeah. D.B. Could definitely be a Mexican.</p>
<p>We get him some pistols. He fires 'em off like crazy. He does...</p>
<p>Do the jumpin' thing. He does the Mexican Jumpin' Bean. Watch this.</p>
<p>Ayayay!</p>
<p>We get him a little thing with chips. He could sell chips.</p>
<p>And he can dip the chips into the nacho cheese.</p>
<p>It's perfect. It's perfect. It's hilarious.</p>
<p>For all we know, he is Mexican.</p>
<p>'Cause here's the thing. Tell 'em the thing. Oh, we've got... Ooh, I...</p>
<p>Look. I can't really get into the specifics of the whole thing... but we've got no idea who D.B.'s dad is. We don't know who the dad is.</p>
<p>It isn't me. I'm sorry, but your son just does not look Latino.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, I mean, that's a bit of a disappointment. That makes me sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we're truly tryin' to give him a... future.</p>
<p>Is there anything that we can do?</p>
<p>Well, not unless you can change the color of this baby's skin.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. You want to put your baby into a tanning bed.</p>
<p>That's correct. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>That's against the law.</p>
<p>Look, pal, we are well aware of the law, okay? And we don't wanna jam you up here.</p>
<p>We just wanna put him in there for a couple of minutes. Just to get a base.</p>
<p>We'll sign whatever waivers. Cook him a couple of minutes, and we'll be out of your hair.</p>
<p>I am feeling compelled to call the authorities.</p>
<p>Oh, are you? Well, then why don't we take our business elsewhere?</p>
<p>I sense some judgment in your voice, sir, and I don't appreciate it.</p>
<p>You could have helped change this child's life forever. You chose not to.</p>
<p>That's on you.</p>
<p>I can live with that.</p>
<p>Come on, D.B. I guess the road to stardom... is paved with hard knocks and orange assholes.</p>
<p>Trees are people too Save this tree These developer pigs are gonna tear down this tree.</p>
<p>So tonight we will hold a candlelight vigil in protest.</p>

<p>Hey, Sage, Asriel, can we commune for a moment?</p>
<p>Yeah. What's up?</p>
<p>Well, listen. I don't want to be putting out any negative vibrations... or anything like that, but I think we're going about this the wrong way.</p>
<p>Thanks, but, uh, we got it. Okay, why don't we hear him out, Sage?</p>
<p>Thanks, Asriel. Well, listen. While I think lighting a couple of candles... and singin' a few sweet jams sounds like a really good time... it's not gonna stop a bulldozer.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to step up and be a hero here.</p>
<p>So I'm thinkin', I would chain myself to that tree... and that way, if they wanna kill that tree, they gotta kill me first.</p>
<p>That is so brave of you, Dennis.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>If anyone is gonna chain themselves to anything, it's gonna be me.</p>
<p>But it was Dennis's idea.</p>
<p>No, wait, Asriel. He's right.</p>
<p>Maybe it should be him. Right.</p>
<p>I'm the one in charge here.</p>
<p>Right. You're the one in charge.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Mountain, go get some chains.</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>
<p>Hold off on that, Mountain.</p>
<p>I brought some.</p>
<p>Charlie, we gotta stop. We gotta stop. No. Two more stops, Frank.</p>
<p>Let's keep it moving. Let's drop it off at base camp.</p>
<p>No. No base camp. We gotta keep movin', Frank. March! No, it's fallin'.</p>
<p>ho! Do not lose that. Do not lose that. It's just a bottle.</p>
<p>All right, I think we gotta stop.</p>
<p>We gotta stop at the apartment.</p>
<p>No, dude. There's no time for that, man! We gotta drop some stuff off.</p>
<p>All right, fine. We'll make it quick. All right.</p>
<p>Charlie, maybe we should get rid of some of this shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean...</p>
<p>What'd you say, get rid of it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Frank, look at this. Huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This... This... Look at that, bro! Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>This here's our future, man. People are just throwin' this away. Get rid of it, dude?</p>
<p>Frank, we start gettin' rid of this, we're gonna be just like the wasters out there.</p>
<p>Look... Hey, guess what.</p>
<p>Somebody else is gonna find it.</p>
<p>Ah, you're right, you're right, you're right.</p>
<p>Well, where are we gonna sleep?</p>
<p>You sure you still wanna do this?</p>
<p>Mountain, this is what it's all about&#058; Me and my girl side-by-side... savin' a life, bringin' in the dawn together.</p>
<p>I mean, come on! Looks like it's gonna rain.</p>
<p>It does look like it's gonna rain.</p>
<p>Have you seen Asriel?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Wonder where she is.</p>
<p>Riders on the storm Tonight we cross the plane of reality...</p>
<p>Into the dimension of no place or time.</p>
<p>Open your mouth.</p>
<p>Become the journey.</p>
<p>Like a dog without a bone What are we doin', man? It's pourin' rain out here! We're actin' like animals.</p>
<p>But we gotta stick together, Frank, if we're gonna make it. Yeah, let's stick together.</p>
<p>All right. Let's use our heads. What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>We gotta get outta this rain.</p>
<p>Yeah. Where are we gonna go?</p>
<p>We could get in that Dumpster.</p>
<p>I'm not above that.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Asriel!</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Can you give me a bite of that, dude? Mmm. Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm starvin', you know.</p>
<p>Charlie, I'm really sorry that I banged your girlfriend.</p>
<p>Ah, bro, you gotta stop talkin' about that, dude.</p>
<p>I'm also sorry that I didn't get the blood test.</p>
<p>But I know... I'm a hundred percent positive... that I am not your dad.</p>
<p>Dude, how can you be a hundred percent positive, dude? How do you know?</p>
<p>Your mother and I were gonna keep this a secret, but... after we made love, she did get pregnant... but she had an abortion.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Are you sure she went through with it, dude? 'Cause maybe she didn't tell you.</p>
<p>I mean, she probably went right from the clinic and banged some guy and got knocked up... because your mother was a giant whore.</p>
<p>Ah, you know what, dude? I don't believe you, Frank, all right?</p>
<p>It's hard to take. Just...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You're a liar, man.</p>
<p>Girl, you gotta love your man Where are you goin', Charlie?</p>
<p>To find out the truth!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Make him understand Yeah Frank doesn't know the truth.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>All right. You didn't have an abortion, you just told him you did. I get that.</p>
<p>No. I had an abortion.</p>
<p>It just didn't take.</p>
<p>Wha... What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means, you survived it.</p>
<p>You survived the abortion. What the hell are you talking about, Mom?</p>
<p>W We went to one of those clinics... one of those underground clinics... because Frank didn't want to spend a lot of money... Yeah.</p>
<p>And I had the procedure, and then they told me you were dead... Okay.</p>
<p>And then three months later, you popped out, happy as a clam!</p>
<p>Sweetie, I had to keep it a secret from Frank.</p>
<p>I never wanted the abortion in the first place.</p>
<p>But he was married, and I knew, if he found out, he would have forced me... to get rid of you once and for all.</p>
<p>He would have made me throw you in a Dumpster.</p>
<p>Oh, my... God.</p>
<p>Nope. His skin needs to be darker, Dee. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>We're just gonna paint this bronzing lotion on him. Shoe polish.</p>
<p>Shoe polish?</p>
<p>Shoe polish.</p>
<p>Shoe polish on a baby?</p>
<p>You're such an idiot.</p>
<p>That's gonna look stupid and smell like shit. We'll see.</p>
<p>Where's D. B?</p>
<p>My door's open!</p>
<p>Did he get kidnapped?</p>
<p>Somebody came in and took him?</p>
<p>There's a note.</p>
<p>There's a note!</p>
<p>"Taked' baby. Meet at later bar, night or day sometime."</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Feast your eyes on this! Oh, my God, Charlie. Where did you get a baby?</p>
<p>I think you know good and well where I got this baby, now don't you?</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I'm talkin' about you and Frank... throwin' your love child here in the Dumpster behind Paddy's Pub!</p>
<p>What, did you think I wouldn't find out? Well, I did. Yeah. Yeah!</p>
<p>What you might not know, though, is that this little baby of yours... also happens to be my half brother.</p>
<p>Charlie, the incident with Frank happened three months ago.</p>
<p>It takes nine months to make a baby, so you can just give me the baby and stop screaming.</p>
<p>You know, there was a time where I would've helped you... raise this little Dumpster baby brother of mine like a son.</p>
<p>But that's gone now, 'cause you ruined it!</p>
<p>You threw your babies away!</p>
<p>And you threw your swords away!</p>
<p>You threw your golf clubs and your tasty treats!</p>
<p>And you know what? I found them.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna raise all of 'em!</p>
<p>Get me the number for Child Services.</p>
<p>Hey, Sage, buddy.</p>
<p>How are you, man?</p>
<p>How are you feelin'? Guh, I...</p>
<p>I did it. LI saved the tree.</p>
<p>You sure did, man. You saved that tree.</p>
<p>Wow. I gotta say, man, I'm really impressed.</p>
<p>I don't think I could've done what you did here today.</p>
<p>Guh, I'm a hero.</p>
<p>You are. You're a hero.</p>
<p>Yep. Guh... Come here.</p>
<p>Come here. Come with me.</p>
<p>Man, it is a good day to be alive.</p>
<p>It's a good day to be alive, isn't it?</p>
<p>Okay, guys.</p>
<p>She's all yours.</p>
<p>You might wanna see this.</p>
<p>I banged your girlfriend.</p>
<p>What time did he say? Uh, "later bar, night or day sometime. "</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, any of you guys seen that Ali Baba sword Charlie had? What?</p>
<p>The little shit dumped me in a Dumpster last night, and I'm takin' all his stuff.</p>
<p>It's every man for himself. I gotta find that Ali Baba sword.</p>
<p>Pour me a shot there, Dee.</p>
<p>I am the man.</p>

<p>Hey, Frank! You recognize this young man right here? Interrupt me. All right.</p>
<p>Or should I say, "Hey, Dad"?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's right, everybody.</p>
<p>Who would like to hear a mind-blowing story?</p>
<p>Nobody. Give us back our baby so we can paint it. Oh, you're gonna paint it, huh?</p>
<p>Well, be careful painting it, 'cause you'll be painting my brother.</p>
<p>But I guess you already knew that, didn't you, Dad?</p>
<p>What the hell are you talkin' about, Charlie?</p>
<p>I'm talkin' about you and the waitress dumpin' your baby in a Dumpster!</p>
<p>And the abortion that you tried to make my mom have? Well, guess what, Frankie.</p>
<p>It didn't take. I'm an abortion survivor, Dad! I survived the abortion, Dad!</p>
<p>Charlie! First of all, it takes nine months to have a baby.</p>
<p>That is not my baby.</p>
<p>Second of all, your mother is feedin' you a line of crap Holy shit. You guys kept the Ali Baba sword?</p>
<p>Gimme the sword! That's the sword I want. Back off, man.</p>
<p>It's my sword anyway Stop grabbin' it!</p>
