<p>Oh, my God. That's crazy.</p>
<p>I just got five grand from my dad.</p>
<p>Oh, dudes, that's perfect. I just got 25 cents, uh, from the machine over there.</p>
<p>25 cents is not gonna get us shit, man.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I mean, I just got it now.</p>
<p>I have more saved up. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Well, okay, well, how much do you have total?</p>
<p>From the machines and my paycheck and just, like, saving the quarters and shit, I've saved up, like, $57,000.</p>
<p>Holy shit, man.</p>
<p>Oh, that's-that's-that's...</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That actually might be enough for an equal partnership with us.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Equal doesn't quite make sense...</p>
<p>Hey, you know what, I'm starving. Do they have sandwiches here?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you know, they do have sandwiches.</p>
<p>Would you like a sandwich?</p>
<p>Yeah. You want something with meat on it?</p>
<p>The sandwiches are good, but, like...</p>
<p>I'm-I'm paying. I'll pay for the sandwich.</p>
<p>Equal just doesn't totally make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: Let's give it up for the Sweet Dee Skaters.</p>
<p>They're-they're starting the dance.</p>
<p>All right, here we go.</p>

<p>Ooh. That was brutal.</p>

<p>( <em>Panting</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, sis, are-are you okay?</p>
<p>You hit your head pretty hard there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm fine, you small-haired cuոt.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>What? Excuse me?</p>
<p>It was a joke, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, you don't understand humor?</p>
<p>It was a joke. That's why she was...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Hey-hey, Dee, um, we're gonna buy the rink.</p>
<p>Do you want to be part-owner with us?</p>
<p>( <em>Mockingly</em> ): Oh, oh, oh, are you?</p>
<p>Yeah, we could really use your positive attitude.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, could you?</p>
<p>( <em>Normal voice</em> ): You know what you could also use?</p>
<p>A breath mint 'cause your mouth smells like you just ate a giant slice of shit pizza.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm confused, Dee. D-Do you want to be in?</p>
<p>N-N-N-N-No, Charlie.</p>
<p>Thank you, anyway, but I don't want to be involved with you losers, okay? 'Cause you're losers.</p>
<p>I'm moving to Hollywood.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get rich, I'm gonna get famous, and I'm probably gonna marry Scott Wolf.</p>
<p>Get out of my way, bitch! Leave me alone!</p>
<p>Sweet Dee is not being very sweet.</p>
<p>You know what? She just got her bell rung.</p>
<p>She's gonna be fine.</p>
<p>Oh, dude, that's what it is, right?</p>
<p>I-I'm sure by tomorrow it'll wear off, and she'll be back to spreading her sunshine again, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, come on, let's go buy this rink.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right. Let's go buy a roller rink.</p>
<p>Smokey!</p>
<p>You want to buy my joint?</p>
<p>Absolutely, Smokey. I mean, look, uh, we heard you're selling it, and we-we want to be the buyers.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we will pay any price.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, well, hang-hang on a second.</p>
<p>No, we won't pay any price.</p>
<p>We'll pay the appropriate price for a roller rink.</p>
<p>The rink? ( <em>Scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>I don't own this place.</p>
<p>I just work here for the free parking.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I own the bar around the corner.</p>
<p>There's a bar around the corner?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That place is a real dump.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. Uh...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, we'll take it. Any price.</p>
<p>Well, well, hang on a second.</p>
<p>We don't know if we'll take it. We haven't even seen it yet.</p>
<p>Stop saying that.</p>
<p>You are a terrible negotiator. How do you...?</p>
<p>He's a really bad drug dealer, too, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Paddy's, huh?</p>
<p>You guys like that name?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>No, it's terrible.</p>
<p>It's pretty bad.</p>
<p>We'll change it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely. First thing we do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Should we check it out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Smells like fish. You guys smell that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It does smell like fish.</p>
<p>Get a cooler sign, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>'Cause it's kind of, like, old and wooden.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I mean, you know, doesn't-doesn't quite have the same pageantry as a roller rink, but, uh...</p>
<p>Well, there's a-a palpable sadness in here.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I feel that.</p>
<p>And a stink, right? Like... Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that said, I mean, you know, it's got potential.</p>
<p>Right. It doesn't have to be this, right?</p>
<p>Like, check it out.</p>
<p>We could gut this place, make it totally our own, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes!</p>
<p>Make it whatever we want.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. We could become really successful bar owners, right?</p>
<p>Of course we could, dude.</p>
<p>Like, the most successful bar owners in all of South Philadelphia, in all of the country.</p>
<p>That's reasonable.</p>
<p>Guys, mark my words, when we're finished with this place, you're not even gonna recognize it.</p>
<p>I got a lot of things wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. We really didn't change that much.</p>
<p>No. No, you haven't even changed clothes, for instance.</p>
<p>You're still wearing the same sweatshirt.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, can I talk to you guys about the, uh, percentage shares of the bar for a second?</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Uh...</p>
<p>Sandwiches. ( <em>Stammers</em> ) We were gonna get...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we-we got, uh, sandwiches.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got sandwiches from a place, and, uh...</p>
<p>Are you hungry?</p>
<p>Yeah, you hungry? You want a sandwich?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Let's get Charlie a sandwich.</p>
<p>I'm gonna check the sandwich thing out.</p>
