<p>Hello. Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I'm Deandra Reynolds, and thank you all so much for joining my acting class.</p>
<p>For starters...</p>
<p>I don't have a limp.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ) Right?</p>
<p>Don't be shy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>( <em>Scattered applause</em> )</p>
<p>Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, here's the thing, the first order of business, and perhaps the most important thing, is payment.</p>
<p>Now, did everyone have a chance to get cash or cashier's check?</p>
<p>Okay, good. Great.</p>
<p>Great, wonderful. Okay, well, let's get started.</p>
<p>( <em>Pen clicks</em> )</p>
<p>Chain saw, avocado, marlin. What'd I just say? You.</p>
<p>Um... chain saw, avocado, marlin?</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>Which is wrong.</p>
<p>You just violated the first rule of acting.</p>
<p>You listened.</p>
<p>When you are listening, you are not talking, and if you're not talking, you're not getting paid.</p>
<p>You know who doesn't talk throughout an entire movie?</p>
<p>An extra.</p>
<p>Which brings me to rule number two, acting is...</p>
<p>Oh, um, reacting.</p>
<p>Wrong again. Acting is ignoring.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Ignore reality.</p>
<p>You're in a casting office, not Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>Ignore your scene partner because you better goddamn believe they're ignoring you.</p>
<p>And, for Christ's sake, ignore the script, okay?</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) You're better than a writer, right?</p>
<p>Writers are dorks, okay?</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>No! Put your hands down!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Don't ask questions.</p>
<p>That shows you don't know something, which makes you look weak.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>Now, if we could circle back on the payment thing again, it's pretty important to me, okay?</p>
<p>'Cause I'm-I'm dead serious, you're not walking out of here without the payment.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Charlie, we're not going to Scranton.</p>
<p>All right, fine. What about Harrisburg? Williamsport?</p>
<p>Altoona? You know...</p>
<p>Okay, will you at least consider going someplace outside of Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>All those cities are in Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Like, you don't want to know... thank you, monkey... you don't want to know, like, how this shit works, man?</p>
<p>No. I don't want to find out how zoning districts work.</p>
<p>I don't care about that. Thank you, monkey.</p>
<p>I want to go somewhere exotic.</p>
<p>Baltimore?</p>
<p>Baltimore is not exotic, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No.</p>
<p>I'll tell you, I've seen shit happen in Baltimore that would blow your mind. Thank you, monkey.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You know what, guys? I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Regardless of where we decide to go, we're taking this goddamn monkey because I love this guy. I love him.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could hire more monkeys to do our job for us while we're gone.</p>
<p>Like, a team of monkeys who run the bar, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, 'cause they're all out of work now, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, because Hollywood decided you can't beat 'em no more, so they had to set 'em all free.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Are you seriously?</p>
<p>You can't beat monkeys?</p>
<p>No, you can't.</p>
<p>At all?</p>
<p>Those monkeys don't even have jobs anymore 'cause of these snowflakes?</p>
<p>Not allowed to do it no more.</p>
<p>These Hollywood...</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I do have to admit, though, it-it is a little disappointing to, um, discover that a team of primates could do our jobs for us, but...</p>
<p>( <em>Stammers</em> ) I'm gonna blow past it because I really do want to come up with a vacation spot for us, you know?</p>
<p>So, here's what I'm thinking, guys.</p>
<p>E-Everybody grab a napkin there, okay?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Grab a napkin.</p>
<p>And, uh, everybody write down a destination on the napkin, and then we'll put that destination in this bowl right here, I'll pick one out, and that way not one of us decides...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>...but we let fate take over.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about that plan?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Kiki</strong>: I didn't say that I don't love you.</p>
<p>Then what is it?</p>
<p>Is it my gang ties? Because I don't need that shit.</p>
<p>I'll leave it all behind.</p>
<p>Just tell me what's wrong.</p>
<p>( <em>Mouthing along</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Kiki</strong>: The baby...</p>
<p>It's not yours. It's my... my... my father's.</p>
<p>Bigger.</p>
<p>( <em>Inhales</em> ) My father's!</p>
<p>N... louder.</p>

<p>Your father's?!</p>
<p>Louder.</p>
<p>( <em>Yelling</em> ): Your father's?!</p>
<p>Okay! Now, this is what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Nice work. ( <em>Applauds</em> ) Do you all see that?</p>
<p>Goddamn, that's what I want. I want to be able to see your performance from the fucking moon.</p>
<p>Guys, the louder you are, the more people have to pay attention to you.</p>
<p>Yeah... ( <em>Sighs</em> ) Yeah, I-I don't understand the script.</p>
<p>What movie did you say this was from?</p>
<p>I-I didn't. I wrote it.</p>
<p>It's a mash-up of Chinatown and Tupac Shakur's Poetic Justice.</p>
<p>Oh. Are you, are you gonna write all the scenes?</p>
<p>Well, there you go asking a bunch of questions again, Tony.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ) Uh, Kiki, how does that make him seem to you?</p>
<p>Um... weak?</p>
<p>Weak! Good. Very good.</p>
<p>Now, you, Kiki, you're really getting this.</p>
<p>But did you feel that?</p>
<p>Did you feel how he went from, like, a hot stud you'd like to bang to a weak little bitch right before your eyes? Right?</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn't mean I still wouldn't do him, but that's between him and me.</p>
<p>Tony, see me after class.</p>
<p>Um... Okay.</p>
<p>Wrong! Wrong! Okay.</p>
<p>People in power will try and bang you.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes it will be necessary to get the part, but assess the situation.</p>
<p>Why go all the way when a simple hand job will suffice?</p>
<p>Tony, do see me after class.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: And the place that we're going to is...</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) "Yell"... "Yellow"?</p>
<p>What is, what is this? Who, who wrote this?</p>
<p>Uh... ( <em>Stammers</em> ) Me. Yeah.</p>
<p>W-Were you trying to s-say Yellowstone or...?</p>
<p>Uh... no. Uh, just yellow.</p>
<p>Just yellow? Just the color yellow?</p>
<p>Uh, well, I panicked.</p>
<p>You know, you were shooting down all the other places I've been naming, so I-I couldn't think of something.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that's not a goddamn place, you idiot, so..</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> ) We're gonna try this again.</p>
<p>Next place I pick out, that's where we're gonna go.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>"Purple."</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>( <em>Burps</em> ) That was me. Yeah, I did purple.</p>
<p>You did purple? Two of you wrote colors?</p>
<p>Yeah, I...</p>
<p>Okay, so you thought of a color, too?</p>
<p>I didn't understand the assignment either.</p>
<p>It-it was not clear.</p>
<p>I said write down a destination, and two people wrote down colors?</p>
<p>We're sorry, we're sorry.</p>
<p>I don't understand...</p>
<p>I like purple.</p>
<p>I like purple, too, Frank. That's why I wrote it down.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we could go there. That could be pretty.</p>
<p>Go where?! Purple? That's not a place!</p>
<p>That... All right, you know...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Okay, you're right.</p>
<p>I think, um... these beers are a little strong.</p>
<p>Are you drunk?</p>
<p>I... these beers are a little strong...</p>
<p>I will admit that the beers are also stronger than I was anticipating.</p>
<p>I like this beer.</p>
<p>You know what, guys?</p>
<p>I'm having a lot of fun here.</p>
<p>Uh, but I do want to figure this out, so, new plan.</p>
<p>All right, here's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>Instead of writing down places, why don't we write down key words?</p>
<p>Or phrases, you know?</p>
<p>Let's go with our instincts, you know?</p>
<p>Whatever we want to feel, what-whatever we want to experience on the vacation, okay? And then we'll put it up on a board.</p>
<p>We'll look at it all together and then maybe the destination will just reveal itself to us.</p>
<p>And... we can drink more monkey beer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Monkey!</p>
<p>We'll drink monkey beer while we're doing it.</p>
<p>Monkey.</p>

<p>What the hell is happening?</p>
<p>( <em>Clears throat</em> ) Guys, wake up.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Wake...</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Wha...</p>
<p>Oh, my God. My head is killing me.</p>
<p>Oh, dude. I am very hungover. I do not feel good.</p>
<p>Charlie, you're full of scratches.</p>
<p>So are you.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Wait, I got scratches, too.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. ( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>Dude, Mac, I think you got bit in the neck, man.</p>
<p>( <em>Winces</em> )</p>
<p>Is that shit on the bar?</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>What-what is that... sour, salty taste in my mouth? Do you guys have that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got that.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, I have that.</p>
<p>What is that? ( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, it's real bad.</p>
<p>Uh-oh, guys...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, yeah, I feel like shit.</p>
<p>I think we've been outsmarted.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>( <em>Scoffs</em> ) The monkey got us drunk, assaulted us, robbed the bar, and possibly fucked our mouths.</p>
<p>( <em>Retching</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Yeah, he did. That is what happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, the guy who sold him to me did say something like this could happen.</p>
<p>He did?!</p>
<p>Yeah. Apparently, the monkey's grandfather was Fatty Arbuckle's monkey, and you know how these things go.</p>
<p>These monkeys are passed down from one Hollywood creep to the next, until, eventually, they wind up under a bridge in Philly getting drunk and pulling scams.</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> ) Goddamn. All right.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>All right, all right, we got to think about this. All right, so let's not take the monkey on our vacation.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>The vacation. I think we landed on a vacation destination last night.</p>
<p>Yeah, we did, we did. Look, look, look.</p>
<p>Oh, look at the board.</p>
<p>We did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We got something on here. Let's um...</p>
<p>Okay, should we see where we're going?</p>
<p>Yeah, where are we going?</p>
<p>Where we going? Where we going?</p>
<p>All right, here we go...</p>
<p>"Monkey beer island of green and fight."</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) Goddamn it.</p>
<p>That's not a place.</p>
<p>That's not a place?</p>
<p>No, it's not!</p>
<p>No, it's not a goddamn place. You know what this is?</p>
<p>This is the ramblings of four men who got very, very drunk last night on a mystery concoction invented by a wild animal.</p>
<p>( <em>Whimpers</em> ) Why can't we just be normal?</p>
<p>That is what it is.</p>
<p>That's so weird.</p>
<p>Why would we do that?</p>
<p>Because the monkey beers were so delicious.</p>
<p>All right? That-that-that monkey may have been a pervert, but he was also a genius, which is often the case in Hollywood.</p>
<p>You know what I'm thinking? 'Cause I'm seeing a lot of empty whiskey bottles around, I'm thinking maybe that monkey was just pouring, like, half a bottle of whiskey in each beer.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>That could be.</p>
<p>Based on my hangover, I think that's what I'm, that's what I'm feeling.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) Goddamn it.</p>
<p>That tracks, that tracks.</p>
<p>So, monkey beer is just whiskey...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Whiskey-beer, yeah.</p>
<p>...beer?</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>"Whiskey beer island of green and fight."</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p>We're nowhere. We're nowhere.</p>
<p>Hey-o! Whoa, what the hell happened...</p>
<p>Eh, you know what? Don't care.</p>
<p>Do not even care 'cause guess what, dick nips.</p>
<p>This big, dumb, flightless bird just booked a huge acting gig.</p>
<p>Why don't you feast your eyes on "Obnoxious American MILF #1"?</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>In your faces. That's right.</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
<p>And guess what. I leave tomorrow morning at 6:30 a.m. on a first-class flight 'cause it shoots in Ireland, baby.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Body slam!</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>I mean, she doesn't... She comes in screaming.</p>
<p>That was the worst.</p>
<p>Screaming.</p>
<p>Cackling like a witch.</p>
<p>Just screaming and screeching, like... ( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>( <em>Gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>( <em>Gasps</em> )</p>
<p>What? What is it?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Uh, you don't know?</p>
<p>Right? It wasn't clear.</p>
<p>Frank looked at me...</p>
<p>Why did you guys act like you knew what it was, then?</p>
<p>I don't know. We were all getting excited together.</p>
<p>I was excited... ( <em>Stammers</em> )</p>
<p>And, yeah, uh...</p>
<p>Goddamn it. Frank, you tell them what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p>I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>You don't...</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, we don't know, uh, we don't know what it is.</p>
<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<p>"Whiskey beer island of green and fight."</p>
<p>That's Ireland.</p>
<p>Goddamn, you guys.</p>
<p>What is this delicious drink? This is good.</p>
<p>I was gonna go home and get some sleep, but I might have to get a couple soda pops in first, you know what I mean? Nice job.</p>
<p>Mmm. Mmm.</p>
