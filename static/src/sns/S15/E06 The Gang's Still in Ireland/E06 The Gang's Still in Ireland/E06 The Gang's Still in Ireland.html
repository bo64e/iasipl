<p>Okay, so, I used to be Irish, and now I'm Dutch.</p>
<p>Of course, I was badass the entire time, but when you surround yourself with people who aren't as badass as you, that tends to be quite isolating.</p>

<p>Either way, Father, what I have decided is that the most important aspect of my identity... it's not being gay.</p>
