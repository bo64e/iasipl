<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Attention!</p>
<p>Attention, everyone!</p>
<p>Gather round, please!</p>
<p>Gather round!</p>
<p>Mac has a very important announcement!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Because of my sudden and unfortunate weight loss, the bar is now in extreme risk.</p>
<p>And as head of security, this concerns me.</p>
<p>So Mac's made a couple of moves.</p>
<p>And that first move... is this.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p>Perfect for ocular pat-downs.</p>
<p>Now I can determine a subject's threat level without him being able to feel my retinal assessment.</p>
<p>Which is a great advantage because the guy can't see how scared Mac is.</p>
<p>Yes, and... No, that's not what it's about. It's not...</p>
<p>Huh? Oh, I thought that you were scared every time you went to go to...</p>
<p>That's classified!</p>
<p>Look, this whole point is to make them feel safer, all right?</p>
<p>We <em>don't</em> feel safer.</p>
<p>And, Mac, there will never come a time where you will need those.</p>
<p>Mark my words, Dennis, there will come a time when I will utilize these glasses to assess a threat and then...</p>
<p>Are they still standing there?</p>
<p>No, they walked away.</p>
<p>My peripheral is a little compromised.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can't see out the sides, and that's a disadvantage, so...</p>
<p>(sighs): Oh, good... you're all here.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Who invited the Jew lawyer?</p>
<p>Not Jewish.</p>
<p>Hold on, punk.</p>
<p>He's clear.</p>
<p>He's clear.</p>
<p>You know, I-I really do not understand you people.</p>
<p>You know, it's funny, most of the time I'm trying to get away from you, and yet when I really need to get in touch with you, I can't get you to return my phone calls.</p>
<p>Mmm, don't need you, don't care.</p>
<p>Eh... out you go.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>As the executor of your mother's estate, I'm here to inform you that her father, Heinrich Landgraf, has fallen into a coma.</p>
<p>Pop-Pop?</p>
<p>He's being kept alive by a respirator.</p>
<p>As per the will, the only living blood relatives, the ever-charming Dee and Dennis Reynolds are the only people empowered to decide whether or not he stays on those machines.</p>
<p>Are you saying that we have to decide whether that old Nazi bitch lives or dies?</p>
<p>There's that charm.</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>I'll await your decision.</p>
<p>("Ride of the Valkyries" plays)</p>
<p>Pop-Pop's room's right down here.</p>
<p>How do you know, Frank?</p>
<p>I come here every week and feed him soup, take care of him.</p>
<p>That's nice of you, you know?</p>
<p>Help a man keep his dignity in his final years.</p>
<p>Somebody's got to do it.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>I didn't have a chance to tidy.</p>
<p>T... Tidy?</p>
<p>Frank, the man is rotting.</p>
<p>Oh, God, why hasn't someone done something in here?</p>
<p>I told the staff I got it.</p>
<p>You <em>don't</em> got it.</p>
<p>You don't have it at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is the overwhelming smell?</p>
<p>Oh, that's the soup.</p>
<p>(several groans)</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if he doesn't finish, sometimes I leave 'em for him, and then I forget and then months go by.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank, what the hell is really going on here?</p>
<p>Look, the guy always said he had Nazi treasure stashed away.</p>
<p>I figure I spend some time with him, he gives it to me.</p>
<p>All right, well, pretty good plan; execution leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Okay, well, speaking of execution, we're just gonna pull the plug on this creep and get out of here, right?</p>
<p>Whoa. Whoa, h-hold on a second, Dee, I mean, that's a big decision.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>We're talking about taking a man's life.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he was a Nazi, so it's kind of, like, eh...</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I get that, but, I mean, he was our grandfather.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe we got to think this through a little bit more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, make a decision already!</p>
<p>(gasps): Are you eating the soup?!</p>
<p>Is he eating the soup?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I was hungry.</p>
<p>I made a decision to eat the soup.</p>
<p>I didn't sit around thinking all day, "Hey, do I do this?</p>
<p>Do I not do this?"</p>
<p>We are making a decision about whether or not to take a man's life, not whether or not to eat old rancid soups.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, I think we just need to gather a little bit more information before we make our decision, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys think it over, think it over.</p>
<p>Mac, can you come here for a second?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>All Frank's talk about Nazi treasure... got me thinking about something.</p>
<p>Okay, you remember that box of stuff Pop-Pop gave me a few years ago?</p>
<p>It was, like, all this old stuff, Nazi shit that he got from the war?</p>
<p>(distorted): Holy shit!</p>
<p>Yeah. Didn't we burn that all in the alley?</p>
<p>Not all of it.</p>
<p>There was a painting in that box, a very special dog painting that I mounted on my wall.</p>
<p>You and my dad share this futon?</p>
<p>Now, Frank hated this painting, you know?</p>
<p>He made me take it down.</p>
<p>I do not like this painting, Charlie.</p>
<p>Its smug aura mocks me.</p>
<p>It's evil, Charlie.</p>
<p>(echoes): Evil.</p>
<p>And it's been in that box ever since.</p>
<p>(slurps): Uh-huh. So what?</p>
<p>(slurps)</p>
<p>By the way, man, this is why we work well together, you know?</p>
<p>You see free soup, you make a decision to eat it.</p>
<p>It's horrible.</p>
<p>It's terrible soup, but we got to stick with our decisions, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can't go back on it now.</p>
<p>No, no. All right, anyway... do you think that that painting could've been the Nazi treasure that Frank's looking for?</p>
<p>Mm. I've made a decision.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. You got to help me find it.</p>
<p>Let's slip out of here so they don't notice.</p>
<p>Okay. They're standing two feet away from us, so they <em>are gonna notice, but let's just run out of here; they'll think we made a quick decision to leave.</p>
<p>Damn it, dude!</p>
<p>All right, I remember exactly what happened, all right?</p>
<p>Frank took it down, told me to get rid of it; I stashed it away somewhere, but then what-what happened to it from there, I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, come here.</p>
<p>Dude, you got to check this out.</p>
<p>Look at all these old photos of Hitler with German shepherds.</p>
<p>Oh, holy shit.</p>
<p>Yeah. But check this out.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Yeah. Hitler painted German shepherds all the time.</p>
<p>He was, like, obsessed.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm thinking that maybe that painting could be...</p>
<p>An original Hitler.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude, this is huge!</p>
<p>We are gonna become famous treasure hunters.</p>
<p>I'm thinking, Hollywood is gonna make a Da Vinci Code</em> style thriller about us!</p>
<p>I can finally be Indiana Jones!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and then I get it back on my wall!</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, we're not gonna put it back up on your wall.</p>
<p>It'll probably go in a museum.</p>
<p>What? No-no-no-no-no.</p>
<p>It looks so good here.</p>
<p>It belongs in a museum, and that's the end of this.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, can you call Frank?</p>
<p>Because he's gonna remember the details.</p>
<p>I knew that I stashed it away somewhere, but it's-it's gone.</p>
<p>I can't find it.</p>
<p>Do we have to involve Frank?</p>
<p>You know what, yeah, we'll just tiptoe around the language.</p>
<p>I'll play it cool.</p>
<p>Just play it cool.</p>
<p>(line rings)</p>
<p>(grunting): Mac!</p>
<p>Hey, Frank.</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>You sound strained.</p>
<p>I'm stuck in a window over at Pop-Pop's house.</p>
<p>I got to find this treasure.</p>
<p>Treasure, what treasure?</p>
<p>I don't even know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>There probably is no treasure.</p>
<p>I'll bet you there's no treasure, so you can just stop looking for the treasure, okay, 'cause there's no treasure.</p>
<p>Hey, man, you know where that, um, worthless old dog painting that you had hanging up in your apartment-- do you know where that might be?</p>
<p>The dog painting? Oh!</p>
<p>That was evil.</p>
<p>I threw that thing out.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I saw Cricket scampering away with it.</p>
<p>Cricket?</p>
<p>Hey, listen, Mac.</p>
<p>You do me a favor.</p>
<p>I'm really stuck in this window.</p>
<p>Will you come and get me?</p>
<p>Okay, nice.</p>
<p>We got to get Cricket.</p>
<p>I know just where to find him.</p>
<p>Dust is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Yes. I don't like you wearing the glasses, though.</p>
<p>They're supposed to assess a threat.</p>
<p>Oh, Cricket could be a threat.</p>
<p>No, I have cleared him on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Here we go. Hello!</p>
<p>Hey, Cricks.</p>
<p>(singing)</p>
<p>Dog pound, huh? Weird.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Ugh. Ooh.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ, that's gruesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got into a skirmish with a stray chocolate lab.</p>
<p>I won't go into details, but suffice to say, that dog is very paralyzed now.</p>
<p>Anyway, they got me doing this, uh, this community service thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I'm kind of a dog executioner, so, uh, looks like old Cricket got the last laugh.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're putting the dogs down?</p>
<p>Well, uh, no.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, mostly just, you know, cleaning up the poops, you know, washing out their cages, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Ah. Sounds like you're a dog janitor then.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's more like <em>they got the last laugh.</p>
<p>Cricks, Frank said you know something about a dog painting that he threw away that you might have scampered off with.</p>
<p>Yeah, worthless</em> dog painting.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, dog painting, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, very evil vibes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I sold it.</p>
<p>To who?</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh, some guy.</p>
<p>You know, he's coming down here, he's all bent out of shape, you know, that he had to put down his German shepherd.</p>
<p>Well, I notice his dog looks just like the one in the painting.</p>
<p>I see an opportunity.</p>
<p>Make three bucks. Ba-da-boom!</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>He's cool. He's not a threat.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>I know he's not a threat!</p>
<p>I told you, I've assessed him...</p>
<p>I've just cleared him.</p>
<p>You are not using the glasses correctly, and it's driving me crazy, okay?</p>
<p>I thought I used it.</p>
<p>Could you tell how scared I was?</p>
<p>No, I could not. I could not.</p>
<p>Mara?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, boss.</p>
<p>Got a mastiff in here, just had explosive diarrhea.</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>Get your ass in here.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Hello? Somebody there?</p>
<p>Help me out of here!</p>
<p>I'm stuck! I can't get out of here!</p>
<p>Frank? What is happening?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm trapped.</p>
<p>That goddamn trunk is booby-trapped.</p>
<p>It's not booby-trapped, Frank; it's an empty trunk, and you fell into it like a Weeble wobble.</p>
<p>Let's go. Come on.</p>
<p>(Frank groans)</p>
<p>Jesus!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>(Frank mutters)</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Frank, there's no point in you looking for a treasure, okay?</p>
<p>If there's anything of value in this house, we are the ones who inherit it once he dies.</p>
<p>You're wasting your time.</p>
<p>I mean, it's crazy.</p>
<p>Dennis, check out these old films-- "New Years '74,"</p>
<p>"Thanksgiving '68."</p>
<p>Way.</p>
<p>"Summer Camp '81."</p>
<p>'81? Oh, that's us.</p>
<p>That's our summer camp.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's us. Yeah.</p>
<p>Fire that up.</p>
<p>I want to check that out.</p>
<p>Oh, see, Frank, Dee and I have been talking, and I don't think we're gonna... I don't think we're gonna off Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, yeah, sure, the guy's got a little bit of a sordid past, absolutely, but you know, everybody deserves a second chance.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was just following orders.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's not try and justify why a man would join the Nazis and...</p>
<p>Right. Right, right, right, yeah, I see what you're saying.</p>
<p>'Cause that's gonna get us too far away from...</p>
<p>We won't be able to...</p>
<p>...the point that we're trying to make, which is that the man moved to America, you know, to put all that horrible shit behind him.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>And he wanted to turn his life around, and that's what he did, Frank.</p>
<p>He turned his life around.</p>
<p>People do that.</p>
<p>People do that. Exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go. Look at me.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, God, you remember that car?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, look at those two little rug rats.</p>
<p>Oh, I was so cute!</p>
<p>Oh, man, and look at Pop...</p>
<p>Look at how sweet he is!</p>
<p>Yeah, God, he was a sweet guy.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>That's the camp.</p>
<p>Oh, we loved it there.</p>
<p>God, it's... it's all flooding back to me now.</p>
<p>Did we wear those uniforms?</p>
<p>I don't remember those. Do you?</p>
<p>I don't remember that.</p>
<p>But yeah, see if there's sound.</p>
<p>I want to... I'd like to pop some sound on.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Look at this guy.</p>
<p>Remember this guy? Ah.</p>
<p>I totally remember that guy.</p>
<p>He was always so jazzed up about everything.</p>
<p>He was so excited, and he would get us all excited, do you remember that?</p>
<p>Get the whole crowd jazzed up, the whole camp.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>That is why it is so important that we all must unify.</p>
<p>The more we come together, the stronger we become.</p>
<p>Now, listen close, kids.</p>
<p>These goddamn niggers and Jews are trying to take over this country, and we've got to take it back!</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That just took a turn.</p>

<p><em>Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil!</em></p>
<p>(Sweet Dee groans)</p>
<p>Oh, that's us.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm doing that.</p>
<p>Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg...</p>
<p>Okay, that settles it.</p>
<p>Let's fry this turkey.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>(turns projector off)</p>
<p>All set?</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, hang on.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Are you sure you want to watch him die?</p>
<p>What do you mean, watch him die?</p>
<p>We have to watch him die?</p>
<p>Well, you do something like pull the plug, and you got to stay there until the lights go out.</p>
<p>You know, maybe we need to experience that on a smaller scale first, and just kind of see how we feel about it?</p>
<p>Kill something less important first.</p>
<p>See what that does inside.</p>
<p>Move up.</p>
<p>I have an idea.</p>
<p>You want to watch a dog get put down?</p>
<p>Yeah, we want to see how it feels.</p>
<p>Great. I got just the one.</p>
<p>Ah, I feel like we need to pick the dog.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>'Cause we need to feel the full weight of the decision.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Come on. No.</p>
<p>Uh... no.</p>
<p>Oh. No!</p>
<p>Oh. Come on, guy. No!</p>
<p>Pick me?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Put me down! Pick me!</p>
<p>I deserve it.</p>
<p>Okay. New plan.</p>
<p>We're doing the right thing, Dennis.</p>
<p>We're not killers.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>No, we have to think about ourselves here.</p>
<p>I don't want to live with pulling the plug on somebody.</p>
<p>No. Let's just let Pop-Pop and Cricket and these dogs die as nature intended.</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right, guys.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>Go, get out of here.</p>
<p>Go and be free. Go and be free.</p>
<p>Oh, we're all free.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>We're all free. Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm one of you guys.</p>
<p>All right, so this is the address.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is the spot, huh?</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Okay. "Bret Da Lawyer, a Denial Correlation."</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Pretty good. That's close.</p>
<p>It's "Brett DeLauter, a Dental Corporation."</p>
<p>Guy's a dentist.</p>
<p>Huh. All right, let's check it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Mac, look. There it is.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Holy shit, this dentist must have gone insane after his dog died.</p>
<p>I mean, look at this.</p>
<p>Charlie, I'm beginning to think that we may have stumbled onto one of the greatest discoveries of modern times.</p>
<p>Follow me here.</p>
<p>What if the key to Adolf Hitler's madness was the death of his dog?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, when he was a kid, he had this little, sweet, little puppy, and he was the happiest chap in all of Germany.</p>
<p>Right, "I love chocolate.</p>
<p>I love my dogs."</p>
<p>Yeah, but then his beloved pet was ripped from him, and he was like, "That's it.</p>
<p>I'm totally going to kill everybody, take over the world."</p>
<p>That is what happened.</p>
<p>I mean, that's definitely what happened.</p>
<p>Oh, hi, you must be Mr.</p>
<p>Miller.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ready for those braces?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wanted the...</p>
<p>Yeah, we can go in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We can pop in real quick.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm telling you, this is like The Da Vinci Code.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I wonder who's going to play me.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe Mark Wahlberg.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Hmm, no, you're right, he couldn't match my intensity.</p>
<p>Ryan Gosling-- it's locked in.</p>
<p>It's gonna be Ryan Gosling.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get that painting back up on my wall.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That's what this is really all about when you think about it.</p>
<p>No, that's not what this is about.</p>
<p>This is about ripping open the fabric of historical fact and making a film about it starring Ryan Gosling as Mac.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I'll play Hitler, then.</p>
<p>That'd be cool.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I play Hitler in the movie.</p>
<p>Okay, Hitler's not even in it.</p>
<p>It takes place in present day.</p>
<p>Oh, it could be a time- traveling thing.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying.</p>
<p>So then Hitler comes back from the past, he joins us on our adventure, we go on a big caper together.</p>
<p>There's no, there's no time travel in this movie.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a classic like Citizen Kane.</p>
<p>Time travel movies are classic.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>This is gonna be-- this is...</p>
<p>You're driving me-- oh, my God.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Mac, I need you to convince Dennis and Deandra not to pull the plug on Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I haven't found his treasure yet.</p>
<p>I need more time.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank, here's the deal.</p>
<p>Pop-Pop does have treasure, and I'll let you in on it if you help me because Charlie is driving me bananas.</p>
<p>He's becoming a threat to this whole operation.</p>
<p>Then you're going to have to take him out of the picture.</p>
<p>Get rid of him.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, you know, I was thinking, maybe you could play Hitler.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I think you've got the range.</p>
<p>I know I do, Mac.</p>
<p>And I think you're right.</p>
<p>I mean, the leader of the Third Reich defying laws of physics to join us in our present-day adventure-- that makes sense.</p>
<p>It's a better movie.</p>
<p>Good call.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've also decided to direct.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, let's lock that in.</p>
<p>Yeah, is that...?</p>
<p>What is-- what are you doing?</p>
<p>Why are you doing that?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Oh, I am so happy that you have decided to end this.</p>
<p>As soon as we get this little issue resolved, I'll no longer have a legal obligation to deal with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not really resolved, I think, in the sense that you were hoping for.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When we said we were gonna end this, we didn't mean "kill."</p>
<p>Not end it.</p>
<p>(attorney stammering)</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>We're not going to do it.</p>
<p>We're not going to do it.</p>
<p>We, we don't want a man's death on our hands.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, you don't want the man's blood on your hands, you don't want to give the order, then, fine, I'll give.</p>
<p>Just grant me power of attorney, and I'll give the order myself.</p>
<p>You would do that?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, Frank, Gosling has got to be the one because he's the only one that can handle my intensity.</p>
<p>God, you're obsessed with Ryan Gosling.</p>
<p>Well, no, I just think... Charlie?</p>
<p>Mac, you know the best thing about time travel movies?</p>
<p>They're full of surprises.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Beautiful painting you've got there.</p>
<p>Too bad it's the wrong one.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>That's not... this is the painting.</p>
<p>You got the wrong painting.</p>
<p>I don't know, they look exactly alike.</p>
<p>Silence, fools.</p>
<p>This has gone on long enough.</p>
<p>This painting clearly causes madness in men.</p>
<p>And it must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Charlie, no, no destroying that painting.</p>
<p>That's a piece of history.</p>
<p>That's the key to Hitler's madness.</p>
<p>Oh, this?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I painted this.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I painted it and I loved it, so I saw an opportunity to get it back, but now I'm realizing that this painting is making us all crazy-- crazy.</p>
<p>Hitler's painting, the key to the Holocaust, Ryan Gosling playing you?</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>This has to end now, and so I have the final solution.</p>
<p>I'm going to burn this painting and you can't stop me.</p>
<p>We won't.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dude, if that's not an original Hitler, then who gives a shit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Did you like my whole, my whole thing I was doing there?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(monitor beeping)</p>
<p>I need final verbal confirmation.</p>
<p>Yes, just do it already.</p>
<p>Wow, what an asshole, huh, Doctor?</p>
<p>You are killing a man.</p>
<p>You know that, right?</p>
<p>There's a lot of mercy in this decision.</p>
<p>I commend it.</p>
<p>Oh, you commend-- well, you know, I mean, technically we gave the order to him to, to give to you, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, if you feel like commending-- if you're in the mood for commending, you could...</p>
<p>Right, if you're gonna throw some commendations around, you know, just...</p>
<p>We'll take 'em.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(monitor beeping)</p>
<p>(monitor flatlines)</p>
<p>(Dennis whistles)</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>(beeping resumes)</p>
<p>Uh-oh, here we go.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Uh, he seems to be breathing on his own.</p>
<p>That happens sometimes.</p>
<p>Uh, how long until he's not breathing on his own?</p>
<p>Until he perishes?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Could be months, weeks, days.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>He's a fighter, this one.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Well, if you'll excuse me, we've had an incredible amount of stray dog attacks all over the city, so our E.R. is slammed.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>(Dennis chuckles nervously)</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>It's okay, let's go.</p>
<p>He had nothing of value to leave us anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, come on.</p>
<p>Well, actually he did.</p>
<p>Burn, baby, burn.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm still psyched about this movie.</p>
<p>Okay, the ending needs a little bit of work 'cause nobody cares about an original Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>Well, it's not an original, you know.</p>
<p>I just painted over one of the old paintings that he gave me, so...</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>So Pop-Pop did give you the painting?</p>
<p>Well, it was in the box of junk that he gave me, but it's just trash.</p>
<p>That's an even worse ending.</p>
<p>It's so complicated.</p>
<p>I can't even follow the goddamn story.</p>
<p>I-I don't care.</p>
<p>Dude, Gosling.</p>
<p>Gosling will not play you!</p>
