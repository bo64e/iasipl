<p>(laughter)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Pretty crowded tonight, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, well, it's Gugino's, you know, best restaurant in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To our monthly dinner.</p>
<p>Oh, monthly dinner, baby.</p>
<p>I tell you, I've been looking forward to this for... 29 days!</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>I did my hair good, and I wore two colognes.</p>
<p>Is that what that is?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>That was an interesting choice, but I get it, dude.</p>
<p>You're excited.</p>
<p>You are excited about tonight.</p>
<p>Hey, hell, I'm excited tonight, you know?</p>
<p>(music blares from the kitchen)</p>
<p>Not terribly excited about being near the kitchen, though.</p>
<p>Really? It's where the action is.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll get lucky and watch one of these dumb-ass waiters spill spaghetti sauce all over himself.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>And fall down or something.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Well, let's not be childish.</p>
<p>Let's-let's keep it classy.</p>
<p>You know, let's... Classy.</p>
<p>I can do classy.</p>
<p>I can be classy.</p>
<p>Did you invite Frank and Charlie?</p>
<p>No, I didn't.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>How many will you guys be?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Two. And give us a nice table.</p>
<p>This is a big night for us.</p>
<p>We're celebrating our anniversary.</p>
<p>Or the anniversary of us moving in together, which is like an anniver-- it's been a long time.</p>
<p>Anniversary is what it is, really.</p>
<p>Well, great.</p>
<p>Uh... oh, okay, oh, okay, uh...</p>
<p>You can just hand that to me.</p>
<p>I was trying to feel your breast.</p>
<p>I got that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he was trying to feel your breast and give you the tip so that we got a good table.</p>
<p>I want a good table.</p>
<p>Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>Mac and Dennis are here.</p>
<p>Should we sit with them?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Mm, Charlie, this is our night.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we could all celebrate it together.</p>
<p>That'd be fun.</p>
<p>We can do our thing.</p>
<p>They can do their thing.</p>
<p>I'm sure at some point they'll come over to pay tribute.</p>
<p>We can say hi to them then.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>I know Charlie sees me, but they seem to be sitting at their own table.</p>
<p>Well, good.</p>
<p>Good, they should sit at their own table.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sure at some point they'll come over and they'll pay tribute to us.</p>
<p>They know it's our monthly dinner.</p>
<p>We can say hi to them then.</p>
<p>Yeah, still, seems kind of awkward, though.</p>
<p>No. Look, we spend every waking minute together.</p>
<p>It will be good for us to keep our distance for once.</p>
<p>It's one minor coincidence.</p>
<p>Doesn't go any further than that.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Goddamn it.</p>
<p>(opera music playing)</p>
<p>Of all the goddamn nights.</p>
<p>Can't believe they haven't come over to pay me tribute yet.</p>
<p>I was here first.</p>
<p>I know they see me.</p>
<p>They're probably over there right now making fun of me.</p>
<p>I get it, guys.</p>
<p>You know what they're doing?</p>
<p>They're calling me "Scarecrow."</p>
<p>'Cause I'm all alone in the cornfields, scaring away the other birds.</p>
<p>Real funny.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>There's no shame in a woman, an adult woman, taking herself out to dinner, enjoying her own company-- I'm not gonna leave.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna leave because I don't have to, and also I can't because I have a Groupon for this evening that expires tonight.</p>
<p>It does expire tonight, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>I... Yes, it does.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you going to order now?</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.</p>
<p>Why don't you sit down for a little while?</p>
<p>Take a break.</p>
<p>Oh! Are you almost off?</p>
<p>Are you off soon?</p>
<p>Should you sit and have dinner with me tonight?</p>
<p>No, got a long shift.</p>
<p>Uh, I cannot do that.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe I could at least get a drink order?</p>
<p>We're really busy tonight.</p>
<p>Does the Groupon cover drinks?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Just the tap water, then.</p>
<p>I can't believe this.</p>
<p>They still haven't paid tribute.</p>
<p>It's been ten minutes.</p>
<p>Not a wave, not a nod.</p>
<p>Have you seen them do anything to acknowledge us?</p>
<p>I thought we agreed that we would not let it get to us.</p>
<p>It's not getting to me.</p>
<p>It's just, you know, a little bit rude, is all I'm saying.</p>
<p>It's, you know, irritating.</p>
<p>Whatever, I don't care.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm over it.</p>
<p>'Kay.</p>
<p>How good is their table, though?</p>
<p>Oh, um... Don't-don't look directly at them.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, just, you know, glance around the room a little bit, and just, you know, land on them.</p>
<p>Glance around the room?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Too obvious!</p>
<p>Well, how do you want me to look at them?</p>
<p>With your eyes, just look with your eyes.</p>
<p>Be subtle, be small.</p>
<p>My eyes, they slant down.</p>
<p>I don't have a good peripheral.</p>
<p>Okay, can you just be subtle?</p>
<p>It's a good table.</p>
<p>It's a good table.</p>
<p>How'd they get a better table than us?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Dennis, can we just focus on us?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's our monthly dinner, all right?</p>
<p>Don't let them ruin it.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I have some issues that I want to talk to you...</p>
<p>Aw, shit. Really?</p>
<p>No, I... Look, let's-let's keep things light; I don't want to get all heavy.</p>
<p>Let's not let tonight become more unpleasant than it's already become, okay?</p>
<p>I mean, already I'm irritated.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm already sitting in the wobbliest chair in the entire restaurant.</p>
<p>All right, well, we'll just ask the waiter for a book of matches.</p>
<p>I don't want to sit on a pile of matches.</p>
<p>Look, I'll just scoot back.</p>
<p>It's fine. It's fine.</p>
<p>Oh, but now I feel like... you're sitting so far away from me.</p>
<p>It's gonna be fine!</p>
<p>This is a perfectly suitable distance for us to have our monthly dinner.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>I am so sorry.</p>
<p>Are you?!</p>
<p>His chair's wobbly.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Let me get you a book of matches to put under there.</p>
<p>I don't want to sit on a pile of matches.</p>
<p>Dennis, it's not like your chair's gonna catch on fire.</p>
<p>Oh, Christ, I'm not worried about my chair catching on fire.</p>
<p>Look, sir, can you just get us a better table in general?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>We're fully booked tonight due to a Groupon deal.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds excellent.</p>
<p>We'll have one of those.</p>
<p>No, we won't.</p>
<p>We don't need a coupon.</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm disappointed in you people.</p>
<p>This is Gugino's.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be the nicest restaurant in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Here I am, a regular, a full-paying customer, and I'm sat by the kitchen on the wobbliest chair in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>You know, forced to eat dinner with this swarm of coupon-waving trash.</p>
<p>This is crazy!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Forget it, doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Get me a pile of matches to sit on-- that'll be fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>There's more.</p>
<p>There's an old, short, fat man here.</p>
<p>He's sat with his young sleeping partner.</p>
<p>Bring them a glass of the house red from us.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Although the table did just order cocktails, so maybe...</p>
<p>I don't need their entire life story.</p>
<p>Just go get the wine.</p>
<p>Well, that was a nice gesture.</p>
<p>Was it?</p>

<p>No, I don't need this shit.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.</p>
<p>I-I'm gonna go ahead and order when I'm goddamn good and ready to order.</p>

<p>I don't think it's the chair.</p>
<p>You don't think it's the chair?</p>
<p>Well, maybe my old pal, uh, Abraham Lincoln begs to differ.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, yeah, uh... You can just hand it to me.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Your waiter.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Can you get him a new chair?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Oh, oh!</p>
<p>Maybe this George Washington will make it come here faster.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This wine is for you.</p>
<p>Ah, management sent us a bottle to accommodate us.</p>
<p>Actually, it was your friends over at the other table.</p>
<p>And they wanted me to relay to you that it's our most expensive bottle.</p>
<p>They said to say that.</p>
<p>That's a classy move.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stand up and bow.</p>
<p>No. Do not stand and bow.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>We've got to do something in return.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>We'll send it back.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>We'll say, we don't want that.</p>
<p>You know? We'll-we'll tell them that, uh, what is it, Chilean wine is out of season, and that their taste in wine in general is very poor.</p>
<p>No, that's... we got to be more subtle than that.</p>

<p>Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>Uh, that's a dig.</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Take the chair, but I tell you what, when you're over there?</p>
<p>Tie his shoelaces together.</p>
<p>(giggles)</p>
<p>You want me to... tie a customer's shoelaces together?</p>
<p>Uh... Look, I'm in the biz, guy.</p>
<p>I'm a waitress, okay?</p>
<p>Look, let's team up and stick it to that guy.</p>
<p>It'll be hilarious.</p>
<p>I would lose my job.</p>
<p>Uh... (fake sobbing)</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I-I would lose my job.</p>
<p>And I wouldn't be able to work at Gugino's anymore, and my family, and they'd be so disappointed 'cause they're currently so proud of my accomplishments."</p>

<p>I'm gonna take the chair.</p>
<p>Fine, take the goddamn chair.</p>

<p>How's the new chair?</p>
<p>Oh, it's terrible, Mac.</p>
<p>Thank you for asking.</p>
<p>It might be worse than the first one.</p>
<p>I mean, I cannot find a single flat spot in this entire restaurant.</p>

<p>I am enjoying myself.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying our table.</p>
<p>I'm trying to start the conversations.</p>
<p>I wore two colognes.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm very aware of how much cologne you're wearing, Mac.</p>
<p>It's overwhelming me.</p>
<p>I mean, every time the goddamn kitchen door opens, it wafts into my face.</p>
<p>Hey, I like the way I smell.</p>
<p>And I like me.</p>
<p>And I haven't even gotten to talk about what I wanted to talk about, which is an issue that has been weighing on me, so I'm just gonna say it, okay?</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>When I wanted to get the karaoke machine for our apartment, you laughed in my face.</p>
<p>That's what this is about?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The karaoke machine?</p>
<p>Mac, you can't sing.</p>
<p>It's not about singing!</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>It's about you always putting me down, and... you know what?</p>
<p>I don't care; it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Where you going?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go sit with Frank and Charlie.</p>

<p>On that fine summer eve, when I did that double jackknife twist and blew everybody's tits off?</p>
<p>You remember that?</p>
<p>And then I went down on Chrissie Orlando on the trampoline later that night?</p>
<p>You're just complimenting yourself.</p>
<p>No, listen, I'm going somewhere with this.</p>
<p>The only reason I was even able to attempt that amazing feat of courage was... because I knew if I failed, you would... (glass clinking)</p>

<p>All the patrons of Gugino's, listen up.</p>
<p>Hi, everybody.</p>
<p>Frank Reynolds, Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>We would like to make a toast.</p>
<p>Now, in front of you, you each see, you have a glass of sambuca?</p>
<p>You see this white, beautiful drink?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, everyone got it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dude, everybody has sambuca but us.</p>
<p>Now we have an American hero tonight, so quick round of applause for our troop here.</p>
<p>(applause)</p>
<p>Nice-looking fellow.</p>
<p>And to anyone who does not have a glass of sambuca... Look around now.</p>
<p>You'll see them.</p>
<p>Those people refuse to drink.</p>
<p>Yeah. They don't know how to pay tribute.</p>
<p>They hate America!</p>
<p>They hate the troops.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>They hate the people who work hardest for them.</p>
<p>They turn them into janitors.</p>
<p>Mm, mm.</p>

<p>To America!</p>
<p>Good job, fellas.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>This is unbelievable, Mac.</p>
<p>You know, and they totally ruined our heartfelt moment.</p>
<p>Now, there's a way we can get it back-- if you just kind of jump...</p>
<p>No, you fool!</p>
<p>That time has passed.</p>
<p>Can't you see they're humiliating us?</p>
<p>Just tell me what you were gonna tell me.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna stand for this.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>Just, Dennis... Come on, man!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Ma'am?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Please return to your table?</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm gonna sit next to the hero.</p>
<p>I used to date a troop.</p>
<p>He was crazy for jean shorts.</p>
<p>Attention, uh, attention, everyone, please.</p>
<p>If I could have your attention momentarily. Thank you.</p>

<p>We do have an American hero in the house tonight.</p>
<p>A strong man, a brave man.</p>
<p>He's the kind of man who knows exactly who he is.</p>
<p>He doesn't hide under a toupee.</p>
<p>He faces his challenges, instead of just retreating to the sewers... nude to forage for rings and coins.</p>
<p>Or to the toilets.</p>
<p>Or to a life filled with rats.</p>
<p>He's the kind of man who gives me the courage to do an amazing double jackknife twist, which I did.</p>
<p>Most of you people wouldn't even attempt that.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>And to go down on Chrissy Orlando on the trampoline later, on the very same night, which I also did.</p>
<p>And I licked her asshole a little bit.</p>
<p>It was pretty good.</p>
<p>It was all right.</p>
<p>It wasn't great.</p>
<p>But it was fine.</p>
<p>And I knew that it was gonna be fine because this guy would be here to catch me if I faltered.</p>
<p>Yeah. The world is a safer place when he's around.</p>

<p>Air is blowing directly on us. What...?</p>
<p>I mean, what is happening?</p>
<p>Those goddamn sons of bitches.</p>
<p>They turned up the A/C.</p>
<p>Because they knew we were sitting right underneath a vent.</p>
<p>And they're trying to freeze us out.</p>
<p>I didn't have your back before, but now I'm gonna be the wind beneath your wings.</p>
<p>I'm gonna smash this over their goddamn heads.</p>
<p>Yes, Mac. Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>I'm gonna blast 'em with this fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll toss hot soup in their faces.</p>
<p>I'll pinch their dicks with this lobster.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>What are you people doing?</p>
<p>Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p>What are you people doing?</p>
<p>(crowd gasps and murmurs)</p>
<p>Son a bitch!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Hey, his shoelaces are tied together.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Somebody tied his shoelaces together.</p>
<p>His shoes are tied.</p>
<p>Spaghetti-O, the waiter.</p>
<p>I've wanted to see that all night long.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Oh, my God, who do we have to thank for this?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Deandra did it?</p>
<p>Oh! Dee did it! It was Dee.</p>
<p>Dee.</p>
<p>Have you been here this entire time?</p>
<p>Yeah, the whole time.</p>
<p>Oh, great job, Dee.</p>
<p>Great job.</p>
<p>Oh, Dee.</p>
<p>Hey, clash. Salud, huh?</p>
<p>Salud.</p>
<p>Guys? Guys, I'm really hurt.</p>
<p>Back at the table!</p>
<p>I want to hear some jokes out of you tonight.</p>
<p>You want to try this coat on?</p>
<p>It's gotta look good on you, dude.</p>
<p>Put that hat on.</p>
