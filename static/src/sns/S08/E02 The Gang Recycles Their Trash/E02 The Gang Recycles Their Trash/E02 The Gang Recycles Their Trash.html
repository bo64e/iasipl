<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: I cannot believe how bad it's gotten back here.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: We should have gone in the front.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: The front's worse.</p>
<p>Oh, God, it stinks so bad!</p>
<p>I can't believe the trashmen can strike in this economy. It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>It should be against the law.</p>
<p>Is all of this our trash?</p>
<p>We generate a ton of it.</p>
<p>It's a sad throwaway culture we're living in.</p>
<p>Mm, it's true.</p>
<p>I feel like you guys have done something like that before?</p>
<p>Have we?</p>
<p>Shut up, bird.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>It's just not that funny.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, look out.</p>
<p>Ooh! Whoa!</p>
<p>What are you doing, keeping trash in here?!</p>
<p>Take it outside.</p>
<p>There's no more room outside.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Can you believe these trash bozos?</p>
<p>They make $20 an hour and they want more?</p>
<p>20 bucks an hour?</p>
<p>That's an outrage!</p>
<p>These guys are blasting us in the ass.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we pay their salaries, and they turn around and ass-blast us? Come on.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You don't pay taxes.</p>
<p>You don't even vote.</p>
<p>Who am I supposed to vote for, the Republican who's blasting me in the ass or the Democrat who's blasting me in the ass?</p>
<p>Yeah, politics is all one big ass-blast.</p>
<p>This doesn't all sound familiar to you guys?</p>
<p>If these jerks don't want to do their job, I say we do it for 'em.</p>
<p>The trash business is a <em>gold</em> mine.</p>
<p>Yeah, Frank's right.</p>
<p>Let's pull up our bootstraps, oil up a couple asses and do a little plowing of our own.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>Not gay sex.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>It seemed like... What are you talking about?</p>
<p>We're gonna solve the trash crisis.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>All of this, I've heard all of this before. No?</p>
<p>Shut up, bird.</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>All right, it's a simple plan.</p>
<p>Matt, Dennis, Charlie, you rent the van, you drive to rich people's homes, you tell them that you'll pick up the trash for a fee.</p>
<p>Then you take the trash to a dump in New Jersey where there's no strike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I dress Dee up like a whore, get a city official, bribe him, and make him give us the contract, undermining the trash unions.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>We've gone to door-to-door in a van before, and that didn't work out for us.</p>
<p>This is gonna work, trust me.</p>
<p>Mac?</p>
<p>I think it's gonna be hard to hang off the back of a van like the trash guys do.</p>
<p>Can we just get a trash truck?</p>
<p>No, you don't want to be caught scabbing.</p>
<p>Get a van. Dennis?</p>
<p>I don't want to be a trashman.</p>
<p>I'll bribe the city official with you.</p>
<p>I need a lady whore. Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah, I've done the whore thing before.</p>
<p>I don't care for it.</p>
<p>I won't be doing it again.</p>
<p>The whore thing worked.</p>
<p>You just didn't listen to me.</p>
<p>How many times have we done this kind of thing before?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>We've done things.</p>
<p>We've done stuff like this all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, once or twice.</p>
<p>And how often do they work out?</p>
<p>Well, come on.</p>
<p>It doesn't always work out.</p>
<p>How often <em>should</em> it work out?</p>
<p>Almost never.</p>
<p>That's because you don't listen to me.</p>
<p>This time we do it <em>my</em> way.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm a little confused.</p>
<p>So, Frank is the brains and you're just the looks now?</p>
<p>And I'm still the wild card, so that's good.</p>
<p>No, no, guys, we're forsaking the group dynamic, okay?</p>
<p>And truthfully, Charlie, come on.</p>
<p>I mean, (sighs) nobody wants a wild card, okay?</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>We don't want a maniac in our group.</p>
<p>There's no benefit to it.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Uh, I feel like you just agreed with me, but you weren't listening to what I was saying.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You pointed at me like I said something, but I didn't.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>Charlie, having somebody making wild decisions that make no sense, that benefits nobody.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Right, yes.</p>
<p>Is he listening to us?</p>
<p>I can't tell.</p>
<p>He's listening.</p>
<p>He's not understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah, he doesn't even like, get us, man.</p>
<p>It's... We're talking about you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, let's move on from it.</p>
<p>What do you think is happening right now?</p>
<p>Guys, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>We'll sort this out later.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, guys, because I have no love for this plan.</p>
<p>I just don't want to be a trashman.</p>
<p>Yeah, and guys, if I'm being honest, there's no way that I can hang off one of the back of these, just simply no way.</p>
<p>Yeah, what would you hang onto?</p>
<p>Let's bail on plan.</p>
<p>Let's bail on it.</p>
<p>I don't want to do it.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, but that's the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>We can't just quit.</p>
<p>Like, we have to see Frank's plan all the way through.</p>
<p>That's what he wants us to do.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, fine.</p>
<p>We'll do Frank's plan.</p>
<p>But I think I have a tweak that is gonna solve both of our problems.</p>
<p>This is what I'm talking about, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>See, we're still doing Frank's plan; we're just improving on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we... absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, the man's got good plans.</p>
<p>It's the specifics are outdated.</p>
<p>They're old... You know?</p>
<p>They're very outdated.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, in the 1950s, yeah, you could drive around door to door in a windowless van, and people didn't think they were gonna get raped.</p>
<p>Now, th-they will think that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is better.</p>
<p>I know, and plus with the tuxedos, you know, honestly, who wouldn't want their trashman in a tuxedo?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I know I would.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room in the back for the trash.</p>
<p>You know, the real trashmen don't know we're scabbing.</p>
<p>Good plan.</p>
<p>It's a good plan.</p>
<p>Wonder how Max is doing back there.</p>
<p>I can't believe you never listen to me.</p>
<p>You're supposed to look like a whore.</p>
<p>The whore-politician is outdated, Frank.</p>
<p>That is an idea that's best left in the trash.</p>
<p>I am presenting myself as a powerful lady.</p>
<p>You're presenting yourself as a banana.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, I'm here and I'm doing your plan.</p>
<p>I'm just doing it my way.</p>
<p>Well, at least sex it up a little bit.</p>
<p>Open some buttons.</p>
<p>I don't want to. Stop it.</p>
<p>Get off me!</p>
<p>Show some skin.</p>
<p>Stop it, Frank!</p>
<p>St... Oh, great!</p>
<p>This is nice. This doesn't look powerful or sexy.</p>
<p>Now it looks good.</p>
<p>Great job, Frank!</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>I'm running a little bit late.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that you guys wanted to get a bid to undermine the waste manag... I know you guys.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>This ain't gonna work.</p>
<p>You know this guy?</p>
<p>It's the gay guy who wanted to buy Paddy's.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you fired me from the Oldies Rock Café.</p>
<p>Huh, I did not picture this guy getting recycled back into the mix.</p>
<p>So much for the sex appeal angle.</p>
<p>I don't know, Frank, why don't you sex it up a little?</p>
<p>What do you mean? Get off.</p>
<p>Get off of me, get off of me.</p>
<p>Why don't you sex it?</p>
<p>How about you be the whore?</p>
<p>How about you be the whore, huh?</p>
<p>Get off me.</p>
<p>Why don't you show some skin?</p>
<p>Please... Stop it.</p>
<p>Get off of me.</p>
<p>Huh? He likes it like that.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Oh, do it, show some skin.</p>
<p>Knock it off, you lousy bitch.</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Uh... you like what you see?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>♪ I still got the moves... ♪</p>
<p>(humming)</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, guys, we've done something like this before, so we should be able to do it better this time around.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, right off the bat, Charlie, were you planning on doing an accent of any kind?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>You guys were both planning on doing accents.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Let's not do accents. That's the kind of wild-card stuff that always gets us into trouble.</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>Let's put all of our cards on the table.</p>
<p>Were you guys planning anything else?</p>
<p>I have a knife.</p>
<p>Why do you have a knife?</p>
<p>Uh, to make sure that the plan works.</p>
<p>Could be good.</p>
<p>Okay. The plan's gonna work.</p>
<p>Give me the knife.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Should I have the knife?</p>
<p>I should have the knife.</p>
<p>Somebody should... have the knife.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that if I don't have the knife, then one of you will stab somebody.</p>
<p>And again, that's a wild card thing; we don't want that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's what we're trying to get rid of, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We <em>don't</em> want that.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, right...</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So why don't... and also, why don't you guys let me do the talking?</p>
<p>Well, hold... hang on.</p>
<p>You know, 'cause now you're... look, you've done talking before, and that hasn't always worked.</p>
<p>It hasn't worked because you guys are always interrupting me.</p>
<p>We were always what?</p>
<p>I'll talk!</p>
<p>I'll talk.</p>
<p>Mac, you have an exceptional number of bugs in your teeth.</p>
<p>You're gonna want to rinse those out; it's disgusting.</p>
<p>Bugs?</p>
<p>Yes, bugs.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Is that what that is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you're going to ride back there, ride with your mouth shut, man.</p>

<p>No thank you. Just the trash.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn't sharp.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it, boys.</p>
<p>So how does this place tickle your fancy?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Because you are a power bottom.</p>
<p>He's a what?</p>
<p>A power bottom.</p>
<p>I'm not having this conversation.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>We can pick up the trash for half the price of the union.</p>
<p>We want city contract.</p>
<p>Look, there's no way you're going to undermine one of the biggest unions in the city.</p>
<p>Moreover, both sides are incredibly close to an agreement. So...</p>
<p>Well, you see anything you like here?</p>
<p>Maybe we can hook it up and change your mind.</p>
<p>May I please leave?</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>We take you to a titty bar and you say no to us.</p>
<p>We bring you to this place with all these juicy dongs, and you shut us down.</p>
<p>What team are you playing for?</p>
<p>Hold on a second, Frank.</p>
<p>I think I know what's going on here.</p>
<p>This man has been realigned.</p>
<p>He's a yestergay.</p>
<p>What's a yestergay?</p>
<p>A lot of men bounce around from label to label never quite finding their proper gay home.</p>
<p>My hunch is that this gentleman has gone from a twink to a twunk to a twank.</p>
<p>What's a twunk?</p>
<p>Twink and a hunk.</p>
<p>A twink with muscles, but still hairless.</p>
<p>So smooth.</p>
<p>Oh, incredibly smooth.</p>
<p>A twank on the other hand.</p>
<p>Twank is no good.</p>
<p>That's a twink and a skank.</p>
<p>Essentially a ragdoll, just being passed around from twink to twunk to bear to otter.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>What's an otter?</p>
<p>Subsection of bear.</p>
<p>Still hairy, but where a bear generates his power through sheer mass alone, the otter generates his power through extraordinary quickness, cunning, and skill.</p>
<p>That is a lot to keep in your head to maintain a lifestyle.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to maintain the lifestyle of a twank versatile 'cause this this often leads to a lot of self-hatred and denial, especially among the religious or political types.</p>
<p>So they try and realign their sexual orientation through therapy.</p>
<p>So he's not gay anymore?</p>
<p>Well, that's a hotly debated topic, isn't it?</p>
<p>I, for one, am of the belief that some things can't be thrown in the trash, Frank.</p>
<p>And your sexuality is one of them.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Some cocks can't be unsucked.</p>
<p>So is it a case of forgetting, or is it denying?</p>
<p>Neither.</p>
<p>Still gay.</p>
<p>You still here?</p>
<p>I thought you'd be gone by now.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>You're pointing a gun at me.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot.</p>
<p>(uncocks gun)</p>
<p>Well, I guess we'll be the ones to slink away.</p>
<p>Dee...</p>
<p>(all laugh)</p>
<p>Whoo! All right.</p>
<p>Are you guys having fun?</p>
<p>Yeah! This is my dream.</p>
<p>Are you guys loving this or what?</p>
<p>Great, because I'm not.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not loving it.</p>
<p>You know, I used to love trash, but this is just not how I wanted this to go.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Look, yes, we're making lots of money, and that's great, but our tuxes are ruined and our limousine is covered in trash and seagulls.</p>
<p>(gull caws)</p>
<p>The gulls are shitting all over me.</p>
<p>Oh, look, we've essentially become garbagemen.</p>
<p>That's what I was trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Guys, can I make a suggestion?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>I don't want to do Frank's plan anymore, so I say we just quit right now.</p>
<p>Let's quit it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I still have a lot of energy... Me too.</p>
<p>...and I would like to take one of our old plans out of the trash and recycle it.</p>
<p>You want to sell gas door-to-door?</p>
<p>I've been thinking it the entire time.</p>
<p>That's what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I've totally been thinking about that.</p>
<p>See, 'cause we're like...</p>
<p>Ya, ta, ta, ta ta!</p>
<p>Our friendship is like... It's strong.</p>
<p>We'd never blow that up.</p>
<p>That can't be trashed.</p>
<p>Never throw that out.</p>
<p>Guys, that gas idea was a great idea, and it was trashed long before it should've been trashed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have one more suggestion.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Instead of taking that all the way to New Jersey... let's just dump it in a poor neighborhood because they don't mind living in their own filth.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They don't know any better.</p>
<p>I mean, why else would they choose to live like that?</p>

<p>Look, the point is, we got to learn from our mistakes, right?</p>
<p>You know, make a couple adjustments.</p>
<p>Let's solve this trash crisis.</p>
<p>(tires screeching)</p>
<p>Okay, when we arrive, Dennis will do all of the talking, Frank and I will handle the refuse, and Dee will take the wheel.</p>
<p>Then we can strap me onto the back for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Everybody's happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, I can't believe it, but I think this might actually work.</p>
<p>See, all we had to do was learn from our mistakes and then work together.</p>
<p>Everyone got to contribute something to the group as a whole.</p>
<p>What did you contribute?</p>
<p>Try the brakes.</p>
<p>Try the... Did you cut the brakes again?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie.</p>
<p>Why would you do that, Charlie?</p>
<p>That's just what I do.</p>
<p>Wild card, bitches!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yee-ha!</p>
<p>(Dennis and Sweet Dee screaming)</p>
<p>Oh, my... We have no brakes.</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>What are you doing, what...?</p>
<p>That's that.</p>
<p>Whew, good call of getting those brakes fixed, Mac.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that coming a mile away.</p>
<p>All right, now that we got rid of our wild card, we can actually see this thing through.</p>
<p>So, we good?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, this is gonna be easy money.</p>
<p>Grab some trash, you bitches.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>I'm telling you, this is gonna be great.</p>
<p>I feel like this is gonna work, I think.</p>
<p>(vehicle approaches, horn honks)</p>
<p>Guess the strike's over.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>So, the rugs?</p>
<p>Yeah, the rugs.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the rugs.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's always been the rugs.</p>
<p>Rugs are a great idea.</p>
<p>Of course it's rugs.</p>
<p>It's always been the rugs.</p>
<p>We should get a billboard.</p>
