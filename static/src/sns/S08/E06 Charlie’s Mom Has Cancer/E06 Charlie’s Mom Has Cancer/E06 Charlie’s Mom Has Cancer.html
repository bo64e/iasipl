<p>(knocking)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hey, knock, knock.</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie</strong>: Oh, hi, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hey, Ma.</p>
<p>Listen, you're doing me a solid offering to do this laundry, all right?</p>
<p>Well, we never get to talk.</p>
<p>That's why I offered.</p>
<p>We don't talk, and it's good that way.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>Hey, Mac's here.</p>
<p>He brought his laundry.</p>
<p>Thanks a bundle, Mrs. Kelly.</p>
<p>I got Frank's stuff, Dee's stuff, Dennis' stuff, so you're gonna be working.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, well, what I wanted to talk to you about...</p>
<p>Ooh, talky, talky, talky, talky, talky.</p>
<p>You know, Mom, we're busy.</p>
<p>We got a whole big day planned.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got to go back to Paddy's and polish off a couple beers, so it's like...</p>
<p>Beers, you know, but hey.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>We'll come back when it's folded and good and done.</p>
<p>I'd like to bring it up now.</p>
<p>Um, I have cancer.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I got to... I'm sorry. What?</p>
<p>I have lung cancer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>You don't even smoke.</p>
<p>Well, you know, it's just one of those freak things.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: And then Psychic John said that he could tell I was under a tremendous amount of stress and that my heart was filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>Now how would he have known that if he wasn't psychic?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I'm not giving you any money for your dumb psychic.</p>
<p>But he says I'm gonna have a tremendous windfall of cash.</p>
<p>You're losing your mind.</p>
<p>You're being scammed.</p>
<p>I'm losing my mind?</p>
<p>How many pairs of shoes have you lost this month, Frank?</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Four. That's not the point.</p>
<p>The point is my mind is as sharp as a... what do you call it?</p>
<p>Um, it's a... Knife?</p>
<p>No, uh, what you put... What you... What you...</p>
<p>I just don't understand why it's my fault.</p>
<p>It's your fault because your mom is directly responsible.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we both decided to move them in together, so you know, you deserve half the blame.</p>
<p>You want to put half the blame on me?</p>
<p>Guys, my mom has lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>You know, geez.</p>
<p>That's-that's terrible.</p>
<p>What the hell was that, dude?</p>
<p>That didn't sound very genuine.</p>
<p>No. Sorry.</p>
<p>What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p>What are you... Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Are you screwing with me right now?</p>
<p>No, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I think the cancer thing, for whatever reason, is just not...</p>
<p>You know, it's just not grabbing me right now.</p>
<p>Not grabbing you?</p>
<p>My mom is dying!</p>
<p>Okay, calm down, calm down.</p>
<p>Okay, because my mom has a doctor that can cure the cancer for 4,200 bucks, so no big deal.</p>
<p>4,200 bucks? To cure cancer?</p>
<p>That's it?</p>
<p>No, I mean, that's a scam.</p>
<p>That's what I was saying.</p>
<p>Do you think it's a scam?</p>
<p>Come on, people take advantage of old people and scam them all the time.</p>
<p>Thumbtack.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Thumbtack.</p>
<p>We were talking about things that earlier that were sharp, and a thumbtack is sharp.</p>
<p>Thumbtack?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. You see what I'm talking about?</p>
<p>People get old and then their brains turn to mush, and then people come along and take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Now, Frank, give me the hundred bucks you were excited to give me for my psychic.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where the hell are we?</p>
<p>I mean, your mom's totally screwing my mom again with this doctor scam.</p>
<p>No, it's not a scam, Charlie.</p>
<p>She's been seeing this guy for years, and she doesn't have cancer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got to say, though, this is a strange place for a doctor's office.</p>
<p>What's this guy's name?</p>
<p>Dr. Jinx.</p>
<p>Dr. Jinx is the name of a monkey, not a man.</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>He lives in a garage?</p>
<p>Yeah. Guys, look, let's just give him a shot, all right?</p>
<p>If we don't like what we see, we reassess.</p>
<p>All right. Go.</p>
<p>(music playing)</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you Dr. Jinx?</p>
<p>Indeed I am.</p>
<p>Have a seat.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>So, what are we gonna do, guys?</p>
<p>I'd just like to say this is, uh, this is weird.</p>
<p>Now, I can understand your suspicions.</p>
<p>Now, when most people think of a doctor, they don't think of a black man living in a garage surrounded by houseplants.</p>
<p>I normally think Asian.</p>
<p>Yeah, or I think of an Indian guy.</p>
<p>Or white.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern. Pretty much anything other than black.</p>
<p>Is that racist?</p>
<p>Hell, yeah, it's racist.</p>
<p>Your parents ain't let you watch <em>The Cosby Show</em> when you was coming up?</p>
<p>Oh, my parents would never have let me watch something like that.</p>
<p>Let's not make this about racism.</p>
<p>Let's make this about the man who's living in a garage treating my mom for cancer.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, now, look, here's my deal: I use ancient homeopathic remedies derived from the Mother Earth.</p>
<p>You can't get no cleaner than that.</p>
<p>Homeopathic from Mother Earth, huh?</p>
<p>Dr. Jinx, I have an eczema situation that's burning me up good.</p>
<p>Do you have anything for that?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Well, that's not eczema.</p>
<p>What you have there, my friend, that's sailor's rot.</p>
<p>Sailor's rot?</p>
<p>I'm not a sailor, Dr. Jinx.</p>
<p>When was the last time you've been to Haiti?</p>
<p>Never. I've never been to...</p>
<p>I've been to Kensington.</p>
<p>When you was in Kensington, did you have intercourse with any hoes, ladies of the nights, or prostitutes?</p>
<p>No. No. I have... Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Doctor-client privilege.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I got what you need, okay?</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Oh, that burns!</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Mother Earth don't play.</p>
<p>Do you have anything from the Mother Earth that would be sprayed on me and cause me to have feelings again 'cause I'm having trouble feeling things.</p>
<p>Oh, you want feelings?</p>
<p>Oh, I have something for that.</p>
<p>Dr. Jinx got something for feelings.</p>
<p>(plays funky bass line)</p>
<p>Okay, so that was a scam, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I think he sprayed me with Miracle-Gro.</p>
<p>All right, guys, my mom has real problems.</p>
<p>I need real help.</p>
<p>Oh, I got it.</p>
<p>I know exactly who we need to turn to next.</p>
<p>♪ Raise you up on eagles' wings Bear you on the breath of dawn ♪<br />

<p>Lord God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>What are we doing here?</p>
<p>We're turning to the big man upstairs.</p>
<p>He's gonna make this right.</p>
<p>I can't believe you think this is a real solution to our problem.</p>
<p>Dennis, what do you think of all this?</p>
<p>Shh. Amen.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to embrace this.</p>
<p>I want to see if I can knock some emotion loose.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, don't say that; now kneel.</p>
<p>Why do I have to kneel?</p>
<p>I don't see the point.</p>
<p>Because God wants it.</p>
<p>Look, just do what the priest says; don't ask why, just do.</p>
<p>Look, our moms are here.</p>
<p>They see the value in it.</p>
<p>Why can't you?</p>
<p>(coughs)</p>
<p>Where's your mom going?</p>
<p>Oh, she keeps a cigarette burning out on the steps outside, so she's gonna go hack a butt.</p>
<p>So, she just comes and goes as she pleases?</p>
<p>There's no sort of rules for her?</p>
<p>She's put her time in here, all right?</p>
<p>The Lord makes an exception for her.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, man.</p>
<p>Hey... stop using his name in vain; now, stand.</p>
<p>(groans) Stand?</p>
<p>Yes, and give me some money for the baskets.</p>
<p>No, I'm not giving you money.</p>
<p>We have to give money...</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Look, maybe the church should give us money, you know?</p>
<p>They seem to have plenty of it.</p>
<p>Dude, the church doesn't give money; it takes it, all right?</p>
<p>That's the way it works.</p>
<p>And then you go to heaven.</p>
<p>Now, kneel.</p>
<p>Kneel? I got to kneel again?</p>
<p>Actually, it's over.</p>
<p>We're standing again.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>This is a scam, okay?</p>
<p>This is a scam.</p>
<p>It's kneeling, standing, getting people all confused.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, come here.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Offering you a sign of peace.</p>
<p>I don't want this.</p>

<p>Can I say something?</p>
<p>Sorry about your mother.</p>
<p>(Charlie groans)</p>
<p>Okay, I want to talk about someone in your life.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, someone close to you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm getting a Fa... No, I'm getting a Ba...</p>
<p>No, I'm getting a Da... Dennis?</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, no, I'm seeing that.</p>
<p>Dennis?</p>
<p>Yup, yup, I'm seeing Dennis.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I am feeling as if he is a neighbor... or an enemy.</p>
<p>He's a coworker, friend, he's a relative...</p>
<p>He's my brother.</p>
<p>He's your brother.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is he how I'm getting my windfall of cash?</p>
<p>You know, I'm not seeing clearly yet how you get the cash.</p>
<p>I do see a lot of money in your future.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah, but... (laughing): Oh, shit.</p>
<p>I think it's gonna take a few sessions to really get the whole picture.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Ha-- I was just out buying new shoes and I remembered I didn't want to give you that hundred bucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you called me and you said you changed your mind and you'd like to give me another hundred, so where is it?</p>
<p>I did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, shit.</p>
<p>Hi. Psychic John.</p>
<p>You have an interesting aura.</p>
<p>Don't start with me.</p>
<p>Who's gonna win the Super Bowl this year?</p>
<p>You don't know shit.</p>
<p>Well, I do know that you lost three pairs of shoes this month.</p>
<p>You have a pork chop bone in your left pocket; you have 57 cents in your right, and you clipped someone's side mirror while parking in a handicap spot.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Can you conjure the dead?</p>
<p>Can you get my dead whore wife back here so I can lay into her from the other side?</p>
<p>Well, I can't do that.</p>
<p>Nah, because you're full of shit.</p>
<p>I can't do it because I feel her spirit is still very much alive.</p>
<p>(gong rings)</p>
<p>What? No, well, I don't know about that.</p>
<p>W-W-Wait a minute.</p>
<p>I knew there was always something suspicious about that whore's death.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes, we didn't ask any questions.</p>
<p>We never saw the body.</p>
<p>We didn't go to the funeral.</p>
<p>I am feeling as if she is still living somewhere in the city with a small Mexican dog.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee gasps)</p>
<p>Does that ring a bell?</p>
<p>Ooh, that dirty bitch.</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you, guys.</p>
<p>I didn't feel much in there, but I do always enjoy the little wafers.</p>
<p>Of course you do because you're consuming the actual body of Christ.</p>
<p>Uh-huh, well, he was delicious.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>You're eating our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ every Sunday, that's...</p>
<p>You're telling me that you believe that Christ comes back to life every Sunday in the form of a bowl of crackers, and then you proceed to just eat the man?</p>
<p>Correct, you consumed his corpse and you drank his blood; that's a part of...</p>
<p>Good, good, good, good.</p>
<p>This is what we're dealing with.</p>
<p>Hey, Mom.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p>Why are you here, honestly?</p>
<p>I was praying for help.</p>
<p>I need the money for Dr. Jinx.</p>
<p>Dr. Jinx is a con artist and a lunatic.</p>
<p>I-I know he's strange, but he's a great doctor.</p>
<p>He really does cure people.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, look at this.</p>
<p>My rash is almost completely cleared up.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah, look at that.</p>
<p>Whatever he sprayed on me worked.</p>
<p>He might actually be a good doctor.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Hi, everybody, just a reminder if you wouldn't mind.</p>
<p>We're asking for extra donations for the statue of the Blessed Mother that was vandalized last week.</p>
<p>What the shit, man?</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>My mother is dying of cancer and you need money to fix a statue?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, don't give me this act.</p>
<p>Charlie, calm down.</p>
<p>No, no, no, why don't you give us some money, okay?</p>
<p>How much is that ring worth?</p>
<p>That looks like an expensive ring; can we have the ring?</p>
<p>Okay, uh-uh, I'm sorry, Father, I will pray for his sins.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>It's okay. I got this.</p>
<p>What am I doing?</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>No, listen, listen, listen.</p>
<p>Don't get all riled up about this scam or that scam, you know.</p>
<p>It's all a big scam, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I will say this, the church's scam?</p>
<p>It's a pretty good one.</p>
<p>It's effective.</p>
<p>Look at all the money these people are giving to the church.</p>
<p>So, I say we use that model to raise money for your mom at Paddy's.</p>
<p>Guys, let's throw a beef and beer.</p>
<p>A beef and beer-- it's been years.</p>
<p>Beef and beer, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, we invite the members of this congregation down to Paddy's for cheap beef and watered-down beer.</p>
<p>We'll prey on their Catholic guilt by playing up your mom's cancer and "Oh, she's dying," and she is, you know, and we'll raise a bunch of money to give to your mom to give to Dr.</p>
<p>Jinx.</p>
<p>It's the Holy Trinity: beef and beer and Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Dig, dig, dig.</p>
<p>What makes you think she's got money buried in the dog's grave?</p>
<p>Well, she can't use a bank.</p>
<p>She's probably got money buried all over the city.</p>
<p>Oop, there we go.</p>
<p>Yeah, dig it up, dig it up.</p>
<p>Come on, buddy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Aah, goddamn!</p>
<p>Aw, there's a dead dog in there!</p>
<p>Gross!</p>
<p>That's not a dog.</p>
<p>That's my toupee, my blond toupee.</p>
<p>I used to wear this in Miami.</p>
<p>She hated this goddamn thing.</p>
<p>Oh, she didn't like that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You are an idiot.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, there is some cash.</p>
<p>That dirty whore.</p>
<p>There's got to be, like, five grand in here.</p>
<p>I bet she's probably got this stuff hidden all over the city.</p>
<p>I can't believe this.</p>
<p>She's alive.</p>
<p>We better tell your brother Daryl 'cause he's gonna want to be in the loop.</p>
<p>Dennis?</p>
<p>Dennis, Dennis, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Okay, shh.</p>
<p>Frank, you're losing it!</p>
<p>Stop it. Pipe down.</p>
<p>People live here.</p>
<p>My head is turning to soup.</p>
<p>Okay, I get it.</p>
<p>Hey, uh-uh, Mr... Juarez.</p>
<p>Mr. Juarez, that's right.</p>
<p>You remember the Mexican family whose house we burned down and we had to give them our mansion.</p>
<p>Oh, how do you like the mansion?</p>
<p>Oh, it's been very, very nice.</p>
<p>You know, the weddings, the quinceañeras, but it's very expensive.</p>
<p>Uh, how you call it, uh, property tax.</p>
<p>It's too much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We had to leave.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am back here every Saturday.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Oh, I have to go to work.</p>
<p>Aw, shit.</p>
<p>Well, that sucks.</p>
<p>Tell you what.</p>
<p>Property taxes-- paying for what you already own?</p>

<p>It's not about... whether something is true, or-or based in fact, or reality, or the laws of physics, or nature, or-or even basic common sense.</p>

<p>Just get to the money part.</p>
<p>All right, just get the money part done.</p>
<p>"Give me money.</p>
<p>Money me.</p>
<p>Money now.</p>
<p>Me a money needing a lot now."</p>
<p>That was Charlie's line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Charlie, I-I can't do this.</p>
<p>Doing great.</p>
<p>Doing great.</p>
<p>I have a confession to make to all of you.</p>
<p>Don't do it, bitch!</p>
<p>I don't have cancer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>(murmuring)</p>
<p>We're the ones that broke the Virgin Mary statue.</p>
<p>We accidentally hit it with our car.</p>
<p>Mm... We were trying to raise money to get it fixed.</p>
<p>That's just crazy.</p>
<p>You could've just told me the story about hitting the statue.</p>
<p>I mean, where did you come up with this idea?</p>
<p>Well, I learned everything by watching you.</p>
<p>Well, I... Oh... Aw, shit, I did do that, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, you totally... you pulled that shit on us, too.</p>
<p>Well... You son of a bitch.</p>
<p>That's no excuse.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, at least you didn't try and grift a doctor, though.</p>
<p>No, no, I never actually said I was a doctor.</p>
<p>He is the goddamn church gardener.</p>
<p>A gardener?</p>
<p>I guess that would explain this.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus... I was gonna talk to you about that.</p>
<p>I'm really sorry.</p>
<p>You had my back up against the wall, I had to spray you with a heavy dose of pesticide.</p>
<p>Put some aloe vera gel on there, a little bit of vitamin D... What?</p>
<p>He doesn't know that.</p>
<p>He doesn't know that.</p>
<p>Don't get a diagnosis from him now.</p>
<p>Why... how would you know that?</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Dennis. Dennis!</p>
<p>Mom's alive.</p>
<p>She faked her own death to steal Frank's money, and we think it's buried in her grave.</p>
<p>That dirty whore.</p>
<p>Everybody get a goddamn shovel!</p>
<p>This is such a perfect place for that bitch to hide my money.</p>
<p>Oh, Psychic John talked about this.</p>
<p>He said I was gonna come into a windfall of cash, and it's all in here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then we can use some of that cash to pay for the statue that our moms broke, Charlie.</p>
<p>All right!</p>
<p>(coughing)</p>
<p>You guys ready?</p>
<p>Crack it open, Charlie.</p>
<p>(chanting): Charlie, Charlie...</p>
<p>(chanting): Show me the money, show me the money... (whooping)</p>
<p>Ah, shit!</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Mommy, Mommy!</p>
<p>Ah! I grifted ya!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I paid off the psychic.</p>
<p>I buried the money in the dog grave.</p>
<p>(crying): My mommy, my mommy's a skeleton!</p>
<p>I grifted your asses good because you said I was slipping.</p>
<p>I feel too much!</p>
<p>I feel too much!</p>
<p>(sobbing)</p>
<p>You made me dig up my dead mother because I said you were losing it?</p>
<p>Score one for the old people.</p>
<p>Ha ha!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>What the hell happened to my shoes?</p>
