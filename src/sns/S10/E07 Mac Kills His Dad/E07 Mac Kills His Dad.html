<p>A tragic ferry accident today-- apparently a ferry rammed into the shoreline at full speed near a local power plant there. There are multiple fatalities and injuries reported at this hour.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: That's really depressing, and how do you lose control of a ferry? They're slow as shit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Guy must've been drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hey-yo! Check out my new threads. Picked them up at the airport.</p>
<p>What were you doing at the airport?</p>
<p>I don't know, just farting around. I found this shop full of this stuff.</p>
<p>Look at that!</p>
<p>I got some for everybody.</p>
<p>"Life is happy"?</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Well, it's-it's clothing that supports a positive message.</p>
<p>I mean, you wear it and you celebrate that life is happy, baby.</p>
<p>In other news, a man is in custody for murder of a state witness who was brutally beheaded by an assailant wielding a stop sign.</p>
<p>A man seeking justice is beheaded by a maniac with a stop sign.</p>
<p>You're right, Frank, life is happy.</p>
<p>The suspect in custody is a 59-year-old repeat felon by the name of Luther MacDonald.</p>
<p>Holy shit-- that's my dad!</p>
<p>If convicted, MacDonald could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Can you believe what they're saying about my dad having killed that guy?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, why-why wouldn't I believe that?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>This has got to be bullshit. He's innocent, and I'm not gonna let the State kill him. I'm gonna save my dad's life.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming with me, man.</p>
<p>Well, you're forcing me to.</p>
<p>Yeah, well...</p>
<p>So I'm here.</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>We got to show support for my dad, right?</p>
<p>We got to let him know that we know he didn't do it.</p>
<p>I know, but I believe that he did, so...</p>
<p>Well, are you gonna be cool?</p>
<p>I'll be cool, you know, as long as he doesn't ask us to shove heroin up our ass again, I'll-I'll be cool.</p>
<p>He might and I might do it.</p>
<p>Well, you would enjoy it more than I would.</p>
<p>Uh, here he comes. Oh, here he comes.</p>
<p>Oh, Dad! He looks great, huh? Dad! Da-Dad! Hey! How are you?</p>
<p>It's been so long! Look!</p>
<p>I-I brought a picture of Mom here just to make you feel more at home.</p>
<p>She looks good, right?</p>
<p>And, uh, me-- what about me?</p>
<p>How do I look? Do I look cool?</p>
<p>Give it a rest.</p>
<p>Do I look cool?</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Uh, we-we just wanted to come by and tell you that we believe that there is no way that you did this.</p>
<p>You didn't do it, right, Dad?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Right. I knew it! I knew it! Another innocent man being railroaded by the system! Besides, there's no way that you could've done this. You have a bad shoulder and that's why you could never have a catch with me, remember?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, Charlie and I just want to let you know that we will not rest until you are proven innocent.</p>
<p>Look, I got a lawyer appointed to me.</p>
<p>It'll be fine.</p>
<p>No, uh, uh, sorry, uh, Mr. Mac, uh, you really don't want to put your life in the hands of a public defender. I mean, those guys are absolute clowns. I tell you what-- I'd be interested to take a look at your case, you know, if-if you want a little outside help. I specialize in bird law mostly, but I know my way...</p>
<p>Stay out of this!</p>
<p>Both of you! I do not want you stirring things up! You hear me?</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I-I-I-I hear you, Dad.</p>
<p>Um, one last thing, though. I love you and I...</p>
<p>Oh, I love you! I love you, Dad!</p>
<p>I love you!</p>
<p>He can't hear me because of this...</p>
<p>Uh, he definitely heard you.</p>
<p>And the glass is too thick.</p>
<p>I think there's something... something wrong with that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, all right.</p>
<p>We're now being told the ferry captain was intentionally trying to steer the ferry into the nearby power plant. The captain has tested negative for alcohol and drug.</p>
<p>The guy wasn't even drunk!</p>
<p>This was a sober man purposely steering a ship into a power plant. Oh, God, the world is a very depressing place.</p>
<p>You guys are depressing.</p>
<p>I'm trying to enjoy my cone over here.</p>
<p>Turn that crap off!</p>
<p>(door opens)</p>
<p>Yeah, baby! There they are! The usual suspects!</p>
<p>Pondy! Just the man I want to see! Now, this man loves life!</p>
<p>I'd love to get into some shots.</p>
<p>Line them up, Frankie! Line them up!</p>
<p>Now we got some positive vibes in here.</p>
<p>You are his AA sponsor, right?</p>
<p>Never change, Dee.</p>
<p>I love it! Come on!</p>
<p>Do a shot with me. Come on-- shot, shot, shot!</p>
<p>I will say I feel like a shot might make me feel better.</p>
<p>I think I need to do a shot at this point.</p>
<p>All right, to the brim.</p>
<p>Let's go, Frank, all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're looking pretty dapper there, Bill-- you hittin' it hard, or what?</p>
<p>I'm celebrating today, baby.</p>
<p>What's the special occasion?</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill myself.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna drink myself to death. Yeah, I botched it.</p>
<p>Life, you know? Old B.P. had a good run, though, you know? It's like there's this tiny little soul man in my body driving me around.</p>
<p>That little soul man's ready to power old Bill down and move on to the next party monster.</p>
<p>Aw, come on, you guys own a bar, right? You watch people slowly kill themselves every day, am I right? (laughs, coughs)</p>

<p>Charlie, this is a huge waste of time.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, this is standard procedure.</p>
<p>They do this on every crime show.</p>
<p>You know, the murder police come down to the scene of the crime and they find some blue-collar guy and they talk to him while he's working.</p>
<p>Let's just talk to this guy over here-- he could know something, right?</p>

<p>Are you a cop?</p>
<p>No. But, uh, I do work on the behalf of the accused.</p>
<p>I'm taking care of his interests and whatnot.</p>
<p>This is his son, uh, Ronald.</p>
<p>You're Luther's kid?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's right, bozo. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure he doesn't get the death penalty, all right?</p>

<p>Why don't you tell us what you saw.</p>
<p>I didn't see either of those guys, okay?</p>
<p>There was more than one guy?</p>

<p>Well, then stop giving us trouble, and tell us if there was another guy.</p>

<p>He does.</p>
<p>No. He told me. He said, "I do not love you. You're a punk." He called me too fat to be a slut, and tried to serve me an omelet with cocaine in it.</p>

<p>Hey, Dad, hey, um, so, I-I know you told us to stay out of it, but, but we found out that there was another guy.</p>
<p>Also, we got a stop sign and recreated the murder, and there was no way that you could have swung that.</p>
<p>Actually, I kind of jacked my shoulder up a little bit.</p>
<p>The way that you...</p>
<p>Do you realize what you've done?</p>
<p>No. Yeah. No. I told him, Mr.</p>
<p>Mac.</p>
<p>I said, "Hey, stealing a stop sign-- that's a felony," and as your counsel, I did advise against it.</p>
<p>I'm talking about you going to the crime scene.</p>
<p>Word's out my son is intimidating witnesses.</p>
<p>Now, that makes me look like I'm guilty.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Your dad'd be a good lawyer.</p>
<p>His idea.</p>

<p>Uh... cursive?</p>
<p>Cursive. Everybody can under...</p>
<p>Okay, look it doesn't matter...</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Bill, we want to talk to you.</p>
<p>We got to talk.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys see this?</p>
<p>It was another ferry that ran into the power plant.</p>
<p>Copycat crime.</p>
<p>(Bill laughs)</p>
<p>Hilarious, right?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No. There are black and white areas in life, Bill, and that's a... that's a black area.</p>
<p>Uh, look, turn it off.</p>
<p>We want to focus on the positive in life now, Pondy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, which is why we're all wearing these ill-fitting T-shirts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, we want to show you some reasons why life is worth living.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, Dennis, you're up.</p>
<p>Okay, so, uh, I like a good mani-pedi.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like... I like a good, healthy nail. I love one.</p>
<p>You know, you get your... you get your nail beds clean, you get your cuticles pushed back, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. That's great.</p>
<p>You get your hangnails all trimmed up... by one of those nice ladies over there.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of those are sex workers.</p>
<p>Yeah, the gals at the nail salon there-- yeah, they're prostitutes.</p>
<p>They're trafficked in.</p>
<p>Usually in shipping containers.</p>
<p>I mean, they're, like, crammed in there, you know, like-like sardines, shipped with sardines sometimes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It's ugly, but the point is, those ladies doing your nails probably tugged a guy off right before you.</p>
<p>They ship 'em in in shipping containers?</p>
<p>That's depressing as hell.</p>
<p>Uh, uh...</p>
<p>Goddamn!</p>
<p>All right, Dee?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>You, you're up, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, Bill, you know, for me, uh, really it's just the simple things that I like in my life, like a moonlight walk or a-a cozy, warm nap.</p>
<p>Or a delicious, ripe piece of fruit, you know?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>The, uh, sex workers use fruit during the act.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, well, the citrus masks the taste of a dirty penis.</p>
<p>(sniffles)</p>
<p>In fact, 95% of fruit has usually been in someone's orifice before it even reaches the market.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, I'm done.</p>
<p>He's ruined fruit for me, so I'm done.</p>
<p>You've made fruit depressing.</p>
<p>All right, well, I got this.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, what makes me happy is, like, you know, at night, a ride around town in a limousine, partying, having a good time.</p>
<p>When I'm on my way home, I'll pass a bum.</p>
<p>I take a balloon with some champagne in it, lob it out and bean him.</p>
<p>He only gets a little bit in his mouth.</p>
<p>He doesn't get the whole thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Not even a full sip of it.</p>
<p>And you say, "Hey, how do you like a taste of the good life, you sack of shit?"</p>
<p>(Bill and Frank laugh)</p>
<p>Hey, that's a...</p>
<p>God, that is awful!</p>
<p>That is a horrible thing to do to another human being!</p>
<p>Goddamn you!</p>
<p>Hey, get over here, Frank.</p>
<p>Get over here.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Okay, that's it, I'm done.</p>
<p>All right, this is depressing as shit.</p>
<p>I'm not doing this anymore.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm starting to think that his family was right.</p>
<p>You guys, what if we took out a life insurance policy on the guy?</p>
<p>I mean, if he's gonna do it anyway, we might as well make a little money off of it.</p>
<p>Hmm, that's dark.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>But can you take a life insurance policy out on anybody?</p>
<p>Does it work that way?</p>
<p>Mm, it's a gray area, but I think I got a guy, I could twist his arm, we could get one.</p>
<p>Okay, I say we embrace the gray area of life, okay, because what we're doing is not working.</p>
<p>What, the state can murder somebody without them even wanting to die but a grown man can't kill himself if he wants to?</p>
<p>A man should be able to end his life if he wants...</p>
<p>He's a grown American man.</p>
<p>We're American.</p>
<p>Aw, to hell with him.</p>
<p>We tried. I give up.</p>
<p>Great, Frank.</p>
<p>Glad you're on our side.</p>
<p>You're a terrible sponsor, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so why were you visiting Luther, Mom?</p>
<p>I went to go...</p>
<p>She don't know nothin' about nothin'.</p>
<p>Look, we know there was another guy in on this, all right?</p>
<p>So, come on, anything you can give us.</p>
<p>He was staying here for a few months.</p>
<p>He was here for a few months?</p>
<p>Mom, why wouldn't you tell me that?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Okay, well-well, was he here on the night of the murder?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Mom, don't lie, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, yes.</p>
<p>Quiet, Bonnie.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Mom, if you know something, you got to tell me.</p>
<p>I can't lie to my Charlie.</p>
<p>Good! Tell me everything.</p>
<p>Okay. They were both here.</p>
<p>They were both inside me.</p>
<p>Eduardo was in my mouth, and Luther was in my butt.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, no, don't tell me everything.</p>
<p>What? No! What?!</p>
<p>Damn it, Bonnie.</p>
<p>Eduardo who?</p>
<p>Sanchez.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Tell us more.</p>
<p>Then Luther went in Eduardo's butt for a while.</p>
<p>Tell us less. Tell us less.</p>
<p>Then they both "completed" on each other.</p>
<p>I-I was left out of the finale.</p>
<p>And then Eduardo went out and then he killed somebody and then... th... Well, that's all I know.</p>
<p>Jesus goddamn Christ, Mom.</p>
<p>If you know that, just say that.</p>
<p>Don't tell me the whole thing about banging every single guy that comes in the house.</p>
<p>If you just know about-about the murder, just say the murder part!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, this is crazy.</p>
<p>You guys know what this means?</p>
<p>That my father was trying to establish dominance, and that's the only reason he was in his butt or...</p>
<p>What are you tal... Why are you focused on that?</p>
<p>Well, it's about power.</p>
<p>We have our guy now.</p>
<p>I feel like we should make that known, that it's about power, okay?</p>
<p>Let's not make any of it known.</p>
<p>We got to go to the police.</p>
<p>Don't be a rat.</p>
<p>All right, look, Mrs. Mac, we're not gonna rat, all right?</p>
<p>We're gonna figure something else out.</p>
<p>Good?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Okay, you're off words again.</p>
<p>Great. Uh, and, Mom, don't bang every guy that comes into the house.</p>
<p>How 'bout that?</p>
<p>Okay, I won't, sweetie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It is my gift to you.</p>
<p>This is... this is great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, we've had a major break in my dad's case.</p>
<p>What's Ponderosa doing here?</p>
<p>Oh, he's, uh, gonna drink himself to death, so we took out a life insurance policy on him.</p>
<p>Oh, cool, yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty dark, though, right?</p>
<p>We've been over this.</p>
<p>We've justified this already.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>We're okay with it.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Uh, turns out that Mac's dad didn't kill the guy.</p>
<p>No, there was another man in on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's gonna look really bad if I rat on this man Eduardo Sanchez, so I can't say his name.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>You just did.</p>
<p>You just ratted him out.</p>
<p>You said his name.</p>
<p>By the way, another guy being there doesn't mean that your dad didn't do it.</p>
<p>He might've done it with the other guy.</p>
<p>Oh, no, uh, my dad established dominance over this man.</p>
<p>All right, well, let's not...</p>
<p>Oh, what-what does that mean?</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Uh, there's some weird prison sex going on.</p>
<p>He may or may not have been a power bottom.</p>
<p>The bottom line is he talked his lover into doing the murder for him.</p>
<p>Not his lover, his prison bitch.</p>
<p>Hey, what if I confess? Hmm?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I could take my own life while saving your dad's.</p>
<p>Everybody wins.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, except everyone would think that you decapitated a man with a stop sign.</p>
<p>Ooh, even better.</p>
<p>Oh, that'll really embarrass the wife.</p>
<p>Okay, I like where this is going, but I got to bring something up here.</p>
<p>Um, if you were to do that-- and I don't want to be crass or, you know-- but how would that affect, uh, the...</p>
<p>Oh, we still get the money.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I bought the most expensive policy I could.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Let's go confess, baby!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can't... I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I just... I don't get how it's dominant if they finished on each other.</p>
<p>How is that dominant?</p>
<p>It's dominant because he finished first.</p>
<p>Then he allowed Eduardo to finish.</p>
<p>No, you're making that up.</p>
<p>You don't know that.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, there's Bill.</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Well, I did it. I confessed.</p>
<p>Why aren't you in handcuffs then?</p>
<p>Weirdest thing, I'm sitting in the interrogation room, you know, sobering up a little bit, looking at myself in the two-way mirror and I kept reading this shirt.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I started thinking, "You know what, life<em> is</em> happy.</p>
<p>I want to live!"</p>
<p>Well, then what did you confess about?</p>
<p>Eduardo Sanchez.</p>
<p>That guy you were talking about?</p>
<p>Turns out he's some big gang member that they've been after for years.</p>
<p>Yeah, your dad's innocent.</p>
<p>Holy shit, my dad's gonna get off.</p>
<p>That means I'm a hero!</p>
<p>I did it!</p>
<p>Dad, Dad, we did it.</p>
<p>We did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we did it!</p>
<p>They're gonna nail this Eduardo Sanchez guy and you're gonna walk free.</p>
<p>I saved you.</p>
<p>Saved me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You buried me.</p>
<p>Now everyone in here thinks I'm a rat.</p>
<p>They're gonna kill me in here.</p>
<p>Because of you.</p>
<p>I'm-I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I still love you.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>(door buzzes)</p>
<p>He definitely heard you.</p>
<p>You know, he can... he can hear you.</p>
<p>He didn't mean that, though.</p>
<p>He was just upset.</p>
