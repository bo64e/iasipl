<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, man, this is so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Is this the green room?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>A game show.</p>
<p>Can you guys believe we're gonna be on a game show?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right, all right, relax.</p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>Guys, the green room of <em>Family Fight...</em></p>
<p>I've got goose bumps.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, calm down. Don't start acting like an animal, here. All right, listen, this is <em>Family Fight.</em> This is a nationally televised program. This is a very big deal for us, okay? We're talking...</p>
<p>What are you doing? Are you stealing an ashtray right now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why? We have ashtrays, and you don't even smoke.</p>
<p>This is a perfect place for me to lay out my political agenda.</p>
<p>No, no, no. No politics, man.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Because it's too polarizing, okay?</p>
<p>And don't be misogynistic and please don't be gross, I mean...</p>
<p>Guys, let's-let's be smart about this.</p>
<p>Let's be right down the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Right down the middle sounds so boring. That's not what the audience wants to see. Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny McCarthy thing, where I'm, like, super sexy, but I got a potty mouth.</p>
<p>Ah-ah, no, no, Dee, you are never going to be sexy. And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay? We don't want to come across as low-brow animals. Now, have some veggie platter and have some fruit, okay? That is brain food.</p>
<p>Mm-mm, no way, not me. Haven't eaten in three days.</p>
<p>I don't want to be puffy. J-Mac's face... it's never puffy.</p>
<p>Yeah, because J-Mac's face is stapled to the back of her head.</p>
<p>Now, eat some food. You look emaciated and sick.</p>
<p>(passing gas)</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Fart noise key chain.</p>
<p>Dennis, what is this enticing bowl of white?</p>
<p>This?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Charlie, that... that's cottage cheese.</p>
<p><em>Cottage</em> cheese?</p>
<p>Like... cheese from some cottage? Whose cottage?</p>
<p>Well, like, what is that, exactly?</p>
<p>How do you not know what it is?</p>
<p>Aren't you, like, a cheese guy?</p>
<p>I'm not a cottage guy.</p>
<p>You are gonna make us lose this game.</p>
<p>(audience cheering faintly)</p>
<p>Here comes the other family.</p>
<p><strong>Janet</strong>: Hello. You must be the Reynolds family. I'm Janet, and we're the the Barretts.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay...</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Hey, guys! I'm Lisa. I'm stage manager.</p>
<p>Both teams ready?</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Let's play <em>Family Fight!</em></p>
<p>It's time to play <em>Family Fight!</em></p>
<p>Let's give it up for your host, Grant Anderson!</p>
<p>(Grant laughing)</p>
<p>How you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>Grant</strong>: Hey, oh!</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>All right! Thank you for coming out, everybody, and welcome to <em>Family Fight.</em></p>
<p>I'm your host, Grant Anderson. Today, we have the Barrett family... (applause) ...versus the Reynolds family! (cheering)</p>
<p>And they are here for a whole lot of cash, so let's get it on!</p>
<p>Give me Janet, give me Frank.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Oh... whoa.</p>
<p>Whoa, I didn't get a good look at you before backstage.</p>
<p>(Janet laughs)</p>
<p>Sha-booyah-roko.</p>
<p>(whoops)</p>
<p>Okay, all right, we got some-some sparks flying already here. (laughs)</p>
<p>Now, let's get up here and do this.</p>
<p>Come on, Frank, you ready?</p>
<p>I'm ready.</p>
<p>All right, man. Top four answers on the board, here: Name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us.</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Pig!</p>
<p>Show me pig!</p>
<p>(cheering, applause)</p>
<p>OK Frank, do a little dance.</p>
<p>Now Frank, you want to pass or play? Pass or play?</p>
<p>Oh, we... we'll play. Play, play, play.</p>
<p>We're gonna play.</p>
<p>(whoops)</p>
<p>You want to talk a little bit about the family?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, yeah, you know, uh, Grant?</p>
<p>Yes, Grant.</p>
<p>I want to... I want to change my answer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Wh... what? Why?</p>
<p>I have realized it's-it's not totally accurate, because I've seen a pig eat a man.</p>
<p>In fact, I've seen many pigs eat many men.</p>
<p>It was a bloodbath.</p>
<p>Well, okay, well, we can't do that. I'm gonna move on, though, 'cause you're losing me here.</p>
<p>(laughing): Yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, Grant... a lighthearted barb, if you will.</p>
<p>So, uh, so...</p>
<p>His talk of pigs and man flesh is confusing as it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Don't you just want to...</p>
<p>I hear you, I hear you, Dennis.</p>
<p>You know, you have these people in your life and you just want to...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, uh, why don't you tell me something?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I am the proprietor of, uh, one of the most charming pubs in all of South Philadelphia.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>Paddy's Pub!</p>
<p>Paddy's... Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but listen, I am so much more, Grant.</p>
<p>Um, I'm kind of a jack of all trades, if you will.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the question really isn't "What do I do?" It's "What don't I do?"</p>
<p>Wow. Now, there's a lot of confidence right there. I like that.</p>
<p>I like that, Dennis. All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy, can you name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us?</p>
<p>Oh, easy. A sea urchin.</p>
<p>A sea... a what now?</p>
<p>Sea urchin.</p>
<p>Sea urchin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Show me sea urchin!</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Ooh, one strike.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>One strike for the Reynolds here.</p>
<p>Wow, that, uh, that buzzer sounds... it's awfully loud.</p>
<p>It is loud.</p>
<p>Pierces you right down to your soul, doesn't it?</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I'll be fine, though.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>All right, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who do we have here?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hello... Deandra.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah. Deandra, help me out-- name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us.</p>
<p>Well, Grant, I'll tell you what...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>...I like to eat cock.</p>
<p>(audience exclaims)</p>
<p>Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, we can't say... Lisa, are we gonna...?</p>
<p>See what I did there? It's a little bit of a double entendre type of thing. I was talking about chicken, but I said "cock."</p>
<p>Yeah, don't say that word.</p>
<p>Please, I'm-I'm... Just, it's a family show, so we're just gonna go with "chicken," okay?</p>
<p>Show me chicken!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>An answer on the board!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ronald Reynolds.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hello, sir.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>How you doing today?</p>
<p>I'm great, Grant.</p>
<p>I'm just really excited to be here with my new family.</p>
<p>Oh... your new family?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, a little bit of background.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, actually, just for clarification. Um, he raised them, but he didn't sire them. Now, he may have sired him-- we're not exactly sure, but they do live together in squalor.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I actually brought my blood bucket in case you guys want to run his blood and see if it all checks out. It'd be good to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, if we want to do, like, a quick DNA sequencing...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...at the commercial break, that actually would clear things up for everybody.</p>
<p>If we could.</p>
<p>It would set the record straight. But either way, I was always the odd man out, you know? I mean, you know.</p>
<p>And then Frank, here, adopted me and now I'm a part of the Reynolds family!</p>
<p>Okay, well...</p>
<p>We don't... I'm... I'm just... I'm not even gonna try to figure that one out, so...</p>
<p>Okay, here-here's the deal, guys: from now on, I'm not gonna ask you guys any more questions at all...</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>...other than the ones that keep the game moving. All right?</p>
<p>Great! Yeah!</p>
<p>Great! (whoops) Show me... cow!</p>
<p>Nope, that's me. I say that word.</p>
<p>I say the "show me" part. You just give me the answer.</p>
<p>Okay, Ronald?</p>
<p>Right, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Show me c...</p>
<p>Don't say "show me."</p>
<p>He just said that.</p>
<p>Don't say it.</p>
<p>He just said that.</p>
<p>Just say the answer.</p>
<p>Show... show me.. is the part I say?</p>
<p>Here's the one thing... there's only one thing in the whole world at this moment you shouldn't say...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh...</p>
<p>You know what, go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>Just go ahead and do it, then.</p>
<p>Do what?</p>
<p>Mother of... Show me cow!</p>
<p>Cow!</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>Good answer!</p>
<p>So, sadly we got to stay here. Okay. Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Just need you to name an animal...</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>...that we eat but doesn't eat us.</p>
<p>Doesn't eat us-- that's easy. Dragon!</p>
<p>Charlie, do you eat dragon?</p>
<p>No! I don't eat dragon 'cause, uh, it's-it's not a meal for peasants, it's a meal for kings, and I'm sort of a common man.</p>
<p>But they don't eat us; they, uh, it's like a misconception.</p>
<p>They actually eat gold and treasure.</p>
<p>That's why they're always sitting on a big pile of it.</p>
<p>Bad answer.</p>
<p>Bad answer.</p>
<p>Bad answer.</p>
<p>That's a bad answer.</p>
<p>Okay, show me dragon!</p>
<p>(Charlie laughing)</p>
<p>I told you!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(Grant laughs)</p>
<p>Well, astonishingly, uh, one person surveyed gave the answer dragon, so... What a world!</p>
<p>All right, the Reynolds family has won round one!</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>There you go, all right.</p>
<p>Sha-booyah!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sha-booyah!</p>
<p>But we got a lot more show to go! It could be anybody's game. We'll be right back after this with<em> Family Fight!</em></p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>That's commercial, guys! Back in three.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, uh, that was terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, we're bombing out there. This-this is exactly what I was trying to avoid, guys.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>We won that round.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you were being lascivious and disgusting. Dee was making sex jokes that were going over like a lead balloon.</p>
<p>Well, at least we got all of our answers right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that-that's utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>I mean, how is dragon an answer and sea urchin isn't?</p>
<p>Everyone knows...</p>
<p>I don't know, but there's always a weirdo or two in those panels who's gonna give a stupid answer and Charlie's always gonna get those, right? So...</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll get the steal.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Plus, people don't even really eat sea urchin, Dennis.</p>
<p>Most people don't eat dragons.</p>
<p>Well, dragonflies.</p>
<p>People don't eat dragonflies.</p>
<p>(Charlie imitates buzzer)</p>
<p>Don't make that noise.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>Just relax, would you, Dennis? Look, if we make asses out of ourselves, they just won't air the episode, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, you don't know that and secondly, don't tell me to relax.</p>
<p>(Mac imitates buzzer)</p>
<p>All right, don't you start making that noise.</p>
<p>(Frank imitates buzzer)</p>
<p>All right, it's not funny when they do it, it's definitely not funny when...</p>
<p>(Dee imitates buzzer)</p>
<p>(Dennis yelling)</p>
<p>(all imitating buzzer)</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>(all cheering)</p>
<p>All right, welcome back to <em>Family Fight.</em> We got the Reynolds family over here with a hundred points. We got the Barretts over here with zero. Give me Bobby, give me Dennis!</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>All right, all right. Somebody got a little, a little lead in his shoes.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>No. No, my shoes are fine. I assure you.</p>
<p>They're made of the finest Italian leather.</p>
<p>The fit is perfect. Therefore, there would be no room for lead.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The top four answers are on the board.</p>
<p>We asked a hundred people on the street, "Name something people groom themselves with." Dennis!</p>
<p>Laser beams, Grant.</p>
<p>La-laser beams?</p>
<p>Yeah, laser beam. It's the only way to completely obliterate the follicle.</p>
<p>Show me laser beam!</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That noise, it's too loud. Can we, can we just turn it down a touch?</p>
<p>We cannot, we cannot.</p>
<p>Bobby, you got an answer?</p>
<p>I got an answer.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hair brush!</p>
<p>Show me hair brush!</p>
<p>(dings)</p>
<p>There it is, there it is.</p>
<p>Hair brush, that's so obvious. God, that buzzer noise!</p>
<p>Isn't that just irritating as hell?</p>
<p>Come on, we got to think of a steal here, okay?</p>
<p>I got one, I got one! What about, uh, uh, bleaching cream for your facial hair?</p>
<p>What the hell?!</p>
<p>No, no. I-I got it. Drakkar Noir.</p>
<p>Mm, too specific.</p>
<p>You know what it is?</p>
<p>I think it's a bride. A bride could be a good answer.</p>
<p>(dings)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You can't become a groom or get groomed without a bride.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no...</p>
<p>Right, right. That's not the kind of grooming they're talking about.</p>
<p>I don't know. Charlie could be right.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I... I got dragon.</p>
<p>No, he's not, he's not right!</p>
<p>Because nobody else is that stupid.</p>
<p>Show me pumice stone!</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>All right, here we go. Reynolds family for the steal!</p>
<p>No, no, we're not gonna say that.</p>
<p>The comb, a comb!</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with... toe knife.</p>
<p>With what now?</p>
<p>With a toe knife 'cause I-I use a-a sharp blade to dig the scum out of my toenails. Once in a while, I cut myself, but it puses up and in three days, it's good as new.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Toe knife!</p>
<p>Way more information than we needed, but, uh... show me toe knife.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Okay, the Barretts win the board!</p>
<p>There you go! All right! Okay, let's see-see what that last answer was.</p>
<p>(dings)</p>
<p>Bride!</p>
<p>Charlie was right.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Do you, do you groom a bride, Lisa? All right, hey, let's get onto that last round now! I need some Dee, I need a little bit of Lester! Come on now! Okay.</p>
<p>Come on, Dee!</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go-- top six answers are on the board.</p>
<p>Name something that people are afraid of.</p>
<p>(all gasping)</p>
<p>Oh, oopsie-daisy! Looks like I, I broke it.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Can't believe that's... Ain't never seen anything like that in my life. What do you got, hands made of anvils?</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>You want me to answer that or answer...?</p>
<p>I don't want you to answer either of them, okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Because I don't know who won because you broke the machine.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Right? Okay?</p>
<p>It makes sense, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, we're gonna take a couple seconds.</p>
<p>We'll be right back after this.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh!</p>
<p>Start thinking of a steal because if we get this one, we win the game.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>What's the question?</p>
<p>Things people are afraid of.</p>
<p>That's still the question?</p>
<p>Yeah... How do you not know how the game works by now?</p>
<p>Okay, I'm afraid of game show rules.</p>
<p>You guys, I know what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>It's failure.</p>
<p>That's too pathetic.</p>
<p>Liberal yahoos taking my guns.</p>
<p>That-that is a political firestorm, Frank. No!</p>
<p>Oh, oh! The Nightman.</p>
<p>All right, guys, these are terrible answers, all right?</p>
<p>Now, normally I would've said the crust on a crème brûlée burning the top of your mouth, but I'm thinking like a commoner now and I really do think that the right answer is probably... clowns.</p>
<p>That's a good answer.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I feel like it could be Nightman.</p>
<p>No, I feel like it isn't the Nightman...</p>
<p>He could be right, dude.</p>
<p>I've got a lot...</p>
<p>Show me dogs!</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>(Barretts groan)</p>
<p>God (bleep)! Okay, Reynolds, you get a chance to steal and win the whole game right here.</p>
<p>Name something that people are afraid of.</p>
<p>(Frank clears throat) We're gonna go with...</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, Frank. You have to say it in the form of a question.</p>
<p>What is...?</p>
<p>No, you don't, you don't... you don't have to do that 'cause it's not<em> Jeopardy.</em></p>
<p>Ah, it's not<em> Jeopardy.</em></p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Say "show me," Frank.</p>
<p>Don't say "show me," Frank. Just say the word.</p>
<p>Just say the word.</p>
<p>Show me clowns!</p>
<p>All right. Show me clowns!</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>We did it! We did it!</p>
<p>And the Reynolds win the game!</p>
<p>The Reynolds win the game!</p>
<p>(chanting): Sha-booyah, sha-booyah, sha-booyah, you lose!</p>
<p>Sha-booyah, sha-booyah, sha-booyah, you lose!</p>
<p>All right, okay. So, anyway... (chuckles) let's take a look at the last one, everybody.</p>
<p>"Nightman." Don't know what that is.</p>
<p>Just don't know what it is.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Pretty strange answers today!</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>All right, man. Uh, we're gonna come right back and play some Fast Money. We'll see you right after these messages.</p>
<p>(cheering, applause)</p>
<p>How the hell was "Nightman" an answer?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Dude, I think I'm remembering what happened. I took this survey.</p>
<p>I got interviewed at a mall and I thought it was, like, a government thing.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>That's actually the only thing that makes sense.</p>
<p>Right? Okay. So I should play Fast Money, because I'm gonna know all the answers.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you're only gonna know <em>your</em> answers.</p>
<p>And that's only gonna get us one point for every question.</p>
<p>We need to get all the top answers to win Fast Money.</p>
<p>Right, totally, totally. And then we spin the wheel.</p>
<p>Okay, you're definitely not gonna play, 'cause you can't understand a thing that's happening.</p>
<p>I'll play.</p>
<p>No, you won't play, because you've been nothing but gross and foul and polarizing the entire time. You're embarrassing me in front of the whole nation. Dee...</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>...you and I are gonna play.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Can I do my fart keychain?</p>
<p>Absolutely goddamn not.</p>
<p>Okay, now go get something to eat, you look terrible.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm very hungry, but I'm not gonna blow it now. This is my close-up.</p>
<p>(sighs) God, don't be a dumb, hungry bitch the entire time.</p>
<p>Guys, we're back.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Okay, all right, you're going first, Dee, you're going first.</p>
<p>Okay, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>(applause, cheering)</p>
<p>All right, we are back with Fast Money, here with Dee Reynolds. But first, there's somebody who wants to say something to you.</p>
<p><strong>Cricket</strong>: Hey, Reynolds family! Win $20,000 and bring home the money for Paddy's Pub!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Yeah, all right. I'm done dancing like a monkey.</p>
<p>Give me my five bucks, Chuck.</p>
<p>(audience exclaiming)</p>
<p>Ha ha, wow! That was a rough video, right there. That dude is hard on the eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah. He's all burned up.</p>
<p>We couldn't get anybody else?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, you ready, Dee?</p>
<p>Oh, you better believe it.</p>
<p>But, uh...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm?</p>
<p>...first, hold on a... hold on a second, there's, um...</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>There's, uh...</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>Ooh! Yeah.</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>Uh, yes... there's a... just a quick bit I wanted to, uh... Oof.</p>
<p>(audience exclaims)</p>
<p>(farting noises)</p>
<p>Oh, whoops-a-daisy. (laughs)</p>
<p>(farting noises continue)</p>
<p>That's about as lowbrow as it gets.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dennis isn't gonna like that.</p>
<p>It's pretty funny, though.</p>
<p>Okay, new plan.</p>
<p>(audience cheering)</p>
<p>All right. So we're back here with, uh, Fast Money here. Uh, now we got Frank doing it, 'cause... people just be faintin' up in here, so...</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Give me 30 seconds on the clock.</p>
<p>Name something you thought existed when you were a child.</p>
<p>Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Name something you might find in a bathtub.</p>
<p>Soap!</p>
<p>Name something people add sugar to.</p>
<p>Coffee.</p>
<p>A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>Little moustache.</p>
<p>Name a foreign country whose films are popular in America.</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>(cheering)</p>
<p>Damn! You did it, man!</p>
<p>I'm surprised, too, brother!</p>
<p>Oh, oh, that was so good!</p>
<p>That was so good, Frank!</p>
<p>Hey, you ready?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm ready.</p>
<p>Frank did great.</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, Dee passed out.</p>
<p>She... of course she did.</p>
<p>She's so embarrassing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right, here we go, everybody.</p>
<p>We're gonna bring Dennis out right now.</p>
<p>Here he is, Dennis Reynolds.</p>
<p>(cheering, applause)</p>
<p>Okay. Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis... Frank got the number one answer for every single question, so you only need five points to win the game. Okay?</p>
<p>Okay, I can do it. Now, Grant, listen, I know I gave some bad answers before...</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>...but I understand the game perfectly now, and, uh, that does not represent me.</p>
<p>Okay, I like that.</p>
<p>Okay? So I'm ready to give good answers.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>That does represent me.</p>
<p>All right, that sounds good, that sounds good.</p>
<p>If you repeat any of Frank's answers, you're gonna hear this sound... (buzzer blares) ...and then...</p>
<p>Thought we were done with the buzzer.</p>
<p>Only if you repeat an answer.</p>
<p>Even in this round?</p>
<p>Yes, even in this round. Yep.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>If you don't know an answer, you can say "pass" and we'll just move on to the next question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, are you ready?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Let's put 30 seconds on the clock.</p>
<p>Name something you thought existed when you were a child.</p>
<p>Santa Claus.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Oh, God... uh, pass.</p>
<p>Name something you might find in a bathtub.</p>
<p>S... uh, soap.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Ah! God, I really hate that buzzer. Can we not do that?</p>
<p>Clock's ticking, clock's ticking.</p>
<p>Okay, uh, pass.</p>
<p>Name something people add sugar to.</p>
<p>God... coffee.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Oh, God...</p>
<p>Nope, we gotta... we need an answer.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, okay, no, then pass, then pass, 'cause...</p>
<p>A thing you associate with Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>Mmm... pass.</p>
<p>Okay, name a foreign country whose films are popular in America.</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>Oh, God, no, no!</p>
<p>Already said that.</p>
<p>Oh, God, France.</p>
<p>(buzzer blares)</p>
<p>France. France. France.</p>
<p>That's still not the answer.</p>
<p>Little moustache. Soap, soap, France.</p>
<p>There was something else.</p>
<p>Stop it already!</p>
<p>Don't say France!</p>
<p>(Dennis sobbing)</p>
<p>All right, I have never seen a more embarrassing display in my entire career.</p>
<p>Oh, please don't air this. Okay? Please don't... don't air this... you won't air this, right?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, we definitely air it.</p>
<p>We always air it. No matter what, we air it.</p>
<p>That's how we do it, my friend.</p>
<p>It just went so wrong...</p>
<p>Good night, everybody! Thanks for joining us here on <em>Family Fight!</em> Take care.</p>
<p>(audience applauding, cheering)</p>
<p>(Dennis sobbing)</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Why'd they have to air that part?</p>
<p>That was the end part.</p>
<p>The best part.</p>
<p>Yeah, they air the whole show.</p>
<p>(Dennis sobbing)</p>
<p>This doesn't represent me, though.</p>
<p>This doesn't represent me. That's not who I am.</p>
<p>So just don't air it. It's the buzzer that was...</p>
<p>That just doesn't represent me. So just don't air it!</p>
