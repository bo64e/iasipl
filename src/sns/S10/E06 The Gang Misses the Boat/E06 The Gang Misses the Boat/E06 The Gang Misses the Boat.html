<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Turn this up. This is my jam right here.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, yeah... Oh, shit! Did I just miss the turn?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, yeah, dude. I think it was back there.</p>
<p>Aw, man! You better hurry up. We're gonna miss that boat!</p>
<p>Well, don't blame me. It took Dee a goddamn hour to get dressed like a man.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Nah. Captain Barnacle.</p>
<p>It's a great new character I'm working on. Argh!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Give me another worm, Charlie.</p>
<p>All right, coming up. You want rum or julep?</p>
<p>That's a rum one...</p>
<p>I'll take the rum one.</p>
<p>You guys brought worms in here?</p>
<p>Well, we kind of soaked them in alcohol and you suck the alcohol off of them.</p>
<p>Ah! I ate mine.</p>
<p>You're gonna ruin this!</p>
<p>How often do boat parties come around and with hot mainline women? This is a classy event. It took me hours to get us invited to this. Oh-oh! There's the boat.</p>
<p>(Dennis groans)</p>
<p>Goddamn it! We missed it. Aw!</p>
<p>This is great! This is exactly what I was worried about!</p>
<p>Great, guys. Way to go.</p>
<p>You know what? Screw it.</p>
<p>I'm going in.</p>
<p>What-what are you talking talking about?</p>
<p>We're going in.</p>
<p>Not in the water?</p>
<p>Yes, we're going in the wa...</p>
<p>Look, guys, this car was built for this, okay?</p>
<p>It's got air intake valves.</p>
<p>This is precision British land- to-sea craftsmanship at work.</p>
<p>We're going in.</p>
<p>We're not missing that boat.</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>What have we become?</p>
<p>I mean, we have literally and figuratively missed the boat.</p>
<p>I used to be a cool guy, right?</p>
<p>With a cool car hanging out all the time.</p>
<p>And now I'm a... what am I?</p>
<p>I'm a chauffeur to a bunch of worm-sucking idiots!</p>
<p>You? What about me?</p>
<p>I used to be a party boy who banged chicks all the time.</p>
<p>You guys remember?</p>
<p>But no one was ever good enough for you, dude.</p>
<p>So, I got self-conscious and I stopped-- because of you, I changed who I am at my core!</p>
<p>Mac, Mac, that is not what happened, okay?</p>
<p>You are completely delusional.</p>
<p>I mean, and by the way, all of us have become so goddamn weird.</p>
<p>I think we're just hitting our stride.</p>
<p>Oh, you think we're "hitting our stride," Frank, really?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>'Cause Dee's in a goddamn costume every other day.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we all are.</p>
<p>I think we have more costumes in the bar than we do kegs.</p>
<p>I mean, what, what if I said I wanted to become a man cheetah right now, what would you do?</p>
<p>I'd go get the spots.</p>
<p>He's got spots!</p>
<p>Why do you have spots?</p>
<p>You shouldn't have spots.</p>
<p>That's absurd, man.</p>
<p>That's absurd. You know what?</p>
<p>I actually, I blame you for most of this.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Yeah, because you came in here with your endless goddamn supply of money and financed all this bizarre behavior!</p>
<p>You were plenty weird before me.</p>
<p>What about the underage drinking scheme?</p>
<p>I wasn't even here for that.</p>
<p>But that made sense, Frank.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>You know what? I got to get away from you people.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>I-I-I-I fly off the handle every five seconds now.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I got to get away from you people-- you're all insane.</p>
<p>I'm storming out!</p>
<p>What? Don't copy me!</p>
<p>I'm the one who's angry.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>You don't storm out on me.</p>
<p>I storm out on you.</p>
<p>I'm the one who storms out!</p>
<p>I'm the one who... Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no. Okay.</p>
<p>You know what? Yeah.</p>
<p>That's fine. Storm out.</p>
<p>Get angry.</p>
<p>You guys be that guy 'cause I'm not gonna be that guy anymore.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna get angry and shit.</p>
<p>I'm gonna cool off.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go back to being what I was before.</p>
<p>A cool guy who just hangs out and has a cool car.</p>
<p>So, I'm not gonna storm out, but I am gonna leave.</p>
<p>I'm gonna... leave casually.</p>
<p>You want to get lunch?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>When was the last time, like, just you and me went out to eat?</p>
<p>It's been a while, right?</p>
<p>By ourselves?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't even know.</p>
<p>It's nice to go to a diner, too, you know?</p>
<p>Like, I like diners.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I appreciate a menu with pictures.</p>
<p>It makes it easier.</p>
<p>It's like sometimes those guys make me do things that aren't really me, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, okay, like, I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now and throw my glass of water in your face.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p>
<p>You know what I was about to do?</p>
<p>Pretend that I had to go to the bathroom and then I was gonna sneak out the window and just get out of here 'cause I was afraid you were gonna do that to me first.</p>
<p>Oh, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Isn't that weird?</p>
<p>I was, though.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. But again, I think it was... 'cause, like, that's what the guys would've done and...</p>
<p>It's the peer pressure thing from those guys.</p>
<p>Right. Okay. Well, forget the the guys today, right?</p>
<p>They're not here. So, um...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>Uh, let's see.</p>
<p>I'd like to order my food in a German accent.</p>
<p>Right, right. Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I guess that's just... I put all these expectations on myself to be funny all the time.</p>
<p>You know? Because that's what people have come to expect from me.</p>
<p>But that's not fair.</p>
<p>It's too much pressure for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>No, I don't think anyone expects that at all.</p>
<p>Wait, what about you?</p>
<p>What do you want to do?</p>
<p>Okay, uh, well, I would like to get a chicken sandwich, but, uh, but I think I want to get the beak on the side?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Frank's always making me eat it first and frankly I'd rather it last if I'm gonna have to eat it all...</p>
<p>Ooh, I can help you here.</p>
<p>Instead of eating it last, you don't have to eat beak at all.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Ready to order?</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(German accent):<em> Ja,</em> vell, uh, I vould like ze...</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I would like a chicken sandwich, please.</p>
<p>Okay. And you?</p>
<p>Beak!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Regular chicken sandwich.</p>
<p>That's it?</p>
<p>That's it for him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>You did it! You did it.</p>
<p>God, I really wanted to say it!</p>
<p>I saw that you wanted to say it badly.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right, well, this is good.</p>
<p>This is great. This...</p>
<p>I'm very proud of you.</p>
<p>This is very good. All right.</p>
<p>Look at us! Cheers!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No beak.</p>
<p>Bob, I want to thank you for answering my ad so quickly.</p>
<p>Well, I really needed a car and I always wanted a Range Rover.</p>
<p>Yeah, well...</p>
<p>Hey, I got to tell you, though.</p>
<p>This is not just a car.</p>
<p>This is a lifestyle.</p>
<p>This is an Eddie Bauer edition.</p>
<p>Tortoise-shell interior, super-charged twin cam, European luxury sports utility vehicle, my friend.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Yeah! It's a classic, okay?</p>
<p>The only reason I'm giving her up is 'cause I'm ready to turn a page.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about getting an Alfa Romeo, what do you think?</p>
<p>Two seats-- me and a babe.</p>
<p>You like babes, Bob?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, sure!</p>
<p>Yeah! Who doesn't like babes?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. It's a wonderful machine.</p>
<p>I used it to traverse the plains the Serengeti of my life.</p>
<p>Now, I want that for you, Bob.</p>
<p>There she is.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you talking about the car in the river?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, it's an amphibious exploring vehicle, so...</p>
<p>You-you think you can pull it out of the river?</p>
<p>No, no! What fun would that be, right?</p>
<p>That's not my job.</p>
<p>That's your job.</p>
<p>I don't want to take that from you.</p>
<p>You're gonna love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, but I just, I didn't bring a change of clothes or anything.</p>
<p>That's really not my fault, is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got to say, uh, your line of questioning's starting to, it's starting to annoy me.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I just, you know, I thought I was gonna see a car on land.</p>
<p>You being cute right now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is that what's happening?</p>
<p>I'm not being cute.</p>
<p>And no sale! How about that?</p>
<p>'Cause you don't deserve the car.</p>
<p>The car has spoken, I have spoken.</p>
<p>You obviously don't get what's happening here.</p>
<p>So, be gone with you!</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There's that anger coming up again.</p>
<p>I'm getting weird and arch.</p>
<p>But that's the gang's fault.</p>
<p>That-that's not me.</p>
<p>I'm fine, see? I'm...</p>
<p>I'm calm, man.</p>
<p>I'm cool as a cucumber.</p>
<p>It's all good. It's all good.</p>
<p>Talking to myself, but that's just 'cause I, you know, I've got shit to say, you know?</p>

<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Oh, hello.</p>
<p>I just parted ways with my old crew, and I'm looking for a new one.</p>
<p>I'm a financier... of fun things like schemes and pranks and such.</p>
<p>You got anything?</p>
<p>You interested?</p>

<p>Mac and Dennis aren't here.</p>
<p>They're not gonna ridicule us.</p>
<p>We get to just pick whatever we want to do.</p>
<p>Well, you know I like making music.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I like listening to it, but it hasn't really ever gotten us anywhere in the past, so, well, what about poetry?</p>
<p>I like poetry, but only if it's def.</p>
<p>Def Poetry.</p>
<p>Yeah, like Def Poetry slams.</p>
<p>Those are awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>What happened to that?</p>
<p>I don't know. Did people just stop thinking they were cool?</p>
<p>That's crazy. Black people don't do stuff that's not cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, so...</p>
<p>He doesn't deserve the car, and that's the plain and simple of it.</p>
<p>Are you crying?</p>
<p>No, I wasn't...</p>
<p>It's humid outside, all right?</p>
<p>That-that's why they're moist...</p>
<p>I don't have to explain myself to a worm-sucking idiot.</p>
<p>Dee, where's the computer?</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna try and control your rage.</p>
<p>This is irritation, okay?</p>
<p>There's a difference.</p>
<p>And why are you irritated?</p>
<p>I'm irritated because I'm having trouble finding a proper buyer for the Range Rover.</p>
<p>I need to create a new ad to attract an appropriate buyer, all right?</p>
<p>Not some asshole who's got a problem with the car being in a river.</p>
<p>It's awesome that the car is in a river.</p>
<p>I need someone who can see that.</p>
<p>Arrogance, vanity-- all over.</p>
<p>He's underwater, like a Range Rover.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, what is this?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Def Poetry.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>Makeup... smearin'.</p>
<p>No power steerin'.</p>
<p>He be talkin', but we don't be hearin'.</p>
<p>I command you to stop.</p>
<p>Speaks like Zeus.</p>

<p>Rage all over from his head down to his shoes.</p>
<p>Zeus, poops and shoes?</p>
<p>Guys, you suck at Def Poetry.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Announcement-- I have an announcement to make, all right?</p>
<p>Thank you for gathering for me.</p>
<p>I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and it's totally sweet.</p>
<p>You guys probably want me to burn it, but I won't, all right?</p>
<p>Now, I like this choice.</p>
<p>I like the choices I've made.</p>
<p>I like who I am, all right?</p>
<p>But I realize I've been lying to myself over the past few years.</p>
<p>And I'm done lying, okay?</p>
<p>And I found someone who's gonna allow me to be me.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Oh, good, all right, yeah.</p>
<p>Great. Finally. Yes.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>That all makes sense.</p>
<p>Let's get this over with.</p>
<p>We're ready.</p>
<p>Let's talk about this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yes! Guys, I'd like you to meet the love of my life, Dusty.</p>
<p>Come on in, Dusty.</p>
<p>Why did I have to wait in the hall?</p>
<p>Oh, I was doing a thing for my friends.</p>
<p>No, no, no, Dusty's a man.</p>
<p>Where is Dusty?</p>
<p>No, Dusty is a... woman.</p>
<p>Why would you think...?</p>
<p>Oh, because of the name.</p>
<p>No, no, she's called Dusty because she's really into angel dust.</p>
<p>I am super into angel dust.</p>
<p>Does she have a dick?</p>
<p>Why would you think she has a dick?</p>
<p>Come on, what-what was that whole speech about, then?</p>
<p>Oh, well, the last few years, I've been settling for fives, you know, and I've been giving you the tens, okay?</p>
<p>But then I realized, you know what, I can be a ten guy, too.</p>
<p>I saw a ten, I went after a ten, and I got a ten.</p>
<p>Let's go, Dusty.</p>
<p>We don't need these turkeys.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go slam ass.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go bang this chick.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>Anger... bubbling like a pot.</p>
<p>Gettin' hot.</p>
<p>Gonna explode like a bomb in a toad.</p>
<p>You mark my words.</p>
<p>If you decide to get into Def Poetry, you are going to fail and bomb and gag and fail and bomb.</p>
<p>It's... that's just... you know, but I don't care, man.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want, man.</p>
<p>I-I'm a cool guy now, so... I'm gonna grab this laptop, I'm gonna go make a new ad for my awesome Range Rover, which I'm gonna sell, and then I'm gonna get myself an Alfa Romeo.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Just me and a babe.</p>
<p>Just me and a babe.</p>
<p>So, you guys do whatever you want.</p>
<p>(Dusty moaning passionately)</p>
<p>Do you like it?</p>
<p>(moaning continues)</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Why would you say that?</p>
<p>I'm just kidding.</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys, I got news.</p>
<p>I got terrible news.</p>
<p>Wait, dude, do I...?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, yeah. Hey.</p>
<p>You're the... you're that guy from the other night.</p>
<p>I didn't... I didn't recognize you without the hairpiece.</p>
<p>This is awful.</p>
<p>There's a Jew trying to buy us out of everything.</p>
<p>You want to get him back?</p>
<p>What are you... what are you talking about?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>W-Well, I'm not usually the idea man; I'm the money man.</p>
<p>Okay, don't worry about it.</p>
<p>What we'll do is we'll have a beer, and then we'll come up with something.</p>
<p>Okay. You know, we really appreciated the drinks the other night, but we... we've got to get to work.</p>
<p>You got to get a ferret down in the basement, because Charlie says ferrets scare the shit out of rats.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>What is... what is... who... who is Charlie?</p>
<p>You're Charlie.</p>
<p>No, you're too tall.</p>
<p>By any chance, do you have homosexual tendencies?</p>
<p>You... you could be Dee, but you're smaller.</p>
<p>You got a better body, I think.</p>
<p>You-- I don't know... I don't know who the hell you are, 'cause we didn't have a black.</p>
<p>Sir, you got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I got to prove myself, right?</p>
<p>Okay, I get it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get to work, and I'll make it really happen, and this is so exciting.</p>
<p>You guys, this is gonna be great.</p>
<p>Our thinking: clear.</p>
<p>Our rhymes: no fear.</p>
<p>Our words, our passion that flows like beer.</p>
<p>Misery!</p>
<p>Chains.</p>
<p>Thunder.</p>
<p>Rain.</p>
<p>We're chasing the dragon.</p>
<p>We're chasing our pain.</p>
<p>Now, stop, breathe.</p>
<p>Unbroken.</p>
<p>You're free.</p>
<p>(both sigh deeply)</p>
<p>shit, that's def.</p>
<p>That's super def right there.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, that was the deffest.</p>
<p>Hey, here's a crazy idea.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Why don't we run out, go to an open-mic night, like, right now?</p>
<p>Right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, Dee.</p>
<p>I'm scared.</p>
<p>No, I know, but look, without Mac and Dennis, like, constantly coming down on us, you're not gonna bomb.</p>
<p>You're gonna do great.</p>
<p>You know, I-I just feel like I'm feeling something.</p>
<p>I'm totally feeling it.</p>
<p>Something, like, crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I guess we make a really good... make a really good team.</p>
<p>We do make a really good team.</p>
<p>You're calming me down, and we're good at this together.</p>
<p>Cool, cool. All right.</p>
<p>Let's do it. That's great.</p>
<p>Let's go to it.</p>
<p>(both chuckle)</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Whoops!</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>(both groan goofily)</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Great crowd, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, big night!</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Beer me.</p>
<p>What a crowd, huh?</p>
<p>Oh. Hi.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's-it's good.</p>
<p>It's busy.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Wait, you brought all these people here?</p>
<p>I bought them all fake I.D.s.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. These are all underage kids-- tweens and such.</p>
<p>I never got to do that scheme.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why-why would you do this?</p>
<p>I don't know why they did it.</p>
<p>They must've had a good reason.</p>
<p>Oh, also, I let a ferret loose in here and called the health inspector.</p>
<p>What?! Why?!</p>
<p>So you could do the thing, you know... snap to.</p>
<p>You better do it quick, too.</p>
<p>That kid looks sick as hell.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You guys selling the car?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>(clears throat) Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, uh, might like to buy it.</p>
<p>What do you want for it?</p>
<p>Well, I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of the original price, but, uh... considering the circumstances, I'm open to a reasonable discussion.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I mean, it is an amphibious exploring vehicle, so it should be fine, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>It's nice to talk to a reasonable man.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Now, are you a sportsman?</p>
<p>Because you look very fit.</p>
<p>Oh, I ski.</p>
<p>You ski?</p>
<p>Oh, excellent.</p>
<p>Love skiing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you travel a lot?</p>
<p>For work, yeah.</p>
<p>Europe? Eastern Europe?</p>
<p>Ah, all over, really.</p>
<p>And I assume you'll be taking the car with you on these trips?</p>
<p>Me? Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I'm-I'm looking for something for my daughter.</p>
<p>Your daughter?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, safe, slow vehicle.</p>
<p>Good starter car.</p>
<p>Starter car.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>

<p>Begone, vile man!</p>
<p>Begone from me!</p>
<p>A starter car?!</p>
<p>This car is a finisher car!</p>
<p>A transporter of gods!</p>
<p>The golden god!</p>
<p>I am untethered and my rage knows no bounds!</p>
<p>Well, we're gonna figure this out.</p>
<p>I know.</p>

<p>You want to do something with this?</p>
<p>(roars) We lost it.</p>
<p>(crying): We lost our bar.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. The health inspector called the police, man.</p>
<p>The control board pulled our liquor license.</p>
<p>And we got a $75,000 fine for serving minors.</p>
<p>Well, uh, the other crew always had something up their sleeve.</p>
<p>I got an idea.</p>
<p>We don't want to hear your ideas.</p>
<p>This is all your fault.</p>
<p>No... well, wait, Kelly.</p>
<p>Maybe he can help us.</p>
<p>It sounds like he's used to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, that-that's true.</p>
<p>He got us into this mess.</p>
<p>Maybe he can get us out of it.</p>
<p>Okay, old man.</p>
<p>What's your plan?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>(crying)</p>
<p>Can I, um...?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There's a beer I want to...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So, you know, just... all right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm s... sorry.</p>
<p>Okay. Do you want one, or...?</p>
<p>No. I... don't.</p>
<p>All right. Good.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>(Charlie chuckles)</p>
<p>Is it cold in here?</p>
<p>I'm not a thermostat, so...</p>
<p>Okay. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, all right, listen-- I want things to go back to normal, okay?</p>
<p>I don't like the way things have become, and I want them to go back to the way they were.</p>
<p>Listen up. I want things to go back to normal.</p>
<p>I don't like the way things are going.</p>
<p>I want 'em to go back to normal.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, man?</p>
<p>I'm storming in.</p>
<p>I was storming in...</p>
<p>What, are you a man cheetah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>You like it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right. Good.</p>
<p>All right, come on, let's...</p>
<p>I can't do this anymore.</p>
<p>That last crew sucked on ice.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I like the man cheetah thing.</p>
<p>I want to go back to doing shit like this.</p>
<p>Are you guys on board?</p>
<p>I want to go back to the way things were.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I mean, we definitely...</p>
<p>Definitely want things to be normal again.</p>
<p>We should go back in time.</p>
<p>Can we go way back in time?</p>
<p>Can we go back a lot?</p>
<p>Okay, did you bomb and fail and bomb, just like I knew you would?</p>
<p>He did. He did.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, yeah, that's all that happened, and nothing else happened other than that.</p>
<p>There was a poetry thing.</p>
<p>It was bad.</p>
<p>It was really bad poetry, and... shut up, bird!</p>
<p>You shut up! You can't read!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Okay, this is good, all right. Yeah, yeah. (roaring)</p>
<p>Yeah, hey.</p>
<p>Okay, this is good, this is good. So we're all in agreement?</p>
<p>Frank, pay to get my car out of the river.</p>
<p>Yes. Done.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>(Dusty moaning passionately)</p>
<p>Aah, shit, that's starting again.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>Mac's not gonna want to go back to normal.</p>
<p>He's been banging that hot chick in the back office all day.</p>
<p>No, I don't like this, okay?</p>
<p>It's unnatural, and I won't have it.</p>
<p>I'm putting an end to this right now-- we're going back to normal, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, you like it?</p>
<p>You know what...?</p>
<p>(moaning stops)</p>
<p>What the hell's going on in here?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Oh, we totally just banged or whatever.</p>
<p>You're fully clothed, Mac.</p>
<p>Have you been pretending to bang this chick the entire time?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He can't even get it up with me.</p>
<p>What? That's because she's not even that hot.</p>
<p>She is very hot.</p>
<p>I don't know, I'm not even feeling that.</p>
<p>Can I get my angel dust now?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude.</p>
<p>Come on, buddy, you don't have to...</p>
<p>Guys, listen, it's fine.</p>
<p>It's all good, Mac.</p>
<p>Do you want to go back to the way things were?</p>
<p>We don't ask questions, you just go about your business?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>I was hoping this day would come.</p>
<p>I saved a special surprise for us.</p>
<p>Is he a man cheetah? Awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why, cool.</p>
<p>Who wants rum ham?</p>
