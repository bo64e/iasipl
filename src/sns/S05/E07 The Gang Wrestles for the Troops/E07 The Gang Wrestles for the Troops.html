<p>I have a question though.</p>
<p>What's going on with Hulk Hogan's hair?</p>
<p>It's blond and yet it's silken, like that of a Chinese man.</p>
<p>Ah yes...</p>
<p>Uh, that is Hulk Hogan's signature's look.</p>
<p>Blonde, Chinese hair...</p>
<p>And skin of a hot dog.</p>
<p>It's awesome.</p>
<p>The whole thing's fake, but it's really awesome.</p>
<p>Fake? What the hell are you talking about, fake? It's not fake.</p>
<p>Those guys got bashed and bloody.</p>
<p>I seen guys get pounded in the ring.</p>
<p>It's still fake, no dude.</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie...</p>
<p>I was there once, I saw a guy pick up a trash can...</p>
<p>Smash it into a guy's head.</p>
<p>Blood went everywhere.</p>
<p>Okay, what is going on here?</p>
<p>Ohhh Yeah! Right here he's going into a state of 'Hulkamania'.</p>
<p>Okay, when he's like this, nothing can hurt you.</p>
<p>It's like a seizure of strength.</p>

<p>You know, not like we were in the 80's.</p>
<p>On the 80's we were so patriotic. Oh man!</p>
<p>And when Hogan was doing his thing, and we were killing Iranians, or whatever... I mean we were proud!</p>
<p>There's no fanfare.</p>
<p>There's no parade.</p>

<p>Nope!</p>
<p>Nobody is tricking anybody!</p>
<p>You know? We gotta do something about this.</p>
<p>Cus... Cus... People just aren't showing their appreciation for these guys.</p>
<p>We gotta show them the love.</p>

<p>Let's move pass it for now.</p>
<p>You know let's..</p>
<p>Focus on our stuff. Let's focus on on...</p>
<p>The most important part of our routine is the entrance.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Frank, what the hell are you doing man?</p>
<p>That's my character, I'm the Trash Man.</p>
<p>I come out, I throw trash all over... all over the ring...</p>
<p>And then, I start eating garbage.</p>
<p>And then I pick up the trash can...</p>
<p>And I, smash the guy on the head. Oh...</p>
<p>That's gonna be a disaster.</p>
<p>No, no, nobody's gonna get hurt.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, like you said... It's all fake.</p>
<p>But it has nothing to do with the troops, Frank.</p>
<p>A sixty year old man eating trash, who wants to see that?</p>
<p>Nah, but that's what people want. Hey...</p>
<p>I got something for you. I got a character for you.</p>
<p>You can be... The ref.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna be the ref.</p>
<p>I'm a villain, don't you see?</p>
<p>Pick up the garbage... and then I uh....</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Just nasty dude!</p>
<p>Are you choking?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh!</p>
<p>No, throw it up in the bathroom. Get out of here.</p>
<p>Go take a break. Go take a break.</p>
<p>The troops are going to be very happy to see that.</p>
<p>Alright, let's get this...</p>
<p>Let's, let's...</p>
<p>Let's get back to it... Just... Charlie.</p>
<p>So we're talking about the entrances okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, we got a good idea. Okay.</p>
<p>We got a good idea.</p>
<p>Alright now, they are going to announce our name: Birds of War.</p>
<p>Oh, I loved that name.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe we'll do an eagle screech.. *Screeching* That'll be great.</p>
<p>And then we'll start out.. We'll come out of the tunnel, we'll start out.</p>
<p>We're gonna write this great song.</p>
<p>It's gonna be how bad ass we are.</p>
<p>You know what I mean.</p>
<p>It's all about the...</p>
<p>About how we soar through the air, how we live in a nest top.</p>
<p>How we like to protect our eggs from predators.</p>
<p>And our young, we regurgitate to our...</p>
<p>All the...</p>
<p>Actually, can I stop you guys for one second?</p>
<p>Because what you just... described, Nah, it seems like we're just singing...</p>
<p>About the life style of an eagle. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well I was under the impression that we were presenting ourselves as bird men.</p>
<p>Which, to me... Is infinitely cooler than just sorta being a bird.</p>
<p>No No No... It's good... We can meet in the middle thou... We can... maybe Maybe... It's just already the middle...</p>
<p>That's all I ask, that's all I ask...</p>
<p>I want people to be able to see that we're not just birds.</p>
<p>Thanks you for stepping in as Desert Rose.</p>
<p>Uh, no problem. I dated a lot of disable men in my past, so...</p>
<p>I enjoyed the power. Okay...</p>
<p>Why aren't you wearing red?</p>
<p>I was very specific about that.</p>
<p>I don't' do red.</p>
<p>Well, you look like a grape.</p>
<p>Fine, then I'll be Desert Grape.</p>
<p>No, he wasn't talking to Desert Grape, He was talking to Desert Rose, it's very specific and...</p>
<p>Alright, you know what, alright, this is what we'll do, just put this here.</p>

<p>Oh, you're sweaty. Oh, Okay.</p>
<p>It's humid outside.</p>
<p>So uh, which one is he?</p>
<p>Right behind you in yellow.</p>
<p>Ah, mama like...</p>
<p>Cute, right?</p>
<p>Hey, did he send you any dick pics.</p>
<p>Because it could be a mess down there.</p>
<p>For the love of god, please don't ask him about his dick.</p>
<p>Okay, have it your way, I'll figure it out soon enough.</p>
<p>And away we go.</p>
<p>Oh, she looks ridiculous.</p>
<p>Desert Rose?</p>
<p>Hi What... What the hell?</p>
<p>Oh, it feels so good to finally hold you.</p>
<p>Oh you... You're... You're biting my lips.</p>

<p>I thought there was a wheelchair and you were in it.</p>
<p>Oh no, no I... I twisted my knee getting of a plane in Germany.</p>
<p>I'm uh. I was just trying to stay off of it. Mmm, it's good now, you see?</p>
<p>Yes it is. Can I talk to you for a sec?</p>
<p>I'll be back. What is it? What, what?</p>
<p>I changed my mind, so move out of the way so I can swoop in. Nah Uh...</p>
<p>No chang-ies.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Artemis, I'm warning you, if you don't get out of the way right now. I'm going to bring out the big guns.</p>
<p>Oh, hit me with your best shot you stupid bitch!</p>
<p>I was looking around, I was thinking...</p>

<p>You just...</p>
<p>I'm sorry for that. You just...</p>
<p>I... just props I thought I was bringing.</p>
<p>That is not a prop though, that's sharp razor wires.</p>
<p>Mr. Manic, we were thinking that maybe we could go a little more traditional with it.</p>
<p>You know just, figure 4 leg lock, pile driver...</p>

<p>Oh, no no...</p>
<p>People, that old school bullshit...</p>

<p>Okay, alright We got a problem...</p>
<p>I don't know...</p>
<p>What... what was he talking about with his kids?</p>
<p>Did he killed his kids?</p>
<p>He just...</p>
<p>Drifted away and uh...</p>
<p>Look at it, look at this, I feel like he's living out of his car right?</p>
<p>I mean he's got blankets in there.</p>
<p>What is that? A pile of laundry...</p>
<p>Look at this dude, that's just a bucket of chestnuts.</p>
<p>What, is he just foraging for his food?</p>
<p>I don't know why the hell would you have a bucket of chestnuts, bro?</p>
<p>We are dealing with a legitimate maniac now.</p>
<p>That is clear to me, his mania is not confined to the ring.</p>
<p>No, he kept calling you the N word earlier.</p>
<p>Yea, I didn't, I wasn't gonna bring that up, I don't' want to freak him out.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Yes, Yes.</p>
<p>He was calling me the N word.</p>
<p>Every time you turned your back.</p>
<p>He's like you stupid N, go get me grease.</p>
<p>And this and that.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I don't' know, did he say why?</p>
<p>He has a problem with...</p>
<p>Black people and he likes to...</p>
<p>Why does he have a problem with me?</p>
<p>I mean I don't understand.</p>
<p>Both, I think...</p>
<p>Oh my god, okay.</p>
<p>Let's get rid of him.</p>
<p>Let's get rid of him, thats it.</p>
<p>How you get rid of a guy like that?</p>
<p>I don't want to be anywhere in the ring with that guy.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>What if we were just hype men?</p>
<p>We don't even go in the ring.</p>
<p>Yes, we let him do the wrestling.</p>
<p>We do not wrestle?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Alright, we gotta find someone for him to wrestle though.</p>
<p>Right right. Okay.</p>
<p>Someone who has like...</p>
<p>You know nothing to lose, right?</p>

<p>Cricket, how about this?</p>
<p>It's for the troops.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit about the troops.</p>

<p>What happens in the ring, happens in the ring, Cricket.</p>
<p>It's really up to you.</p>
<p>I don't feel we're reading as eagles.</p>
<p>No bro, we look like assholes.</p>
<p>It didn't turn out the way I had envisioned.</p>
<p>I'm getting more of a chicken vibe.</p>
<p>What in gods name is this about?</p>
