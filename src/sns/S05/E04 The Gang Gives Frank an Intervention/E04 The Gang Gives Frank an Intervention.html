<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hey, come on, man. Be careful, man.</p>
<p>You're spilling on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I don't understand why you don't just use a cup.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Inconspicu...</p>
<p>Your entire mouth is stained red, Frank. It is?</p>
<p>Yeah. Aren't we gonna be at the barbecue soon?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm pregaming, man. What's going on with you?</p>
<p>You're going off the deep end lately.</p>
<p>I feel like he's been wading around in the deep end for a while.</p>
<p>No, bro, it's different.</p>
<p>He's staying out all hours of the night.</p>
<p>I never see him. If he is around, he's usually not even wearing clothes.</p>
<p>[Mac, Dennis Laughing]</p>
<p>I'm wearing clothes now, bitch.</p>
<p>You're wearing a shirt that's on inside out and it's covered in grease.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're really greasy.</p>
<p>It's not grease. It's sap.</p>
<p>Sap? How did you get covered in sap?</p>
<p>I got really wasted.</p>
<p>I must've climbed a tree.</p>
<p>You're really stepping up the insanity, huh?</p>
<p>I'm trying to push myself.</p>
<p>I want to see how far I could go.</p>
<p>I feel like you've been standing on the edge of a cliff for a while now.</p>
<p>I say hop off.</p>
<p>Let's see where you land.</p>
<p>I really wish you wouldn't encourage him, man.</p>
<p>I really wish you wouldn't.</p>
<p>If somebody wants to push his boundaries, you gotta let him. Frank, jump.</p>
<p>I never felt more alive in my life.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.</p>
<p>There's the street, right there.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I thought we were going to a barbecue, Frank.</p>
<p>It's more of a party in the park.</p>
<p>We're at a cemetery.</p>
<p>The party is in the cemetery.</p>
<p>Who has a party in a cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Your Uncle Max.</p>
<p>He just croaked.</p>
<p>Flush that turd down the drain!</p>
<p>[Chuckles]</p>
<p>♪♪ [Bagpipes: "Amazing Grace"]</p>
<p>Does anybody else feel really uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Yes. We're completely underdressed. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>What are we doing here, Frank? What's your angle?</p>
<p>I wanna bang your Aunt Donna.</p>
<p>Why would you wanna bang our mom's sister... at the funeral of her husband?</p>
<p>Hmm. Well, I don't know how many years on this earth I got left.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get real weird with it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, block the wind.</p>
<p>I'm gonna roast this bone.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Come on. Get in there.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>That is enough. I've had enough.</p>
<p>He's definitely reached his limit.</p>
<p>I've reached my limit, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Dude, this is what I was talking about in the car.</p>
<p>The guy is going off the deep end, all right?</p>
<p>Now it's starting to affect our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think maybe we should have an intervention or something.</p>
<p>An intervention might be a good idea.</p>
<p>If he starts banging Aunt Donna, we're gonna have the garbage pail cousin in the mix.</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Whoa. Who is the garbage pail cousin?</p>
<p>Gail the Snail is the garbage pail cousin.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, she is the worst.</p>
<p>We'd have these family parties and she'd just glob onto me and Dennis.</p>
<p>We couldn't get rid of her.</p>
<p>The only way was to torture her.</p>
<p>And that's what we did. Yeah.</p>
<p>We'd throw her in the dryer.</p>
<p>We'd throw salt on her. Yeah, we'd throw salt on her 'cause she was the snail.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Get it? Get it?</p>
<p>You throw salt on a snail, and...</p>
<p>It shrivels her up.</p>
<p>It's supposed to shrivel up.</p>
<p>Well, that sounds a little messed up though, huh?</p>
<p>You don't think we're proud of that, do you? No.</p>
<p>But you don't understand.</p>
<p>That's the only way you can handle her.</p>
<p>She made us do those things.</p>
<p>And quite frankly, I resent her for it.</p>
<p>What kind of a person salts another human being? It's terrible.</p>
<p>There's no joy in salting someone.</p>
<p>Everyone loses. Yeah.</p>
<p>It sounds like a-</p>
<p>What's up, suckers?</p>
<p>Hey, Gail.</p>
<p>Hey, Gail.</p>
<p>You look different. I'm more confident.</p>
<p>I've grown into my body.</p>
<p>You're sure showing a lot of skin, huh?</p>
<p>Jealous? I'm a woman now.</p>
<p>I'm not a virgin anymore.</p>
<p>Cool. Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>[Slurps] Hey, guys, you wanna come to my car and take a puff?</p>
<p>I got some medical marijuana.</p>
<p>[Slurps]</p>
<p>We're at your dad's funeral, Gail.</p>
<p>What evs. I'm over it.</p>
<p>Plus, if we all showed up super high at the reception, everyone would be like, "What?" [Slurps]</p>
<p>Uh- Uh- Okay.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Whatever, Gail.</p>
<p>Yes, we'll do that.</p>
<p>Wait in the car and we'll join you.</p>
<p>We'll come get you.</p>
<p>You guys gonna come?</p>
<p>We'll come in a second.</p>
<p>Like five minutes?</p>
<p>Five minutes. - Anything. Yes.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>Whatever you say.</p>
<p>[Growls] See, this is what happens when you don't have salt.</p>
<p>My God. There's not enough salt in the world for her.</p>
<p>The garbage pail cousin.</p>
<p>Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna.</p>
<p>Hello, Frank.</p>
<p>You surprised to see me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You left several voice mails... congratulating me on my husband's death.</p>
<p>Well, I was pretty baked.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>I have a proposition for you.</p>
<p>I think you and me ought to bang.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay. Hear me out.</p>
<p>Max never liked me.</p>
<p>I hated him.</p>
<p>Barbara didn't like you.</p>
<p>You despised her.</p>
<p>Now, what better way to get back at them in the grave, really stick it to 'em, if you and me plowed?</p>
<p>I mean, really- [Grinds Teeth] Hmm?</p>
<p>You get back to me.</p>
<p>Hey. I'm Mac.</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p>Barbara's ex-lover.</p>
<p>She may have mentioned...</p>
<p>You were gonna say something?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>[Lips Smack]</p>
<p>You said- No?</p>
<p>No. I was just breathing.</p>
<p>I'll start by commending you guys... for taking the initiative to help Frank.</p>
<p>Ah, we're caring people.</p>
<p>That's our nature.</p>
<p>Um, what's Frank struggling with the most right now?</p>
<p>Ooh. Ah, he is trying to bang our aunt.</p>
<p>That's the big one.</p>
<p>Uh, these things deal more with drug and alcohol abuse. <strong>Dee</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>drug and alcohol are rolled into what we're talking about here...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>With the aunt thing.</p>
<p>So he does have a drinking problem.</p>
<p>Oh, big time. Big time.</p>
<p>Oh, lady.</p>
<p>But if I'm being honest, my problem's less with the fact... that he's drinking and more that he's doing it without me.</p>
<p>And then I start thinking, "What's wrong with me?</p>
<p>Am I not fun to drink with?"</p>
<p>Oh, no. Don't do that to yourself.</p>
<p>You're plenty of fun to drink with.</p>
<p>Trust me, Charlie.</p>
<p>You get really, really drunk. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And then you get reckless, and it's a lot of fun.</p>
<p>So how do we go about doing this?</p>
<p>Do we ambush him and then sort of like berate him... into becoming the guy we wanna be around?</p>
<p>You certainly don't berate him.</p>
<p>He needs to know you're coming from a place of love and concern.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. Too soft.</p>
<p>I think we should come at him with an iron fist and crush him into submission.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>If we're taking that approach, you might wanna be armed at this intervention. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Why- Why would I need to be armed?</p>
<p>Well, Frank's usually carrying a little gun with him.</p>
<p>And he doesn't really hesitate to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: And you know what?</p>
<p>Have the gun out and ready to rock when he comes in.</p>
<p>We'll all have guns. - It's just safer.</p>
<p>She could put it in her pants.</p>
<p>If we maybe ambush Frank with a net... or some kind of rope device, the gun will maybe drop out of his waist belt.</p>
<p>You wanna bring him in in a net?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: That could get awkward.</p>
<p>Just bring the gun.</p>
<p>Bring a gun. I don't wanna get shot, so just bring a gun, will you?</p>
<p>You know, I do offer group therapy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What is this you're doing?</p>
<p>What is that? What is that?</p>
<p>With all due respect, you're talking about bringing guns to an intervention, and you're drinking wine out of a soda can.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You put wine in the soda can?</p>
<p>You didn't know, did you?</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Soda.</p>
<p>You stole Frank's idea.</p>
<p>Actually, it's a pretty good one.</p>
<p>It's a good idea.</p>
<p>The guy's got great ideas. He's a smart man.</p>
<p>That's not what we're here about.</p>
<p>But I do feel like she just tried an intervention on us. - Did you intervene on us?</p>
<p>You know what I'm feeling? I'm feeling like you've lost control of the room here.</p>
<p>And we're the ones that are running things now.</p>
<p>I've lost my trust in you.</p>
<p>We can do this on our own.</p>
<p>We can do the intervention without her.</p>
<p>You guys think?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>All right. Might as well give it a shot.</p>
<p>Let's just do that.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Thank you. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>You did your best.</p>
<p>After you.</p>
<p>No hard feelings.</p>
<p>I'm gonna grab some of this literature.</p>
<p>She didn't do that great of a job.</p>
<p>No, but don't beat her while she's down.</p>
<p>[Chuckles, Gurgling]</p>
<p>[Gurgling Continues] Frank, here's another idea.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>Where'd you come from?</p>
<p>I've been walking next to you the entire time.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm a little, uh, lit.</p>
<p>And, uh, I've been going over this thing.</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out how-</p>
<p>How to bang Donna. I know.</p>
<p>You've been talking about it for the last five miles.</p>
<p>Dude, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I got a better idea.</p>
<p>I think you should bang Gail the Snail.</p>
<p>My niece?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gail the Snail? Dude, what's more depraved than that, huh?</p>
<p>Plus, you're not blood related, so it's not that weird.</p>
<p>[Belches] That is a good idea.</p>
<p>I like the way you're thinking.</p>
<p>[Belching]</p>
<p>Ew!</p>
<p>What's in it for you?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>[Belching]</p>
<p>Oh! Jesus!</p>
<p>What's in it for you?</p>
<p>Don't worry about what's in it for me, dude.</p>
<p>[Belches]</p>
<p>Good God! You are disgusting.</p>
<p>A disgusting animal.</p>
<p>[Belches, Gurgling]</p>
<p>Mm. Charlie.</p>
<p>Let's write him a letter.</p>
<p>Let's write Frank a letter.</p>
<p>That's the first step in any intervention, right?</p>
<p>Huh. Yeah.</p>
<p>Great. All right.</p>
<p>So I'm assuming you'll have to dictate yours to me, and then I'll just write it down for you, yeah?</p>
<p>Yes, that'll be fine.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Let's- Let's do that.</p>
<p>Okay, uh, I guess my letter would be about... how Frank and I aren't really making memories together anymore, and how when we don't make memories together, that's a hurtful thing for me.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, you know, let's just dive right in.</p>
<p>I'm not even gonna try and suss out where you're going with that one.</p>
<p>Right. Um, number one... when was the last time we played Night Crawlers together, Frank?</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, okay.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Well, it's not about you.</p>
<p>Why don't you just write it down, and then...</p>
<p>Yeah, but you said it.</p>
<p>You said "Night Crawlers," and now I feel like I can't move past it.</p>
<p>I gotta know what that is.</p>
<p>It's- It's no big deal.</p>
<p>You know? I...</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd just write it down because it's not really a big deal.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It's what it sounds like.</p>
<p>What it sounds like is that you two crawl around like worms in the night.</p>
<p>That's what it sounds like.</p>
<p>[Smacks Lips] This is not about you, so I'd like for you...</p>
<p>[Metal Banging]</p>
<p>Damn! Shut up! Guess what!</p>
<p>What? We got you!</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>I thought when Frank comes in, we'll just bang and make a bunch of noise.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Ha!</p>
<p>We've got you! All right.</p>
<p>But the pain is a little agitating.</p>
<p>That's overboard, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: It's too much?</p>
<p>I think that's too far.</p>
<p>The yelling and pointing and accusing and saying that he's trapped and surrounded... is probably gonna be-</p>
<p>That's gonna be great.</p>
<p>By the way, you guys, can I just say, as a side note, I am loving this canned wine thing.</p>
<p>I think it's brilliant.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I'm active. I'm gesturing with my hands, and I don't feel restricted.</p>
<p>If I was holding a wine glass, I'd be spilling wine all over the goddamn place.</p>
<p>It would get everywhere. We're not intervening on Frank for a lack of good ideas.</p>
<p>Well, that's for sure. Oh, no.</p>
<p>Well, guys, maybe we're not doing the right thing.</p>
<p>You're talking a lot about wine.</p>
<p>You got it all over your lips and teeth.</p>
<p>Maybe we need the help of a professional.</p>
<p>We should probably get that lady back.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>We're coming up with all kinds of good ideas.</p>
<p>We're flowing here.</p>
<p>I feel like we got some good stuff.</p>
<p>I just feel like- Maybe we should consult with the pamphlets, right?</p>
<p>The pamphlets I grabbed from the office.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, I've been meaning to bring that up.</p>
<p>I took a lot at those pamphlets that you grabbed, and not a single one of them has anything to do with intervention.</p>
<p>It's not even close. I'm starting to think we need to intervene on you... for your goddamn illiteracy.</p>
<p>Yeah, Charlie, you are getting real dumb.</p>
<p>Come on. All right. See, this is what I'm talking about. Illiteracy.</p>
<p>What does that word even mean?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get the lady, 'cause this is gettin' crazy.</p>
<p>We need help.</p>
<p>I'm gettin' the lady.</p>
<p>[Sizzling]</p>
<p>♪♪ [Humming]</p>

<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>How you doin', Frank?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>Frank, my plan is finally coming together.</p>
<p>With you out of the picture, I can swoop in on Donna.</p>
<p>Is that why you pushed me off onto the Snail?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right, bitch.</p>
<p>But that's what you wanted anyway, right?</p>
<p>You wanted to be as depraved as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I think the Snail is too depraved even for me.</p>
<p>This broad is berserk.</p>
<p>[Gail] Wake and bake.</p>
<p>You guys bang?</p>
<p>Oh, no. We did a bunch of those Monster Energy drinks and dry humped. It was awful.</p>
<p>I think she gave me poison ivy.</p>
<p>[Grunts]</p>
<p>Hey, hey there, sleepyhead.</p>
<p>I made you breakfast.</p>
<p>I hope you like it crispy 'cause it is burned.</p>
<p>What is going on in here?</p>
<p>How did you get in my house?</p>
<p>Did you kick in my door?</p>
<p>Kick, yes. Kick in, no.</p>
<p>That door is solid, which is the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is the window is not.</p>
<p>That's gonna be a security concern.</p>
<p>But don't worry.</p>
<p>I'm gonna fix it, make sure it's up to snuff.</p>
<p>You're always safe when you're with me.</p>
<p>Are you ready for your breakfast?</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>What is happening here?</p>
<p>I haven't any idea, honestly.</p>
<p>I'm giving Frank a handy under the table.</p>
<p>[Groans] That is true.</p>
<p>Look, Snail- Back off.</p>
<p>Because you're just mashing it now. It's not...</p>
<p>For God sakes, Gail.</p>
<p>Mom, I'm sexually active now.</p>
<p>Get over it.</p>
<p>You're 33 years old.</p>
<p>You're supposed to be sexually active.</p>
<p>You're not supposed to be fondling your uncle under a table.</p>
<p>We're not blood related.</p>
<p>Will you just please leave her alone?</p>
<p>I'll make a deal with you.</p>
<p>I dump the Snail if you and I go out.</p>
<p>Frank, you can't do that.</p>
<p>Donna's my girl.</p>
<p>I called her first at the funeral.</p>
<p>Fair is fair.</p>
<p>Let me make something perfectly clear.</p>
<p>I will never be with either of you.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p>Why can't you just let me be happy?</p>
<p>I want everybody out of my house.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Out of my house!</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Not you. You live here, Gail.</p>
<p>I hate it here. I'm leaving.</p>
<p>I'm going with this guy. He's my boyfriend.</p>
<p>I'm taking some eggs.</p>
<p>I am not your boyfriend.</p>
<p>Frank, what is with this chick?</p>
<p>She's berserk.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. I get it.</p>
<p>So Frank sits there, and we put stools in a semicircle.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure there's a border all around him... so there's no going anywhere.</p>
<p>And zing him from every angle.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>There she is!</p>
<p>Hey! Hey!</p>
<p>Thank you for coming!</p>
<p>[Laughs] - We really appreciate this.</p>
<p>We really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Well, I'm here because clearly your friend is in desperate need of help.</p>
<p>[All] Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>Well, we realize we also just need as many people attacking this guy... as we can possibly get.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, not attacking.</p>
<p>This is why I'm glad you called me back.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, listen.</p>
<p>Before we get into that, could you help us pop a quick intervention on Charlie for his illiteracy?</p>
<p>The kid can't read or write.</p>
<p>Not a bit.</p>
<p>[Laughing] - No joke.</p>
<p>It's no joke.</p>
<p>They've been riding me all day. I can read and write.</p>
<p>I just don't like to read and write.</p>
<p>Let's try and stay focused on Frank.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>He's gonna be here any second.</p>
<p>We told him there was a giant grease fire... and he had to come down immediately.</p>
<p>[Charlie, Dennis Chuckling]</p>
<p>Uh-oh. She's- I'm assuming you wouldn't have lured him down with a fire.</p>
<p>Is that what your face is doing right now?</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, and I wouldn't have an intervention at a bar either.</p>
<p>[Laughing] Well, lady, look, all mistakes we've made on our own, so it's good that you're here.</p>
<p>We're doing our best.</p>
<p>We're doing our best.</p>
<p>Where's the goddamn fire?</p>
<p>[Gun Cocks]</p>
<p>Intervention! Intervention!</p>
<p>Ah, intervention!</p>
<p>Intervention! I got it! I got it!</p>
<p>You're surrounded, Frank!</p>
<p>There's nowhere for you to go.</p>
<p>You're trapped. You're trapped.</p>
<p>[All Chanting] You're trapped!</p>
<p>You're trapped!</p>
<p>Got you! Got you!</p>
<p>You're trapped!</p>
<p>That's enough! That's enough!</p>
<p>We told you there was gonna be a gun.</p>
<p>What the hell's going on?</p>
<p>Got you, man!</p>
<p>Sit down! You sit down so we can tell you what an asshole you've been.</p>
<p>We're gonna get all in your face and point out your faults.</p>
<p>A roast? I've always wanted to be roasted.</p>
<p>Oh, wait. Let me just switch gears here... fire up this spliff.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Wait. Frank, hold on.</p>
<p>Um, everyone's here today because they care about you and they want you to get well.</p>
<p>She ain't funny. Next.</p>
<p>Frank, you're an asshole.</p>
<p>Ah! That's it.</p>
<p>Now rain down on me.</p>
<p>Come on. - You're a prick!</p>
<p>And your addiction has affected us in the following ways.</p>
<p>You are annoying!</p>
<p>Dennis, come on!</p>
<p>Give it to me with both barrels!</p>
<p>Why do we never play Night Crawlers anymore, huh?</p>
<p>I don't know, Charlie.</p>
<p>What is Night Crawlers? It's a game where they crawl around in the night like worms.</p>
<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that's what it is.</p>
<p>Intervention! Intervention!</p>
<p>Is nothing private, Frank?</p>
<p>Jesus! Look, I like that game.</p>
<p>I don't wanna stop playing it.</p>
<p>Well, Charlie, we can play that game.</p>
<p>You promise?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoo! Ahh!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Stop touching me.</p>
<p>[Speaks, Indistinct]</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Just stop.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Whoa! What's this?</p>
<p>Me and Mac are together.</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Intervention! Intervention!</p>
<p>Intervention!</p>
<p>What are you interventioning me for?</p>
<p>Because you can't be banging Gail the Snail.</p>
<p>I'm not banging Gail the Snail.</p>
<p>She followed me home.</p>
<p>[Slurps] Oh!</p>
<p>She was doing that the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, she does that.</p>
<p>Swallow it or spit it out.</p>
<p>No, don't!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>Intervention!</p>
<p>Hey, babe, I'll get you a drink from the bar.</p>
<p>Great. My God.</p>
<p>What are you doing, Mac?</p>
<p>I was just going over to her house to try and bang Donna... because she reminds me so much of your mom, which is the best sex I ever had.</p>
<p>[Groans] - Intervention.</p>
<p>Intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p>You banged my dead wife?</p>
<p>Well, she was alive at the time.</p>
<p>But- Did you not know that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's cool, man. It's cool.</p>
<p>Intervention. Intervention. Okay?</p>
<p>Look, he's got a weird fetish for older women, so don't hold it against him.</p>
<p>I don't have an older-woman fetish.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do.</p>
<p>I don't wanna bang this chick.</p>
<p>Let's cool it with the intervention stuff for a second...</p>
<p>'cause there's a lot of 'em being thrown around right now, and I'm having a little bit of trouble keeping track.</p>
<p>The most important intervention is the one we need to do on Gail the Snail... and getting her out of our lives.</p>
<p>Guys, let's do shots and get crazy.</p>
<p>No, Gail. No. We're intervening on you, Snail.</p>
<p>Go. Get out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>How is she not getting this?</p>
<p>She's stonewalling us.</p>
<p>It is a classic Snail technique. Classic.</p>
<p>Ya! Get out of here, Snail!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: He's got the salt!</p>
<p>Salt the Snail!</p>
<p>Ya, ya, ya!</p>
<p>Go, Snail!</p>
<p>Ya, ya, ya!</p>
<p>Ya! Ya!</p>
<p>Hey, guys! Guys, guys!</p>
<p>I was gonna invite you guys all to a rave to hang out, but now I don't wanna hang out with you anymore.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Salt the Snail.</p>
<p>Just salt her.</p>
<p>Wait, wait!</p>
<p>Do you guys wanna go?</p>
<p>No, no! We don't wanna go!</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>I have glow sticks.</p>
<p>Salt the Snail!</p>
<p>[All Shouting]</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: The whole thing!</p>
<p>Ya, ya, ya!</p>
<p>What is with that broad?</p>
<p>She is the worst, right?</p>
<p>That's what we've been saying.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. That was a terrible experience for me by the way.</p>
<p>Of course it was. Nobody likes salting the Snail, but she gives you no choice.</p>
<p>She doesn't leave you with any options.</p>
<p>What a horrible thing.</p>
<p>I'm all worked up now.</p>
<p>I feel bad.</p>
<p>I feel like maybe I should have some more wine in a can.</p>
<p>I'll get you one. I can use some canned wine to calm down a little bit.</p>
<p>Oh, you guys are drinking wine out of those cans?</p>
<p>Oh, you guys are drinking wine out of those cans?</p>
<p>Hell, yeah, baby.</p>
<p>Hell, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I have one? Yes, and you will notice the advantages almost immediately.</p>
<p>Here. Try this.</p>
<p>I feel like drinking wine out of a can... is conducive to my violent hand gestures when I speak.</p>
<p>You tend to be very emphatic and strong and- There's no spillage.</p>
<p>Say I wanna give one to Frank.</p>
<p>You didn't get any on me.</p>
<p>I spilled a little.</p>
<p>You wanna point accusatorily, but...</p>
<p>But it really boosts your mobility.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Excuse- Excuse me.</p>
<p>People, I- I'm sorry, but how do you guys wanna proceed from here?</p>
<p>Because I'm a little confused.</p>
<p>Ohh!</p>
<p>Did you wanna-</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>Um- Well, I guess we kind of got what we needed out of the intervention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right? So good job.</p>
<p>Was it? Did she?</p>
<p>We did all the work, didn't we?</p>
<p>So we can't really pay you 'cause of that.</p>
<p>I know we said we would, but we won't. Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, how about a can of wine?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>[Scoffs] No.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>All right. Well...</p>
<p>Okay, well, on your way.</p>
<p>Adios.</p>
<p>On your way then.</p>
<p>Take your jacket.</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Take that shoulder-padded jacket and get the hell out.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
<p>Don't expect a check in the mail.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Up top!</p>
<p>Up top, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Great intervention!</p>
<p>Great intervention!</p>
<p>Great intervention work!</p>
