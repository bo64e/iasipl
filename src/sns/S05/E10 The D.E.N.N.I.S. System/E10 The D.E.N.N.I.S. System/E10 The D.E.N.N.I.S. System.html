<p><strong>Mac</strong>: So, how many restraining orders does the waitress have on you?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: A lot, dude.</p>
<p>She's been irritated with me.</p>
<p>"You got me fired from the Oldies Rock Café. Guys.</p>
<p>You're gonna get me fired from the coffee shop.</p>
<p>" This is incredible.</p>
<p>Listen to this message. Come here.</p>
<p>This chick is so in love with me, it's crazy.</p>
<p>[On Phone]</p>
<p>Hi, Dennis, it's Caylee.</p>
<p>I was just calling to let you know that I hope you die!</p>
<p>You are obviously a terrible person with no regard for anyone but yourself!</p>
<p>I never, ever want to see you again, you steaming pile of horseshit!</p>
<p>Go to hell!</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>Whoa, that's amazing. That's the best one yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a really good one.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She hates your guts.</p>
<p>Dee, this chick is so in love with me, she doesn't even know it.</p>
<p>They don't get it because you haven't explained it to them, bro.</p>
<p>Oh, guys, I have a system, a foolproof system... for getting any chick's undying love and devotion for life.</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about, dude?</p>
<p>I'm talking about the D.E.N.N.I.S. System.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the D.E.N.N.I.S. System... is a comprehensive approach to seduction that I have perfected over the years.</p>
<p>See, my success with women does not solely stem from my good looks and my charm.</p>
<p>There is a careful, systemic approach... that has allowed me to become the playboy that I am today.</p>
<p>A playboy?</p>
<p>Is that how you see yourself? - Yes.</p>
<p>He has banged a lot of chicks.</p>
<p>Just shut up, Dee. Shut up.</p>
<p>Now, the first step to any erotic conquest is to "D"- demonstrate your value.</p>
<p>In this most recent case my subject was Caylee, a cute pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I demonstrated my value to her by filling a prescription.</p>
<p>I told her, "It's for my grandmother.</p>
<p>She's quite ill."</p>
<p>Thus demonstrating my value as a loving grandson and an all-around great guy.</p>
<p>You're forging prescriptions now?</p>
<p>That's the easy part, Dee.</p>
<p>I would've gone in and bought a box of magnum condom, thus demonstrating that I have a monster dong.</p>
<p>Right. That comes of a little bit desperate, Frank.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to have a magnum condom peeking out of your wallet when you go to pay, that's a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Now let's move on.</p>
<p>Once you've demonstrated your value, you are going to want to ask her out.</p>
<p>Once you've asked her out, you move on to "E."</p>
<p>"Engage physically."</p>
<p>I personally try to engage the girl physically without ever going on the date, which to me is really just a waste of time and money.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I'll tell her I know this great little restaurant that doesn't take reservations.</p>
<p>That makes it sound cool, makes it sound exclusive.</p>
<p>And then when we get to the restaurant, the restaurant is closed, as, of course, it always is on Sundays.</p>
<p>So I'll feign surprise and say something along the lines of, "I guess we could grab a pizza and watch a movie at my place."</p>
<p>That's where I come in.</p>
<p>Oh, you're a part of this?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Mac has a very special place in my system.</p>
<p>Yeah. You see, I'm on the couch when they come in and ask to be alone.</p>
<p>Then I say- - I can't go in my room.</p>
<p>I found a black widow spider in there.</p>
<p>Dennis fires back that he wants some privacy so that they can get to know each other better.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: And then I say- - Oh.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we could eat the pizza on my bed... and watch the DVD in my room.</p>
<p>And once we're on my bed, it is game over.</p>
<p>I engage her physically and the sexual waltz begins.</p>
<p>Pizza's good.</p>
<p>You're the one that's good.</p>
<p>Smooth! Very- Very smooth stuff.</p>
<p>Very classy.</p>
<p>I'm learning a lot from you right now, dude.</p>
<p>Okay. Now, once you've had sex with a woman, she will naturally start to depend on you. Okay?</p>
<p>All women do this.</p>
<p>They certainly do.</p>
<p>You got that right. [Laughing]</p>
<p>sex with women!</p>
<p>Once you bang 'em, you know- Like that.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the first "N."</p>
<p>"Nurturing Dependence."</p>
<p>You're gonna want to nurture that dependence that she's feeling on you now, guys.</p>
<p>Have her car towed.</p>
<p>Or you can slash her tires.</p>
<p>Either way, make her depend on you for rides.</p>
<p>Or you can use my personal go-to, which is to create a fictional, angry neighbor who is threatening her... and tell her you'll take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hit up a pay phone so that she can't trace the calls back to you.</p>
<p>Give her a call and say something along the lines of...</p>
<p>[Sinister Voice] I'm watching you, you bitch.</p>
<p>You're gonna die tonight!</p>
<p>[Sobbing]</p>
<p>Oh, for Christ's sake!</p>
<p>You're a complete sociopath!</p>
<p>Don't interrupt. Okay?</p>
<p>Now, if you've completed all the other steps properly up to this point, she'll naturally want to take the relationship to the next level.</p>
<p>But you're not gonna do that.</p>
<p>You're gonna do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Pull back, guys. Pull back.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second "N," "Neglect Emotionally."</p>
<p>You stop taking her phone calls.</p>
<p>Cancel all your plans.</p>
<p>Maybe that fictional, angry neighbor that you've simulated comes back, and this time you're not around to cool him off.</p>
<p>[Rings] Hello?</p>
<p>[Sinister Voice]</p>
<p>Welcome to hell!</p>
<p>[Sinister Laughing]</p>
<p>[Sinister Laughing]</p>
<p>This will frighten the shit out of her.</p>
<p>Okay? And she'll start getting really mixed up because you're not there to protect her.</p>
<p>She'll start questioning her self-worth, start questioning her- her self-esteem.</p>
<p>And that's the perfect time to "I"...</p>
<p>"Inspire Hope."</p>
<p>In Caylee's case, I went to her window and I screamed...</p>
<p>Caylee, listen.</p>
<p>Listen. Wait.</p>
<p>I want to tell you that the reason I was distant is because...</p>
<p>I was afraid that you were gonna break my heart... and I got scared.</p>
<p>But I'm not scared anymore, baby.</p>
<p>I love you. I need you.</p>
<p>And then, naturally, we bang.</p>
<p>♪♪ [Slow Pop]</p>
<p>♪ Watchin' every motion in my foolish lover's gaze ♪♪.</p>
<p>And this is the best bang of all because it's very emotional for her.</p>
<p>You see, she thinks she's broken through my tough exterior... and coerced affection from a man who is afraid to love.</p>
<p>And then I slink out into the night, never to talk to her again.</p>
<p>"Separate Entirely."</p>
<p>Yes, Mac.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I "S"...</p>
<p>"Separate Entirely."</p>
<p>D-E-N-N-I-S.</p>
<p>The D.E.N.N.I.S. System.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is the key to winning any girl's heart.</p>
<p>Yeah! All right!</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p>Better than I remember it.</p>
<p>Oh, good!</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>You are not winning their hearts.</p>
<p>You're torturing them and they end up hating you.</p>
<p>Actually, Dee, they end up loving me more than they ever thought was possible.</p>
<p>And you set it up so you can get these chicks back at any time?</p>
<p>That's exactly right, Charlie.</p>
<p>You're really picking up on this. I'm proud of you, bud.</p>
<p>There is no way that girl is gonna come back to you after what you just put her through.</p>
<p>I could absolutely get that girl back anytime I want. I just choose not to.</p>
<p>I 100% guarantee you this girl's finished with you.</p>
<p>Well, I take that as a challenge, Dee, and I accept that challenge.</p>
<p>I'll have her back by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Yeah. Dee, you don't get it.</p>
<p>This is what men do!</p>
<p>This is what men do! Yeah!</p>
<p>This is man stuff, Dee!</p>
<p>Man stuff!</p>
<p>Whee!</p>
<p>Man stuff!</p>
<p>[Laughing, Hooting]</p>
<p>[Growling]</p>
<p>This is what men-</p>
<p>Yee-hoo!</p>
<p>Aah-aah-aah!</p>
<p>You're probably getting D.E.N.N.I.S.</p>
<p>'d right now by that new boyfriend of yours, and you don't even know it.</p>
<p>What boyfriend? She don't have a boyfriend!</p>
<p>Yes, I do! Ben.</p>
<p>You know, the online soldier that I met.</p>
<p>We're back together now.</p>
<p>What? That dude wouldn't date you after what you put him through!</p>
<p>Maybe he'd D.E.N.N.I.S. you, but he wouldn't date you.</p>
<p>He's not D.E.N.N.I.S.-ing me!</p>
<p>He's in the car right now.</p>
<p>I told him to wait for me.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>So, wait. Your guy has been waiting out here the whole time in the hot sun?</p>
<p>Yeah. I told him to wait for me.</p>
<p>He kinda does whatever I say. It's pretty great.</p>
<p>Why'd you tell him to do it with the windows up?</p>
<p>That's cruel. The engine's not even on.</p>
<p>I didn't. I just didn't tell him to do it with the windows down. He's not the smartest, but...</p>
<p>Dee, it's, like, 100 degrees outside.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that he has engaged you physically?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, of course we've engaged physically.</p>
<p>Look at that body.</p>
<p>It is stupid.</p>
<p>Of course we've engaged over and over physically.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean that he's pulling some sort of a system.</p>
<p>Hey, guys! Hey- Hey, Dee!</p>
<p>I didn't see you there. Are you almost done?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I got caught up in a story.</p>
<p>But I'll be done pretty soon.</p>
<p>O-O-Okay. Well, do you want me to come in?</p>
<p>No. No, I don't. No.</p>
<p>You just- You just stay where you are.</p>
<p>You know what? I'll text you when I'm wrapping up.</p>
<p>Then you can crank the A.C.</p>
<p>, cool the car off for me. Okay. Sure thing.</p>
<p>See you, fellas. Okay.</p>
<p>Good. See you, man.</p>
<p>Dee, you're getting played.</p>
<p>You're getting played big time.</p>
<p>He's not doing anything.</p>
<p>Big time!</p>
<p>He's just- I told him to sit...</p>
<p>[Sighs]</p>
<p>And there you go. Good to see you.</p>
<p>See you soon. Bye.</p>
<p>Hey, Caylee.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Listen, before you say anything, I just want to say that I'm really sorry for everything that went down between us.</p>
<p>It's all my fault.</p>
<p>Nana took a turn for the worse, [Voice Cracking] and it's got me in a really bad place.</p>
<p>I just...</p>
<p>I don't know what I would do if she died.</p>
<p>I don't think your grandmother exists, Dennis.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I looked into it. There's no, um, Dr.</p>
<p>Toboggan in Philadelphia either.</p>
<p>Oh. No- Yeah, he doesn't-</p>
<p>He's not based in Philly.</p>
<p>Oh, no?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it says Philadelphia right there.</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah- No, that...</p>
<p>I'm gonna call him because if he's still giving people prescriptions on that pad, those people could get in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Oh! Whoa!</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm swooping in on your chick.</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S.</p>
<p>This chick so I can shove it in Dee's face.</p>
<p>What is this "swooping in" business?</p>
<p>Oh, that's my system. The M.A.C.</p>
<p>"Move-in After Completion."</p>
<p>I wait till you're done with them.</p>
<p>Then I swoop in, give them shoulder to cry on, and then we hump.</p>
<p>You been humping these girls after I'm done with them? Oh, yeah, dude.</p>
<p>I come in as the sensitive, intellectual type.</p>
<p>Why do you think I'm always reading books and shit when we do the spider routine?</p>
<p>I thought you were just my wing man though. No. No.</p>
<p>I'm swimming in your wake.</p>
<p>What are you two dickheads doing here?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm here for the scraps. - I haven't had a chance to get in there yet, okay? So just...</p>
<p>What's taking you so long?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait! You have a system where you come in after Mac?</p>
<p>That's right. I come in after Mac.</p>
<p>But he's taking forever this time.</p>
<p>I got my magnum condom.</p>
<p>I got my wad of hundreds. I'm ready to plow.</p>
<p>You should see him feast.</p>
<p>He's like a mantis. It's amazing.</p>
<p>Oh, that's good.</p>
<p>Call me that from now on.</p>
<p>Mantis.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Nobody's calling you Man-</p>
<p>Look, you guys gotta back off, okay?</p>
<p>I'm trying to re-D.E.N.N.I.S.</p>
<p>This chick. No, you back off!</p>
<p>Wait a second, Frank. He's right.</p>
<p>It's a delicate ecosystem.</p>
<p>We gotta stick with it.</p>
<p>Just let him do his thing.</p>
<p>Then we'll come in for seconds and scraps. Back off.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>

<p>Just play it cool.</p>
<p>Before she sees you.</p>
<p>Hurry up, though, because...</p>
<p>Magnum condom and a wad of hundreds.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>This is so exciting.</p>
<p>You're gonna love this.</p>
<p>Okay, just stop right there. Okay.</p>
<p>And off with the-</p>
<p>Okay, here we are!</p>
<p>I set up a picnic for us!</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>What- I- I set up a picnic.</p>
<p>Do you not like picnics?</p>
<p>Okay. All right. I know what's going on.</p>
<p>I- I'm on to you, guy.</p>
<p>You bring me out here to some landfill in the middle of nowhere, you blindfold me so I have no idea where I am...</p>
<p>I'm gonna depend on you to get home!</p>
<p>Dee, do you want to go? Yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna go, but not with you!</p>
<p>I'll go all by myself.</p>
<p>I'll take the bus. Okay.</p>
<p>And I'll also take this. Thank you.</p>
<p>Here. Do you want a glass?</p>
<p>No! Stop it!</p>
<p>Do you need bus fare?</p>
<p>I don't need bus fare!</p>
<p>I'm not sure the bus comes out here anyway.</p>
<p>I'll walk then, okay?</p>
<p>Wh- In your heels? They're very nice.</p>
<p>Here, take my boots. - Stop it!</p>
<p>Stop trying to make me depend on you, okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine all by myself, buddy!</p>
<p>I'm doing just fine by myself.</p>
<p>[Screaming]</p>
<p>[Groaning]</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>[Gasping] I'm fine!</p>
<p>Well, just stay there.</p>
<p>I'm gonna come down to help.</p>
<p>Leave me alone!</p>
<p>I won't give you the satisfaction!</p>
<p>I'm fine!</p>
<p>I'm independent, and I don't need you! - Wait!</p>
<p>I don't need anybody!</p>
<p>[Grunting Continues]</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>[Rattling]</p>
<p>Oh, what the hell!</p>
<p>Oh, what the hell, Charlie!</p>
<p>Oh, hey! Look who's home!</p>
<p>Uh- Hang on a second. What you doing there?</p>
<p>I'm calling the police.</p>
<p>Oh, no! You don't have to call the police.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>I'm here just to fix your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Is that a bag of hair in your hand, Charlie?</p>
<p>Have you been breaking into my apartment and shoving hair in my sink?</p>
<p>Okay. Okay! Let's start over.</p>
<p>We're getting way of topic here.</p>
<p>I would like you to focus on the amount of value that I am demonstrating to you... by fixing your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Just get the hell out of my apartment.</p>
<p>Are you sure? 'Cause your garbage disposal's a mess. Pretty sure.</p>
<p>It's way worse than when I got here.</p>
<p>I think you should get out.</p>
<p>All right. I like this blouse you're wearing.</p>
<p>That's nice. Is that new?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It's modern, right?</p>
<p>This is my uniform that I have to wear for my other job, and it's ugly.</p>
<p>Well, no, it's not ugly.</p>
<p>It's just, you know- It's unique.</p>
<p>So what's this new job?</p>
<p>I work at the fair.</p>
<p>You're working at the fair!</p>
<p>Well, look at us, you know?</p>
<p>I'm a plumber. You're a fair worker.</p>
<p>They go well together, right?</p>
<p>Get out of my apartment.</p>
<p>Oh, all right.</p>
<p>I don't know. I did everything right, and I can't get past the letter "D," dude.</p>
<p>Well, what did you do exactly?</p>
<p>I broke into her place.</p>
<p>I ripped her sink apart.</p>
<p>I brought a bag of hair. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I come across looking like a total jerk.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Because nothing that you just described sounds correct.</p>
<p>These are totally the type of things you were talking about- slashing a girl's tires, doing scary voices.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about plumbing?</p>
<p>Uh... no.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just over my head, this system.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just stick to stalking.</p>
<p>Maybe that's my system. She got a job at the fair.</p>
<p>It could be fun to stalk around a fair.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ on the cross, you look like shit.</p>
<p>Yeah! That's 'cause I spent the night in the woods trying to demonstrate my independence!</p>
<p>Okay, clearly none of you have any idea how to run my system!</p>
<p>Goddamn- All right. I'm gonna get everybody what they want, including myself.</p>
<p>Let me just think for a second.</p>
<p>Let me just work something out here and then... we'll...</p>
<p>♪♪ [Orchestra: Carmen]</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: What's he doing?</p>
<p>Just shut up and let him work.</p>
<p>♪♪ [Stops]</p>
<p>We're going to the fair.</p>
<p>Mmm!</p>
<p>[Charlie Laughs]</p>
<p>That will provide the perfect setting for all of our needs to be met.</p>
<p>You will demonstrate your value to the waitress by winning a prize at her booth.</p>
<p>Good, dude! Then I give her the prize and that's good!</p>
<p>No, that's dead wrong actually.</p>
<p>You're gonna take the prize and award it to the bustiest woman you can find. Okay?</p>
<p>Your indifference to the waitress will only make you more attractive to her.</p>
<p>Now, Dee, because of your ridiculous missteps, you actually have no value.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. So your only hope is to lower Ben's value.</p>
<p>You're gonna do this by flirting with a carney in front of him.</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, yeah, I don't know if I want to deal with a carney.</p>
<p>No one likes dealing with carneys, and that's why Frank will pose as one.</p>
<p>Now, Mac, you're the final piece in this puzzle.</p>
<p>I need you to resume your role as the thoughtful roommate and invite Caylee out to the fair.</p>
<p>There I shall be waiting to win back her heart.</p>
<p>How you gonna do that?</p>
<p>I gotta get myself a grandmother.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>What's happening is, we're at the fair, Gladys, and you're gonna act like my grandma, okay?</p>
<p>My grandmother had an affair with Susan B. Anthony.</p>
<p>I-I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>I'm paying you not to talk.</p>
<p>Well, hello!</p>
<p>This is a coincidence, huh?</p>
<p>No, it's not. No, it's not.</p>
<p>But it's exciting, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, what game do we have here?</p>
<p>What game is this?</p>
<p>Speed Pitch. That's all you do?</p>
<p>You throw a pitch?</p>
<p>I mean, what prizes are there?</p>
<p>There are no prizes, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's just to see "how fast can you throw." Oh!</p>
<p>Then I guess I'll demonstrate my value to you by firing off a wicked hot fastball, huh?</p>
<p>[Chuckles] You know this game is for children, right?</p>
<p>I don't care that it's for kids. All right?</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate my value to you. Please!</p>
<p>When I was little, all the kids would beat me up and call me Bookworm.</p>
<p>Right this way, Nana.</p>
<p>Kids are so brutal.</p>
<p>Oh. Hi, Mac, Caylee.</p>
<p>I didn't see you there.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>This is my nana.</p>
<p>She's on the mend, so I wanted to get her out of the house.</p>
<p>This is your grandmother? - Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>This is Nana. Yeah. Isn't she precious?</p>
<p>My grandmother was a lesbian.</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>How does it look?</p>
<p>It's great.</p>
<p>You look like a lizard.</p>
<p>I like turtles.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ooh, look! A carney!</p>
<p>♪♪ [Humming] Ooh! Eh. Frank!</p>
<p>Hey, Frank! What are you doing?</p>
<p>Lose the tie. You're way overdressed.</p>
<p>I got a new angle.</p>
<p>What? [Caylee] No, Dennis, this does not change...</p>
<p>Leave us alone. What? What?</p>
<p>Just listen to me for one second, okay?</p>
<p>Dennis, I've been looking all over for you.</p>
<p>Where you been?</p>
<p>Hello. Dr. Toboggan.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you. Hi.</p>
<p>Frank, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Actually, it's Mantis.</p>
<p>Mantis Toboggan, M.D.</p>
<p>I got your test results.</p>
<p>You're positive. You got the H.I.V.</p>
<p>Yes, AIDS. Big time!</p>
<p>What the hell you talking about?</p>
<p>Dennis, what- You got the AIDS big time!</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude?</p>
<p>Did you see her face? Look at her.</p>
<p>I'm breaking her down.</p>
<p>I'm making her feel worthless. You see?</p>
<p>She thinks she's got the H.</p>
<p>I.V. Then I slip in.</p>

<p>So, I wonder if there's a kissing booth anywhere close. [Bell Clanging]</p>
<p>[Computer Voice]</p>
<p>Sixty-four!</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>Ow, you stabbed me!</p>
<p>He stabbed me with a key!</p>
<p>Will someone- someone call a doctor! Ow!</p>
<p>You idiot! Why would you stab me?</p>
<p>I was flirting with you!</p>
<p>That guy paid me to.</p>
<p>You weren't supposed to stab her, man!</p>
<p>You were supposed to stab her!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You want to have me stabbed?</p>
<p>I was gonna protect you from the stabbing.</p>
<p>Wrong! Wrong!</p>
<p>Wrong! Wrong!</p>
<p>You're supposed to let her get stabbed, hope that it hits a main artery, and then as she's dying you nurse her back to health, thereby making her totally dependent on you! Ohh!</p>
<p>See, this is why nobody should be going off my system!</p>
<p>What do you mean, "Off your system?"</p>
<p>My system of seduction that I used to win your heart, that these idiots are ruining right now!</p>
<p>Ben's the only one who's using it properly.</p>
<p>Ben, explain the system.</p>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>You had your face painted like a goddamn frog person and you have no ulterior motive here?</p>
<p>I'm a lizard.</p>
<p>Oh, whoops! Oh!</p>
<p>I dropped my monster condom that I use for my magnum dong.</p>
<p>I'm out of here.</p>
<p>I'll give you a ride!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What? What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Dee, I don't like you.</p>
<p>Well, how is that possible?</p>
<p>You're a mean person.</p>
<p>[Stammers]</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You go! You get outta here!</p>
<p>Way to go, jerks! Good job!</p>
<p>Yeah? Way to go to you.</p>
<p>You work at a fair, carney!</p>
<p>Don't call her a carney, man.</p>
<p>I don't need you to take up for me!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>Shut up! Just go! Get outta here!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Idiots ruining my system.</p>
<p>Everybody ruins my system! Nobody gets it!</p>
<p>Oh, system, my ass.</p>
<p>I hate carnivals.</p>
<p>I need a ride.</p>
<p>Is there anybody out there that could take me home?</p>
