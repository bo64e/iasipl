<p>[Tool Clicking]</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: You gotta be careful of the wire, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I'm not gonna pinch the wire.</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>'Cause then the brake lights don't work.</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Make sure it's on tight.</p>
<p>It's on as tight as it's gonna get!</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>It's on good and tight.</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis, I think we should get, like, a G.P.S. System, 'cause these maps are from, like, the '70s, dude.</p>
<p>G.P.S. System? Oh, hell, no!</p>
<p>No? That's gonna ruin the road trip experience.</p>
<p>We gotta go do this old school, baby.</p>
<p>Maps, fresh cigarettes, fresh coffee, cooking out on the grill, sleeping in sleeping bags. Old school.</p>
<p>Old school, baby!</p>
<p>I'm into that!</p>
<p>Campfire.</p>
<p>Let's do old school!</p>
<p>Old school, yeah!</p>
<p>Oh, shit. [Horn Honks]</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Who is that? That Sweet Dee?</p>
<p>That's Dee.</p>
<p>That's Sweet Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it.</p>
<p>What is that car?</p>
<p>What is she doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What car is that?</p>
<p>Ah, shit. Okay, don't- don't-</p>
<p>Just don't say anything.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. What's with the trailer?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>None of your business.</p>
<p>What are you doing here so early?</p>
<p>Why are you at work early? - I woke up early this morning and went and bought a new car.</p>
<p>It's pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Where you guys going?</p>
<p>We're going to the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Frank!</p>
<p>Really? - Frank wants to see it before he dies, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened was he told us about a road trip. We got all excited.</p>
<p>We got up super early and we packed the car... and were hoping to get out of here before your bus arrived.</p>
<p>You were just gonna ditch me?</p>
<p>Nah, it's cool.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stick around.</p>
<p>Yeah. Charlie's too scared. Yeah.</p>
<p>He's never left Philly before.</p>
<p>I'm not scared!</p>
<p>I just haven't left Philly.</p>
<p>Why leave Philly, you know?</p>
<p>He's frightened.</p>
<p>I want to go.</p>
<p>No, you're not going.</p>
<p>You can't come 'cause it'll take forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you're gonna have to pee every five minutes. It's gonna be stupid.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna get stuck behind with Charlie.</p>
<p>Wait a second! If you go, I'm gonna be all by myself in the bar.</p>
<p>That's messed up, guys. I mean, that's more change than, like, even if I went.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe I should go.</p>
<p>Great. We're all in.</p>
<p>It's gonna be packed in the car!</p>
<p>No, we're not all in.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're going.</p>
<p>We're going on a road trip, baby!</p>
<p>Why did you have to buy a new car today of all days?</p>
<p>I'll go get my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I can't believe you've never been out of Philly, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. What the hell?</p>
<p>I've never done a lot of things.</p>
<p>What else have you not done, bro?</p>
<p>Uh, I've never eaten a pear.</p>
<p>What? How is that possible?</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Really? Pears weird me out, dude.</p>
<p>Where do you start with a pear?</p>
<p>The top, the bottom?</p>
<p>What do you mean, where do you start?</p>
<p>Just bite into it. It's a fruit.</p>
<p>You just start it.</p>
<p>Really? You just bite it?</p>
<p>It's a weird-looking thing.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>Pull over. I'm getting this kid a pear.</p>
<p>No, no. No pulling over!</p>
<p>We've got a schedule. Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>I would love to take a quick leak.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Oh, Deandra!</p>
<p>We just left!</p>
<p>That's what I was worried about.</p>
<p>And it can't just be any pear, dude.</p>
<p>It's gotta be a fresh one.</p>
<p>Let's go to the Italian market.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hey-oh! The Italian market is way out of our way.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Dennis, do you have to smoke?</p>
<p>It's coming right back in through my window.</p>
<p>Roll your window up then, Dee, 'cause I'm a-smoking.</p>
<p>The window needs to be down for the fresh air.</p>
<p>Hey, I've never had blueberries either. What?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>That's crazy!</p>
<p>That is completely insane.</p>
<p>We're definitely going to the Italian market.</p>
<p>Dennis, let's go.</p>
<p>You believe this guy? Jesus!</p>
<p>What guy?</p>
<p>Guy on the bike.</p>
<p>He's taking up the whole goddamn road.</p>
<p>Ride on the sidewalk if you're gonna ride a bike, asshole!</p>
<p>[Honking] What was that?</p>
<p>He flicked you off, dude.</p>
<p>Is that what that was?</p>
<p>He flicked you off, man.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Real chip on his shoulder, huh?</p>
<p>You wanna egg him?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna egg him.</p>
<p>You got eggs?</p>
<p>No. That would have been good though.</p>
<p>That would've been good, man.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm gonna fire a beer across his bow. Ruffle his feathers.</p>
<p>Yeah, give him a good scare?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah. Jerk.</p>
<p>Get up real close to him.</p>
<p>Hey, asshole.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>[All] Oh!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>I hit him! I hit him!</p>
<p>You hit him in the back of the head!</p>
<p>I didn't mean to.</p>
<p>That is not how I expected that to go at all. - Is he okay?</p>
<p>Did we kill him?</p>
<p>I don't know. Oh, he's getting up.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: He's moving, he's moving.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah, he's getting up.</p>
<p>Thank God, dude. God.</p>
<p>Should we help him out?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: And he's getting something out of his bag.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: What's he getting?</p>
<p>It's a pipe. It's a pipe?</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>[All Shouting At Once]</p>
<p>What's wrong with your tires?</p>
<p>The car's scraping.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right, get back to the bar.</p>
<p>Get back to the bar.</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>These tires are completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Ah, shit!</p>
<p>I'm just gonna pop inside real quick, take a quick squirt.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. How about we put a couple of doughnuts on there?</p>
<p>Oh, right, Frank. We're gonna go to the Grand Canyon on spare tires.</p>
<p>Uh, plus there's a good deal of mountain bike in your axle here, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Seriously, dude? Yeah.</p>
<p>We're talking structural damage down there.</p>
<p>There's leakage.</p>
<p>Things are sparking.</p>
<p>All right. Well, road trip's off.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Road trip's not off.</p>
<p>I have a good idea.</p>
<p>Not bad, right?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>It's kinda nice.</p>
<p>Lot of leg room.</p>
<p>It's a smooth ride.</p>
<p>You guys got a lot of room back there?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We got easy access to the beers too.</p>
<p>I mean, that's a good touch.</p>
<p>New car smell.</p>
<p>Mmm. How do you get that in a used car?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It's a spray.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a spray.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It's nice.</p>
<p>I enjoy it, man.</p>
<p>I'm glad that they did that. It's nice.</p>
<p>I wish that this light would hurry up and change.</p>
<p>That's the only thing. Uh-oh!</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, you bastards!</p>
<p>[All Groan]</p>
<p>You jerks! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Ah, here we go.</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>It's my car. I'm driving. Get out!</p>
<p>I got window!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You call window, Frank?</p>
<p>You jerks!</p>
<p>I got window.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: You guys are dicks.</p>
<p>It took you long enough.</p>
<p>You were taking forever!</p>
<p>Did you still want to go?</p>
<p>Shut up! It's really cramped back here with this cooler.</p>
<p>Why don't you put the cooler in the trailer?</p>
<p>Because then, Dee, we're gonna have to pull over every single time we want a beer.</p>
<p>That new car smell is starting to give me a headache.</p>
<p>Dennis, give me a cigarette.</p>
<p>You want a cigarette?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have one too.</p>
<p>Do you guys have to smoke in here?</p>
<p>Yeah- Well, your car reeks, Dee, so-</p>
<p>[Blows Raspberry]</p>
<p>God, dude, this thing is so heavy!</p>
<p>I'm gonna get a blood clot with this thing! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Why don't you put it in the trailer?</p>
<p>Why don't I put you in the trailer?</p>
<p>Good one, Charlie.</p>
<p>That's actually not a bad idea.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind riding back there.</p>
<p>There's a hell of a lot more room.</p>
<p>I'm done with that.</p>
<p>[Both Exclaim] <strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, come on!</p>
<p>Oh, it's in my- Get it!</p>
<p>You're gonna burn a hole in the new upholstery!</p>
<p>It's not new upholstery.</p>
<p>What makes you think it's new upholstery?</p>
<p>Did you get it?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>This sucks! Deandra, pull over.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>I wanna go in the back with Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You guys ride in back, and we'll- Yeah.</p>
<p>We'll go in the back.</p>
<p>Mmm. This is more like it, huh, Frank?</p>
<p>Got a lot of room back here.</p>
<p>It's muggy back here. Muggy.</p>
<p>My glands are starting to swell up.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, maybe we crack that door a little bit.</p>
<p>What? And go flying out at the first corner?</p>
<p>I don't think so, buddy.</p>
<p>Well, just to crack it- just a little bit.</p>
<p>You want to crack it?</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll crack it.</p>
<p>Crack it.</p>
<p>Whoa. It's hard to stand up back here.</p>
<p>Furniture is what we need.</p>
<p>We'll pick some up at the Italian market.</p>
<p>When's the last time you saw furniture in an Italian market?</p>
<p>Those people will sell you anything.</p>
<p>They'll sell you their children. They don't care.</p>
<p>Provolone and salami.</p>
<p>They sell everything at the Italian market.</p>
<p>These people are like descendants of Gypsies.</p>
<p>They come in. They sell their shit.</p>
<p>They bang each other.</p>
<p>I don't know what they do, but you get to haggle with them. It's a lot of fun.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'll prop this beer bottle under the door. - All right.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>[Groans] Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh-</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Perfect. Now, the weight of the door will keep the beer bottle in place.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Nice, huh? Move over a little bit.</p>
<p>Let me sit on the cooler.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>All right, now this I can get into.</p>
<p>You know? A little space back here.</p>
<p>You guys want to listen to some tunes?</p>
<p>Got some CDs from Dennis here.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but there's no CD player in here. Are you shitting me?</p>
<p>No. Why would you buy a car with no CD player?</p>
<p>Because the guy knocked 50 bucks off.</p>
<p>So you had the option?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had the option! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>And you went with the tape deck?</p>
<p>Yes, I did, Charlie!</p>
<p>That is so cheap, Dee!</p>
<p>You're cheap! Why did you buy this crappy little car in the first place?</p>
<p>Because you guys rammed my last one into a wall! That's why.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>What tapes do you have?</p>
<p>Tapes?</p>
<p>Who has tapes anymore?</p>
<p>I would've thought that you would've at least made a mix for the road trip.</p>
<p>You didn't invite me on your road trip!</p>
<p>You don't keep a good mix tape in your car?</p>
<p>I just bought the car this morning, Charlie!</p>
<p>Okay! All right!</p>
<p>Are you going to yell the whole way there, Dee? Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Just shut up and turn the radio on.</p>
<p>Yeah, put the radio on.</p>
<p>Just turn the radio on!</p>
<p>[Radio: Tuning]</p>

<p>The antenna is probably broken on this piece of shit car!</p>
<p>It's static. Find a station.</p>
<p>You're a piece of shit... car. Wait a second.</p>
<p>There's a tape right down here, I think.</p>
<p>You got a tape?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's under the seat.</p>
<p>Give it to me. Gimme.</p>
<p>It's jammed in the corner of the seat.</p>
<p>Give it to me.</p>
<p>I'm trying to give it- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, There we go. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme...</p>

<p>Oh, I don't have a bucket list, dude, 'cause I'm not dying.</p>
<p>Everybody's dying, bitch.</p>
<p>Let's get you some fruit.</p>
<p>Guys, we're gonna go grab some furniture to throw in the back.</p>
<p>Ten minutes. That's all.</p>
<p>And we meet back here.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. But get a good deal.</p>
<p>I mean, talk to the guy. Barter.</p>
<p>There's no rush, right?</p>
<p>Ten. Ten minutes.</p>
<p>Have fun, man. Have fun.</p>
<p>Uh, I've never had a strawberry either.</p>
<p>That's astounding.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, I'm excited for you, bro.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Pears.</p>
<p>Nice! Yes. One of nature's most delectable fruits.</p>
<p>Mmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>How much for this?</p>
<p>Those are 50 cents.</p>
<p>Well, I won't pay full price.</p>
<p>So I'll give you a dime.</p>
<p>They're 50 cents, buddy. Very well.</p>
<p>I'll drop you a quarter.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay. Thirty-five cents.</p>
<p>I don't have time for this friggin' shit.</p>
<p>Give me the 35.</p>
<p>Hey, yeah!</p>

<p>All right, Bozo. Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm calling a lot of people Bozo now.</p>
<p>It's like my new thing. Dude.</p>
<p>Chomp into it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Just bite it?</p>
<p>Okay. Like a piece of fruit.</p>
<p>You would bite into it...</p>

<p>Like sand?</p>
<p>Oh, that- that pear's not ripe, dude.</p>
<p>Ah. He burned us.</p>

<p>Excuse me, sir?</p>
<p>What are you doing to my friend, Bozo?</p>
<p>You burned us. It's dry.</p>
<p>You picked it out.</p>
<p>Well, let's not get into a whole "who picked out what.</p>
<p>" I want my 35 cents back.</p>
<p>Charlie, give him the pear.</p>
<p>I can't. I just ate it.</p>
<p>The whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah. It was pretty gross.</p>
<p>The stem and then- and the core?</p>
<p>You didn't tell me not to eat the stem, dude!</p>
<p>Did you eat the stickers that are all over it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was gross!</p>
<p>Of course it's gross!</p>
<p>It's a sticker, bro!</p>
<p>I eat stickers all the time, dude!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>This whole thing is a disaster.</p>

<p>They got a lot of good stuff here.</p>
<p>I like the rocking chair.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>But I do like those wicker chairs.</p>
<p>They might be more forgiving on my bottom.</p>
<p>Good. It's a tough decision though.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Well, make one, Den.</p>
<p>Make one, please. Make a decision?</p>
<p>Um, sir? Hi. We're interested in these wicker chairs, but we're totally unwilling to pay full price for them, so...</p>
<p>You're gonna barter with the guy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're not gonna barter with him.</p>
<p>We're not bartering. We'll pay full price.</p>
<p>Get the wicker chairs.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. Frank.</p>
<p>Come on. The Gypsy wants to barter.</p>
<p>Let's barter with him.</p>
<p>We don't have time to barter.</p>
<p>All right. We'll pay full price for...</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Is that a French press?</p>
<p>Sir, how much for that fine-looking French press?</p>
<p>We don't need a French press, Dennis.</p>
<p>What, do you expect me to drink gas station coffee all the way to the Grand Canyon?</p>
<p>I don't think so, asshole. Sir, the man will pay full price for the French press, or I will, however, be willing to barter with you for a very long time.</p>
<p>Full price.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Hey, you guys seen anybody selling cassette tapes?</p>
<p>Deandra, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you drinking?</p>
<p>It's an energy drink. You guys are drinking beer.</p>
<p>I gotta tweak on something.</p>
<p>You're gonna be pissing every 15 feet. Nah!</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I'm buying you a piss jar. Ooh!</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I think I see some tapes down there.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go barter with that guy.</p>
<p>Barter with the Gypsy.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm telling you, it's black to yellow.</p>
<p>And no one ever uses...</p>
<p>Black to yellow? No, dude. It's blue to something.</p>
<p>You never let me do this, okay?</p>
<p>And hurry up, man.</p>
<p>It's blue to something.</p>
<p>Just use the black to yellow, and the car will start. Oh, shit!</p>
<p>You guys, check it out.</p>
<p>I found this Soul Asylum tape, and I totally talked the guy down to, like, half the asking price.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Yeah. There was a bunch of wires hanging down, and I was trying to put them back up into- Shut up! Just shut up!</p>
<p>Here's your piss jar.</p>
<p>Yo, Frank, I'm gonna hop in the back with Dennis.</p>
<p>You want to switch with me?</p>
<p>Switch-ola? They're gonna argue the whole way.</p>
<p>I don't wanna listen to it.</p>
<p>No, I don't like it in there anyway.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, you want a cup of joe, my man?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, definitely, dude.</p>
<p>I got a pipin'-hot one ready for you right now.</p>
<p>Hook me up, bro.</p>
<p>Hook me up!</p>
<p>All right. [Laughs]</p>
<p>That's a pretty sweet duct tape rig you got going on the door, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You like that? Taped the chairs down too, so they don't slide any.</p>
<p>I know, but you stopped at the grill, and that's got me confused.</p>
<p>Ran out of tape actually. - Oh, right.</p>
<p>It's not gonna slide through the crack?</p>
<p>It won't because I measured the crack, and the crack is smaller than the height of the grill.</p>
<p>We are all hooked up here, dude.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Now, are you nervous at all about leaving Philly?</p>
<p>Like, is anything bad gonna happen?</p>
<p>[Chuckles] I don't think so, man.</p>
<p>I'm excited about it.</p>
<p>I've just never been outside of Philly.</p>
<p>I don't know what people are like.</p>
<p>Well, people are people.</p>
<p>Nobody's gonna be, like, a dick?</p>
<p>There are probably gonna be some dicks out there. Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>But I'll be there. I'll back you up, man.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks, man.</p>
<p>I tell you what will help. Shotgun a beer?</p>
<p>That'll calm my nerves.</p>
<p>It sure will.</p>

<p>What do you say we smash these wicker chairs to bits, put them in the middle of the U-Haul- which is metal... and we burn the wicker chairs and cook the hot dogs on that?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Cook the hot dogs over the fire?</p>
<p>And then we'll get some new wicker chairs next time we're at a Gypsy hangout spot.</p>
<p>Okay. You think we're gonna be going to a lot of those?</p>
<p>'Cause I feel like I already dodged a bullet once today. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, Gypsies- I don't want anyone shrinking my head and shit.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, it was not Gypsies ever that did that.</p>
<p>That's sort of a witch doctor thing.</p>
<p>But either way, neither one of them can shrink heads.</p>
<p>Let's burn the chairs. All right.</p>
<p>A couple hot dogs will calm me down.</p>
<p>Thanks for driving.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the ride.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>[Slurring] So you're headed to Hollywood, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You're running away from home, aren't you?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Kinda.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Sweet baby, they are gonna eat you alive in Hollywood.</p>
<p>[Gasps] Oh, you're definitely gonna end up doing gay porn... with this tiny little body of yours. No.</p>
<p>Oh, man, kid.</p>
<p>I'll be fine.</p>
<p>I've actually got an uncle out there that's...</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>I got something you need to hear about.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>

<p>Pull over, you little dick!</p>
<p>[Groans] Stop the car!</p>
<p>Piss!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Dee!</p>
<p>I'm covered in piss!</p>
<p>Well, maybe you shouldn't have had your window down!</p>
<p>Maybe you shouldn't be throwing jars of pee out the window!</p>
<p>Maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.</p>
<p>It's up for debate. You shouldn't!</p>
<p>Hey, what the hell is that?</p>
<p>[Mac Coughs, Spits] Oh!</p>
<p>Oh! Oh.</p>
<p>[Coughing]</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Damn. It's dark, and we haven't even left Philly yet. [Coughing]</p>
<p>I'm so sorry, dude.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened, man.</p>
<p>It's like, we lit the chairs, and there must've been a glaze on the wicker or something.</p>
<p>Yeah. 'Cause, like, we passed out instantly.</p>
<p>Some sort of a poison glaze.</p>
<p>What are we, 20 minutes away from the bar?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're close.</p>
<p>I use this gas station all the time.</p>
<p>Sorry. Took a little longer than I thought.</p>
<p>There was a line for the bathroom.</p>
<p>Hey-oh! Check out this couch I found by the Dumpster.</p>
<p>Toss it in. Nice.</p>
<p>Got it, buddy.</p>
<p>Wait. What's the plan here?</p>
<p>You guys are still gonna ride in the back?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I sure as shit am, dude.</p>
<p>You're not gonna get the smell of piss out of that car for weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty bad.</p>
<p>I'm in. Me too.</p>
<p>You guys getting in too?</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>All right, whatever.</p>
<p>[Coughing]</p>
<p>Have fun in the death trap!</p>
<p>I guess I'm riding with you, bro.</p>
<p>Hey, you're not gonna sing to me, are you?</p>
<p>I might.</p>
<p>[Sighs] All right.</p>
<p>Hey, you know, Dee, I didn't want to say anything back there, 'cause I didn't want to be rude to the kid, but you really gotta be careful just picking up hitchhikers.</p>
<p>I know. But that kid was, like, really young and sweet and innocent-looking.</p>
<p>Right. But those are the ones you gotta watch out for.</p>
<p>Those are the most dangerous hitchhikers... the ones that lure you into thinking they're sane by acting like normal people.</p>
<p>They act like they're normal and then they carve you up.</p>
<p>No way. Wasn't gonna happen.</p>
<p>I had my eyes on him the whole time.</p>
<p>See, I've always got an "A,"</p>
<p>"B" and a "C" strike plan... to get us out of any potentially life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>Yeah. He probably just carved up his mother and father, and he's running away on the road.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Could be, Frank. All I'm saying is that I'm ready for any situation.</p>
<p>And that's why you're all safe as long as I'm around. - Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Yeah. I did an ocular pat-down and I cleared him.</p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>I'm saying that I did an ocular assessment of the situation, garnered that he was not a security risk, and I cleared him for passage.</p>
<p>[Chuckling]</p>
<p>"Ocular pat-down"!</p>
<p>What in the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I'm talking about breaking down the security situation, clearing an individual and making it safe for passage.</p>
<p>Well, how exactly do you view yourself within the context of our group?</p>
<p>The sheriff of Paddy's.</p>
<p>Well, I can't have this conversation right now.</p>
<p>The sheriff of Paddy's?</p>
<p>Can you move?</p>
<p>I want to unfold this thing.</p>
<p>I'm gonna pass out.</p>
<p>Got a long trip ahead of us.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I got it.</p>

<p>[Grumbles]</p>
<p>Aah! Aah!</p>
<p>Get off me, dude!</p>
<p>Are we moving?</p>
<p>I think we're stopped.</p>
<p>Dee, what time is it? What?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.?</p>
<p>shit, we've been driving all night.</p>
<p>We're not moving, are we?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Whoa. shit.</p>
<p>You think we're, like, halfway there?</p>
<p>Where do you think we are?</p>
<p>I wonder how far we got.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I wonder if we're like...</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>[Frank Groans]</p>
<p>Oh, are we back at Paddy's?</p>
<p>Wait. Where the hell is my car?</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn!</p>
<p>shit balls!</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>[Gasps]</p>
<p>[Yawns] Hey, you guys are back!</p>
<p>How was the Grand Canyon?</p>
<p>What the hell happened to my car, Charlie?</p>
<p>I don't know. Last thing I remember, uh, we were at the gas station.</p>
<p>And then you guys hopped in back, and I hopped in front with the hitchhiker.</p>
<p>Then I got freaked out about leaving Philly, so I asked him if he'd drop me off back here.</p>
<p>And he said he'd take you guys to the Grand Canyon, and then I drank all night and passed out.</p>
<p>And then you guys were getting here now, so I figured- Did you go and come back?</p>
<p>He didn't take us to the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>He detached the trailer and stole my car!</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Mac had already cleared him as a security risk.</p>
<p>Did an ocular pat-down on him.</p>
<p>Amazing, right?</p>
<p>You cleared him, Mac?</p>
<p>I cleared him.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>I thought he was clear!</p>
<p>He wasn't clear! I'm calling the cops.</p>
<p>He was clear.</p>
<p>I thought Mac cleared him.</p>
<p>I didn't think there'd be a problem.</p>
<p>I don't know how- I kinda had a good time on the trip.</p>
<p>Looking on the bright side of things. All right?</p>
<p>Let's drink some beers, man.</p>
<p>I'm hungover as shit. Absolutely, man.</p>
<p>Little hair of the dog. - That was the closest I ever got to being out of Philly, man.</p>
<p>All right, cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers, you guys.</p>
