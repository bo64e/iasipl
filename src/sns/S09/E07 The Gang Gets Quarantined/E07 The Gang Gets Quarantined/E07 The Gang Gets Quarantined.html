<p>God, guys, damn it.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I need a little... (sighs) a little buoyancy in the harmonies.</p>
<p>I mean, listen to the lyrics.</p>
<p>Right? "Not too hard... not too soft."</p>
<p>You were coming in pretty hard, I would say.</p>
<p>The lead's got to cut through, Dee.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I don't know, man.</p>
<p>I thought we sounded pretty good.</p>
<p>Oh, we sounded "pretty good."</p>
<p>Oh, hi, super group Boyz II Men, please let us win your contest.</p>
<p>We sound, eh, pretty good.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>If we're gonna open for Boyz II Men at the Boyz II Men concert, we need to dazzle them with our harmonies.</p>

<p>That sweet old man from our building.</p>
<p>This is the worst flu that Philly has ever seen.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>We have to quarantine ourselves.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Frank, we're not gonna die of the flu because we're young and vital.</p>
<p>You are old and feeble.</p>
<p>Actually, Frank does bring up a good point.</p>
<p>We can't afford to get sick right now.</p>
<p>'Cause you know what you can't do when you get the flu?</p>
<p>Sing?</p>
<p>Sing.</p>
<p>Sing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I was gonna...</p>
<p>You wanted to say it?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wanted to say it.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, well, I'm sorry, man.</p>
<p>Uh, do you want to ask it again, or...?</p>
<p>Ask us again.</p>
<p>Uh, you know what you can't do when you get...?</p>
<p>Nah, forget it, it's fine.</p>
<p>Quarantine, baby!</p>
<p>All right, this is gonna be good.</p>
<p>Everybody find a spot to put your sleeping bags and we'll be all set.</p>
<p>All right, Frank, where we at, my man?</p>
<p>Well, right there.</p>
<p>You know, you don't have to sleep together.</p>
<p>It's a comfort thing.</p>
<p>Guys, I got to say, I'm excited to play quarantine.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, for the last time, we're not playing quarantine, this is a quarantine.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm gonna get so blacked out.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Mac, do you want to lose this singing contest?</p>
<p>Why do you think we're quarantining ourselves in the first place?</p>
<p>To protect my life!</p>
<p>No, to preserve our vocal cords, okay?</p>
<p>Which also means no alcohol, guys.</p>
<p>Come on, dude!</p>
<p>That's crazy.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's a good idea.</p>
<p>Because alcohol lowers your immune system.</p>
<p>Well, why the hell are we quarantining ourselves in a bar, if we can't drink?</p>
<p>We got to drink.</p>
<p>Yes, hi, I'd like to order two pepperonis, one combo and breadsticks, like, a shitload of breadsticks...</p>

<p>You can't do that.</p>

<p>You lost your privileges.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Dee.</p>
<p>It's just until the vaccine is replenished.</p>
<p>He does make a good point, you know?</p>
<p>Vaccines really do work.</p>
<p>My mom used to vaccinate me, like, every month, and I never got sick.</p>
<p>The reason you didn't get sick was because you and your mom would wear those ridiculous bubble boy suits during the flu season.</p>
<p>Okay, what are we gonna do in here if we can't eat pizza or drink beer?</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Practice.</p>

<p>Ah, calm down.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, I think we're focusing a little too much on the singing and not enough on the showmanship.</p>
<p>You know, maybe we should work out a couple of sweet dance moves, you know?</p>
<p>What is that? Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, that we could all do in unison.</p>
<p>Or maybe we could wear the same outfit!</p>
<p>Okay, yes!</p>

<p>Oh, you guys, you guys, if we want to stand out, you know what we got to do?</p>
<p>We got to focus on our story.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Those competitions are all about how singing helped you overcome some major obstacle, you know?</p>
<p>So I'll do, like, a stutter, and I'll say I got it from-from watching, like, a friend get blown to bits in Iraq.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, you know what?</p>
<p>And do it with a Southern accent and talk about Jesus a lot.</p>

<p>Good, good, okay, so we'll be, like, a group of, like, Southern, stuttering army vets with, like, a religious bend.</p>

<p>Okay, and then we'll all be in the same outfit.</p>
<p>Oh, we should be, like, carnies.</p>

<p>I thought we were just playing quarantine.</p>
<p>What the...?!</p>
<p>No, we're not playing quarantine.</p>
<p>We're quarantined.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
