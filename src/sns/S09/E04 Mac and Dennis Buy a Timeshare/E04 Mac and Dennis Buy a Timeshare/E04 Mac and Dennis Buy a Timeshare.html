<p><strong>Dee</strong>: So sign up for the Invigaron system today, and take the first steps toward obtaining financial freedom.</p>
<p>Invigaron-- a business opportunity as rare as the albani berries themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What's happening?</p>
<p>You're, like, a berry salesman now or...?</p>
<p>No, I'm a distributor, Charlie, for a revolutionary new product that changes lives.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Right. Now explain these to me. Oh, those are my new wrenches.</p>
<p>I got those free for sitting through a 20-minute presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, I get it now.</p>
<p>It's a scam.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, it's not a scam at all.</p>
<p>I also had reservations in the beginning, but these super berries grow in the Andes mountains, okay?</p>
<p>Alpacas can survive entire winters on this shit.</p>
<p>Oh, shit! So it's like a super berry, huh?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Now what kind of superpowers are you talking about? Like, do you survive the winter? Great question.</p>
<p>So is that the only super power you get, surviving winters?</p>
<p>Because I've survived many winters without these berries.</p>
<p>No, I think I have an answer for all of this stuff, okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Charlie, allow me to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Oh, you got a thing here.</p>
<p>Come over here and hold on to these.</p>
<p>Now, this machine is gonna measure the level of toxins in your body caused by stress.</p>
<p>All right. Where do I put my feet?</p>
<p>Wherever you want.</p>
<p>I'm gonna put them on the stool.</p>
<p>Great. It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>120, 140, 157.</p>
<p>(machine beeping)</p>
<p>Oh, shit, Charlie. 157?</p>
<p>Is that bad?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not good.</p>
<p>Guys, I got 157.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>157 what?</p>
<p>Units.</p>
<p>Units, dude.</p>
<p>Units of what?</p>
<p>Units of stress!</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>You're very, very high in your...</p>
<p>That's a lot of units!</p>
<p>...in your stress unit.</p>
<p>But don't even worry, because Invigaron can help you.</p>
<p>These berries are chock-full of antioxidants and phytonutrients.</p>
<p>Oh, thank God.</p>
<p>All right, I'm sold. I'm in.</p>
<p>Of course you're buying it, because you're as big of an idiot as she is.</p>
<p>You're getting scammed, Dee!</p>
<p>It's not a scam!</p>
<p>You walked into a room that you could have walked out of with a free set of golf club but instead you got got.</p>
<p>Hey, I say we get ourselves a new pair of golf clubs, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we won't get got though.</p>
<p>We gonna get. See, Dee, people like us, we don't get got. We go get.</p>
<p>That's right. You won't see us getting scammed.</p>
<p>No way. (laughs)</p>
<p>Hey-oh! All right, Charlie, I signed you up for the gold member starter kit, okay?</p>
<p>Good. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know what's in here?</p>
<p>Two cases of the juice, four packs of the energy gel.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>There's a box of shake mix, and I think they threw in a bunch of protein...</p>
<p>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!</p>
<p>What are you doing, Charlie?!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>I'm drinking the berry juice to save my life.</p>
<p>This is not about berries, all right?</p>
<p>You sell it. This is a whole moneymaking system, okay?</p>
<p>That's what Invigaron is.</p>
<p>It's-it's about money, and it's about, you know, "wealth creation through-through the use of antioxidants, powerful antioxidants."</p>
<p>Yeah, uh-huh.</p>
<p>And, you know, we're going to "redefine success and-and change the world."</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>All those words are, like, stressing me out, Dee.</p>
<p>And I can't get more str...</p>
<p>I'm at 157!</p>
<p>I'm gonna be honest.</p>
<p>I'm a little confused as well.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't have a firm grasp on exactly how this...</p>
<p>It's confusing stuff.</p>
<p>Where the hell is Frank?</p>
<p>Where the hell is Frank?</p>
<p>He can help us.</p>
<p>He's, like, a business genius.</p>
<p>I don't know where he is.</p>
<p>He didn't come home this morning.</p>
<p>He took off last night.</p>
<p>He said he had some dream or something.</p>
<p>And, like, he woke up, he's like, "Ah, Charlie, I got to get to the playground."</p>
<p>And he shot out of here.</p>
<p>Why is he at the playground?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>He told me not to come.</p>
<p>Well, we got to go figure it out.</p>
<p>He can help explain all this.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's good with stuff like this.</p>
<p>We're not.</p>
<p>All right, all right, let's do it.</p>
<p>I'm drinking this one though.</p>
<p>Yeah, but don't open any more.</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What is this? You're stuck?</p>
<p>Was this your plan?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>How does anything happen, Charlie?</p>
<p>Move past it, will ya?</p>
<p>I'm afraid that's going to be impossible.</p>
<p>Yeah. Where are your clothes?</p>
<p>Why are you naked and stuck in a coil?</p>
<p>Just get me out of here.</p>
<p>All right, well, first we should do the thing because..</p>
<p>Yeah. Charlie and I have a couple of business questions we wanted to ask you first.</p>
<p>What? Deandra, don't dick around.</p>
<p>Get me out of here!</p>
<p>Look, I'll be quick, okay?</p>
<p>Now, Charlie and I have recently come into a rare business opportunity, and we were hoping you could clear a couple things up for us.</p>
<p>Can you look at that?</p>
<p>It's a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>It's not a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>It's a reverse funnel system.</p>
<p>Turn it upside down.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! shit!</p>
<p>All right, you've been duped, suckers.</p>
<p>You're the sucker, okay?</p>
<p>You're naked and you're stuck in a coil! All right, calm down, calm down.</p>
<p>Look, Frank is there any way, you know, to get out of one of these schemes?</p>
<p>All right, what you got to do is round up a couple of suckers and get 'em hooked.</p>
<p>Dummies with deep pockets are the best.</p>
<p>What about Ben the Soldier?</p>
<p>Well, he's as dumb as you can get.</p>
<p>Yeah. He's dumb as bricks, that guy.</p>
<p>He's so stupid.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>We'll get him, and I'll get, like, a pulley or a rope, and we'll just yank you out of there or something, all right?</p>
<p>Get me out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>Charlie, whoa, think about this.</p>
<p>If we get him out of there, how do we know he's gonna keep helping us?</p>
<p>Well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>If we get him out of there, he might scam us further.</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>He's a business mastermind.</p>
<p>I don't know what he's got going on.</p>
<p>shit, that's a good point.</p>
<p>I mean, what's he doing in that coil, you know what I mean? He wouldn't say.</p>
<p>He could be up to something.</p>
<p>I say we leave him stuck in there just for a few more days so we can leverage him for business advice...</p>
<p>Right. We keep him contained.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>If we need questions, we just go to him.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, Frank, we'll be back in a couple days to help you out, okay, buddy?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Deandra, I don't have a couple of days!</p>
<p>It's Saturday coming up.</p>
<p>There's gonna be kids here!</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>You here for the presentation?</p>
<p>I'm Harris Marder.</p>
<p>Save it, bozo.</p>
<p>We're here for the free golf clubs.</p>
<p>You got exactly 20 minutes to do your little song and dance.</p>
<p>We're just gonna tune out, so why don't you give us a wave when you're finished.</p>
<p>Or don't.</p>
<p>What's the point?</p>
<p>I'd just be wasting my time.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, you two are smart. 19 minutes and 50 seconds, clown. Don't get me wrong.</p>
<p>Invigaron is great, but you got to put in the hours.</p>
<p>You fellows strike me more as men of leisure.</p>
<p>(Dennis scoffs)</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>Well, we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this guy's got the Hawaiian shirt, you with the killer tan.</p>
<p>Bet it's killing you guys to be stuck indoors on a beautiful day like today.</p>
<p>It is. So less yapping, more golf clubs please.</p>
<p>(Dennis chuckles)</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Because you guys are such great sports, I'm gonna throw in a coupon for a free round of golf at the Dusty Dunes Resort in Orlando.</p>
<p>You guys been to Florida?</p>
<p>Been there? Not physically.</p>
<p>If you want, I can set you up with one of their private villas.</p>
<p>(scoffs): Private villa.</p>
<p>Whatever. That's pretty nice.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Oh, it is nice.</p>
<p>Did you know that the average rate for a hotel room 30 years ago was $19?</p>
<p>Today it's $237.</p>
<p>That's a 1,300% increase.</p>
<p>So it's not inconceivable to think that in another 30 years, a week at a hotel runs you 20 grand.</p>
<p>That's not inconceivable.</p>
<p>That's... crazy. That's very, very conceivable. Really?</p>
<p>Okay, but not for you guys.</p>
<p>You'll be locked in at $1,400 annually.</p>
<p>Wait. We would be?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm not talking about taking a vacation, guys.</p>
<p>I'm talking about owning a vacation.</p>
<p>And, look, if you're still not comfortable with the numbers, you just double down.</p>
<p>You get two weeks, sell that second week, boom, you're vacationing for free.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Mac, I think this guy just bent himself over a barrel a little bit.</p>
<p>He did?</p>
<p>Yeah, for our pleasure.</p>
<p>Follow me here.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we buy a second week, and we sell that, we're vacationing for free.</p>
<p>What happens if we buy a third week and sell that?</p>
<p>We're getting paid to vacation!</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>You guys, I... I've actually never thought of it like that.</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>I'm not sure I can make that deal.</p>
<p>The deal's locked in.</p>
<p>Deal's done.</p>
<p>I'm gonna write in "three..."</p>
<p>Write in "three weeks."</p>
<p>Three here... that's done!</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Put three on...</p>
<p>You got got!</p>
<p>You thought we were a bunch of suckers, but guess what?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>We're not.</p>
<p>We just bought three weeks of a time-share. (laughing)</p>
<p>So you did.</p>
<p>Not a great turnout.</p>
<p>No, not-not a great turnout.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit about free soup, Charlie.</p>
<p>People want golf clubs and concert tickets.</p>
<p>Don't knock the soup, all right? Da'Maniac's here.</p>
<p>He's sucked down, like, three bowls of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, he is here.</p>
<p>And why is he here, Charlie?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Nobody wants to buy something from a deranged wrestler.</p>
<p>Why would you invite him?</p>
<p>I didn't invite him.</p>
<p>He just drifted in.</p>
<p>I guess he was...</p>
<p>Just looking for soup.</p>
<p>...looking for free soup, yeah, free soup.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You know, drifters...</p>
<p>All right, let's just get it going, all right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming today.</p>
<p>Each one of you has been hand-selected to potentially join our Invigaron team.</p>
<p>"What is Invigaron?" you may be asking.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>(doorbell rings)</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I'm Dee, and this is Charlie.</p>
<p>And as you can tell by our huge mansion, we're insanely loaded. But it wasn't always this way.</p>
<p>We used to be losers, like all of you people. And then we discovered the Invig... (thunder crashes)</p>
<p>(deep voice): Invigaron!</p>
<p>And it all starts with the berries. The berries are the most delici...</p>
<p>I'm sure you're all excited to learn more about the Invigaron system.</p>
<p>What the hell happened to my part, Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to do some reshoots.</p>
<p>You are way too hung up on the berries.</p>
<p>The success of the Invigaron system is largely due to the simplicity of its origins.</p>
<p>Using a multi-tiered distribu...</p>
<p>...multi-level market...</p>
<p>...the Invigaron system...</p>
<p>...multi-level...</p>
<p>(thunder crashes)</p>
<p>(deep voice): Invig...</p>
<p>I'm Andy, proud owner of my own mountain, where...</p>
<p>(lid clatters)</p>
<p>Did a couple reshoots of my own.</p>
<p>Proud owner of my own mountain, where I'm a magical bean farmer.</p>
<p>Berries!</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>Does the sophisticated business model of Invigaron confuse you?</p>
<p>You don't need to understand how Invigaron works, because somebody above you does.</p>
<p>So ask less questions, and make more money.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't quite finished, there's...</p>
<p>Still not convinced?</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>The Invigaron system is also a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>(register dings)</p>
<p>"What's a pyramid scheme?" you ask.</p>
<p>All right, basically a house of cards where the dickheads at the bottom do all the work, and give all the money to the smart guys up at the top.</p>
<p>All right? Now, will you get... Don't just be successful. Be berry...</p>
<p>You won't need a pot of gold.</p>
<p>But still amazingly badass...</p>
<p>So do...</p>
<p>(high-pitched tone)</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>All right, any questions?</p>
<p>DA'MANIAC: I have a question.</p>
<p>Uh, how do I get in on this?</p>
<p>Uh, you probably don't, because you need money.</p>
<p>Ben, how many boxes am I gonna put you down for?</p>
<p>I don't really understand what I'm buying.</p>
<p>You saw the video.</p>
<p>Was the video not clear?</p>
<p>The video was pretty clear, Charlie.</p>
<p>You think maybe it's your stress?</p>
<p>Do you want to check your photon levels?</p>
<p>Oh. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could be stressed.</p>
<p>It... okay.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, where should I put my feet?</p>
<p>Dee, where do his feet go?</p>
<p>The feet go wherever.</p>
<p>What is it with the feet?</p>
<p>(Da'Maniac grunts)</p>
<p>Thank you for this business opportunity.</p>
<p>I will not let you down.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Sir, you need to pay for the product, you can't just take it out of here.</p>
<p>Roger!</p>
<p>Roger that.</p>
<p>He's just... he's just leaving the bar.</p>
<p>He just stole the berries. That's not g...</p>
<p>(machine beeping) Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, 107.</p>
<p>Hey, man, that's pretty good.</p>
<p>(Ben chuckles)</p>
<p>What? Don't...</p>
<p>Healthy guy over here.</p>
<p>Charlie, no, that's terrible.</p>
<p>He's very stressed out and he needs to buy the product and eat the berries.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>I-I'm sorry. Um, I don't think this is for me.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it!</p>
<p>If 107's bad, I got to eat more berries.</p>
<p>Stop eating berries!</p>
<p>You've had enough berries!</p>

<p>(Frank panting)</p>
<p>I just don't understand.</p>
<p>Is it a sexual thing?</p>
<p>No, just get me the hell out!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter!</p>
<p>Matters to me; I don't think I can move past it.</p>
<p>We came here for a reason.</p>
<p>Let's just jump into it, all right?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Frank, we have a very exciting real estate opportunity for you in sunny Orlando, Florida. Yes.</p>
<p>How would you like to spend one week out of the year living the high life at your own private villa at the Dusty Dunes Resort?</p>
<p>You guys bought a time-share?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. How can you all be so gullible?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, this is different, Frank.</p>
<p>This is different.</p>
<p>Tell him.</p>
<p>This asshole tried to sell us one week.</p>
<p>We took the prick for three.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>You took him for three weeks?</p>
<p>Dennis thought of it.</p>
<p>You think he didn't want to sell you as many weeks as possible?</p>
<p>No, I don't think he...</p>
<p>I told you that might have been a concern, I...</p>
<p>No, I know, but I...</p>
<p>The whole way over, you said that's...</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Well, look, I didn't come here to be criticized by a man stuck in a coil!</p>
<p>Are you gonna buy a week or not?</p>
<p>No, I'm not that stupid.</p>
<p>We don't need this.</p>
<p>We're out of here, Frank.</p>
<p>Screw you.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I-I-I can help you.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I can help you. Yeah.</p>
<p>Help us how?</p>
<p>I'll give you a premium lead on a deep-pocket dummy.</p>
<p>Premium lead?</p>
<p>That's business talk.</p>
<p>We need premium leads.</p>
<p>Yeah. Who? You promise to get me out of here?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, Frank, we promise.</p>
<p>What do you think, we're gonna leave you in a coil?</p>
<p>Give us a name.</p>
<p>Ben the Soldier.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Ben the Soldier, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yeah...</p>
<p>That's pretty good.</p>
<p>It is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He's very, very dumb.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>He went over there, probably saw some pretty serious carnage.</p>
<p>He's gonna have some bad PTSD.</p>
<p>If we trigger that, he'll be putty in our hands.</p>
<p>Right, whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, get me out of here.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Nah. Nah.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>(laughing) No.</p>
<p>Wait, whoa, whoa. Where you going?</p>
<p>You just got got, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, you played your hand a little too early, sucker.</p>
<p>We'll come back when we need you again.</p>
<p>That's called leverage.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's business talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, thought you were good at that stuff.</p>
<p>The kids are coming! What...</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The kids!</p>
<p>The kids will be here!</p>
<p>(knocking)</p>
<p>Now listen.</p>
<p>We just need to trigger his PTSD a little bit, all right?</p>
<p>Get him all jumbled up.</p>
<p>Couple of sudden movements.</p>
<p>Loud noises.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Ben!</p>
<p>It's so good to see you, man.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>Have a seat on the couch, why don't you?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Hi. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Da'Maniac.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Well, I've come for the presentation.</p>
<p>Gonna be really cool, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, it's... it's sort of... geared specifically towards Ben, so...</p>
<p>I like him, too.</p>
<p>He a good guy, huh?</p>
<p>Nice to see you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>He's coming in.</p>
<p>Hey, Ben.</p>
<p>How you doing?</p>
<p>All right, let's just, uh...</p>
<p>Okay, uh...</p>
<p>All right, listen, so, Ben...</p>
<p>(music begins playing)</p>
<p>Um, we would like to offer you a week's stay in our time-share condom in Florida.</p>
<p>It's an amazing property.</p>
<p>I mean, when we first saw it, we were like, "Boom!"</p>
<p>(Da'Maniac gasping)</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>Sometimes, loud noises make the squirrels go in my head, and I-I don't fight in the ring anymore, but I still fight with the demons in Da'Maniac's head.</p>
<p>All right, well, we'll-we'll try to be a little bit more sensitive to that.</p>
<p>I... Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, and we'll keep our voices down from here on out.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, Ben, should we talk numbers?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Um, and it sounds really nice, but I'm not trying to make any business decisions.</p>
<p>I have a 107 stress level.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I shouldn't be here.</p>
<p>I-I have to go.</p>
<p>Well, wait, Ben, stop. Ben...</p>
<p>Don't go, Ben.</p>
<p>No, the sunshine state.</p>
<p>(Mac sighs)</p>
<p>(door closes)</p>
<p>Oh, uh, I'm in.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Well, no. See, Maniac, it's very expensive. It's, like, $1,400.</p>
<p>Sold to the Maniac for $1,400.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You know why? 'Cause I can pay you in Invigaron.</p>
<p>I don't think you're quite understanding.</p>
<p>Uh, this involves you giving us cash, not a product that we would then sell.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>See, we need cash money.</p>
<p>Oh, you're...</p>
<p>We're on the same page.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don't even understand what he's talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hold on one second.</p>
<p>No, take your time.</p>
<p>Listen, I think we might have been wrong about Dee and Charlie's little investment.</p>
<p>I mean, they're out there moving berries like crazy.</p>
<p>If those bozos can do it, think how many you and I can sell.</p>
<p>We could flip 'em, like, ten times over.</p>
<p>That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p>So I say we swindle Da'Maniac while we got him here.</p>
<p>Let's get in on Dee and Charlie's little game.</p>
<p>Smart.</p>
<p>Pyramid scheme and a time-share?</p>
<p>We're diversifying our portfolio.</p>
<p>That's the thing.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. Hey, Maniac?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, you just got yourself a deal.</p>
<p>We're in business together?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's so cool.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go grab my stuff, and then, if you wouldn't mind, could you show me which room is mine?</p>
<p>I'd like a big room, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>We're gonna have so much fun.</p>
<p>Invigaron.</p>
<p>(door closes)</p>
<p>Uh... is-is he under the impression that our apartment is the time-share?</p>
<p>It would appear so.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>We'll deal with that later.</p>
<p>Let focus on getting Ben to crack.</p>
<p>All right, now, between Da'Maniac stealing our berries and these night vision goggles, we're in a bit of a hole, so we got to make this count.</p>
<p>Okay. What's the plan exactly?</p>
<p>We're gonna trigger Ben's PTSD, all right?</p>
<p>We bust in like Navy SEALs, zip-tie his hands, bag over his head, and then we bash him till he buys.</p>
<p>PTSD-- that's so brilliant.</p>
<p>How's Frank come up with that stuff?</p>
<p>What can you say?</p>
<p>He knows business.</p>
<p>Okay, ready?</p>
<p>Locked and loaded?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's go, Charlie.</p>
<p>Let's move.</p>
<p>(men shouting)</p>
<p>(gunfire)</p>
<p>(men shouting foreign language)</p>
<p>(Dee and Charlie screaming)</p>
<p>(all yelling)</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p>Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>We were gonna try and trigger Ben's PTSD and make him buy our shit.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>We've been at it all night.</p>
<p>We broke in here, looking like Arabs, screaming at him.</p>
<p>The guy's rock solid. Why did you dress him like Ebenezer Scrooge? Yeah.</p>
<p>He was actually dressed like at when we got here.</p>
<p>He's clearly got some issues.</p>
<p>I just don't know that PTSD is one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've been watching violent war movies all night to remind him of the carnage that he saw in combat.</p>
<p>I didn't see any carnage.</p>
<p>Um, I actually had a good time during the war.</p>
<p>I got to travel the world, uh, try new, exotic cuisines.</p>
<p>Well, I'm a computer programmer.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>(Charlie groans)</p>
<p>Frank told us this dummy was the key to digging ourselves out of our financial debt.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Frank told us the same thing.</p>
<p>Well, that's interesting.</p>
<p>So, we're all here doing this because of Frank.</p>
<p>See, I told you he was up to something.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Getting all naked and cramming yourself into a coil-- that's a pretty good distraction, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and think about it.</p>
<p>He didn't tell us why he was in that coil.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I just assumed that he went down there to pound off in the nighttime.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, me, too. Me, too.</p>
<p>But now I'm absolutely sure he had an agenda.</p>
<p>I bet he was never stuck in that coil at all.</p>
<p>He's been at the top of the pyramid the whole time just gathering our cash.</p>
<p>Oh, right, right, or at the bottom of the funnel.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which way it works.</p>
<p>Bottom of the funnel, top of the-- they're the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I bet you when we go down there, he's not even in there, is he?</p>
<p>No. Hell, no, he's not in that coil, but I know exactly where he will be.</p>
<p>All right, everyone, we have a new addition to the platinum sales staff, and let me just tell you something.</p>
<p>This guy is an absolute dynamo.</p>
<p>Scam! This guy's a liar!</p>
<p>You guys are getting scammed!</p>
<p>You're getting scammed!</p>
<p>Pyramid! Pyramid!</p>
<p>rape! rape! rape! rape! rape!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you what's going on.</p>
<p>We are saving these people from years of financial rape.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, if you want out of Invigaron, all you have to do is say so.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I do?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Look, you just, uh, sign this release form, pay a $200 penalty fee, your down line will shift up to me, and then you're free and clear.</p>
<p>That's it? All you got to do is sign the document?</p>
<p>Can we do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, does that mean we're out of the time-share?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I'm afraid I can't help you there.</p>
<p>Those contracts are ironclad.</p>
<p>I'm just relieved you didn't see the old opt-out clause.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>He just subtly motioned to this document here-- opt-out.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Oh, crap, I've said too much.</p>
<p>"Buyer may opt out of the contract within 72 hours for one-time cancellation fee of only $2,000."</p>
<p>You figured it out.</p>
<p>Oh, you fool. I have...</p>
<p>You didn't think we were gonna see this, but we outsmarted you. Yeah.</p>
<p>We're a couple of foxes.</p>
<p>All right, you got got!</p>
<p>So suck on that little piece of sweetness.</p>
<p>(Mac laughs) You also wrote "faced" in the memo. Ha! Nice!</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Should have known better than to get involved with a couple sharks like you two.</p>
<p>You should have. We're just glad we're out from under Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who's Frank?</p>
<p>Oh, "Who's Frank?" he says.</p>
<p>Like he doesn't know.</p>
<p>Come on, everybody.</p>
<p>Frank's the guy who's behind all this; Frank is the mastermind in the coil.</p>
<p>I sincerely have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Oh, sure you don't, buddy.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>He might not 'cause Frank...</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, you thought we came in mad.</p>
<p>Wait till you see what this monster has to say.</p>
<p>This guy?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>This guy's the best salesman I got.</p>
<p>Da'Maniac?</p>
<p>Yeah. He's already got 30 people under him.</p>
<p>I got to thank you all so much for hooking me up with that army guy. I got his whole platoon selling for me. Wait a sec.</p>
<p>Da'Maniac's on my down line.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>(gasps) I'm rich. I'm rich.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>(cheering and laughing)</p>
<p>ALL (chanting): You got got!</p>
<p>You got got! You got got!</p>
<p>Oh, whoa, one second.</p>
<p>One second, guys.</p>
<p>Actually, he's in my down line.</p>
<p>You just bought out, remember?</p>
<p>Shoot!</p>
<p>(all oohing)</p>
<p>No, you... Oh!</p>
<p>This guy's good.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You know, sorry.</p>
<p>I want to get this stuff done here, and then I'll meet you back at our time-share, huh?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now, what's going on there?</p>
<p>Is he, like, living with you guys, or...?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He's... It's-it's a whole thing. Just move past it.</p>
<p>That's a hard thing to move past.</p>
<p>Yeah, doesn't know what time-share is.</p>
<p>All right, but hold on a second, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Is Frank still the mastermind?</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p>
<p>Is he still in the coil?</p>
<p>No, he's not still in the coil.</p>
<p>Come on, guys, he's definitely still behind this.</p>
<p>He's probably down in Orlando enjoying that time-share.</p>
<p>He's long gone.</p>
<p>Right. Wherever he is, he's having a real good time.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(kids chattering)</p>
<p>(Frank grunts)</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, easy, easy, easy.</p>
<p>I gotta get out of here!</p>
<p>Get me out of here!</p>
<p>Get me out of here!</p>
