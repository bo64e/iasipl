<p><em>On the side.</p>
<p>You didn't do that on purpose.</p>
<p>Otherwise that would have been a great shot.</p>
<p>Watch this. Side pocket.</em></p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>"Christopher Murray, a teacher at St. Vincent's Elementary... has been accused of sexually abusing two former students."</p>
<p>St. Vincent's? That's that school you went to, right, Mac?</p>
<p>Yeah, me and Charlie.</p>
<p>What else does it say?</p>
<p>"Murray has been the physical education teacher and boys' basketball coach for 25 years."</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Ah. "The accusers are two brothers whose names are being withheld...</p>
<p>"but the investigation will focus on the mid-1980s...</p>
<p>"as the time period for alleged abuse.</p>
<p>The police are hoping more young men will come forward."</p>
<p>Wow. That's horrible.</p>
<p>Did this guy teach you guys?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes, he did.</p>
<p>We were in the same class.</p>
<p>No. Yeah. Well, no, I didn't like it though.</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>I didn't like that class.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I gotta go!</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Charlie got molested.</p>
<p><em>When dealing with molestation, the first step is always understanding.</em></p>
<p>So we need to take a moment and assess the situation. Write this down.</p>
<p>What? No, look. First of all, we can't sit around and let him wallow in it.</p>
<p>And second of all, the first step is acknowledgment. So I better write that down.</p>
<p><em>No. No, no.</p>
<p>Whoa! What, guys...</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys talking about?</em></p>
<p>Sweet Dee and I took psychology at Penn, so let the grown-ups talk.</p>
<p>Okay? Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p><em>Listen. I think we need to have an intervention.</em></p>
<p>You know, bring his friends and family together for support.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good idea.</p>
<p>Let's tell everybody Charlie knows that he got blown by a gym teacher.</p>
<p>Then we'll throw him a little surprise party, celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>You being a smartass... not helping Charlie.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Who said anything about getting blown?</p>
<p>The article didn't specify what type of abuse it was. It could have been anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, but do you think he got blown?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know? Probably got blown.</p>
<p>Which is why I think you need to reconsider my idea.</p>
<p>Okay. You know what? Stop. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>We need to clarify something here.</p>
<p>Do you think that Murray blew these guys?</p>
<p>Why are you so obsessed with the blowing aspect of all this?</p>
<p>Because I knew these two brothers that the article was talking about.</p>
<p>The McPoyle twins...</p>
<p>Ryan and Liam. Okay?</p>
<p>They were the type of kids that would blow snot bubbles and rub 'em over each other.</p>
<p>They were gross, and they smelled like a couple of unwiped assholes.</p>
<p><em>So what?</em></p>
<p>Well, if Murray is, like, fondling or touching them, whatever...</p>
<p>I get it, all right?</p>
<p>But if he's dishing out blow jobs, come on.</p>
<p>I just don't understand.</p>
<p>What do you not get?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You're not getting this?</p>
<p>I was in that class with them, all right?</p>
<p>I was with those guys!</p>
<p>Um, are you okay, dude?</p>
<p>No, dude. I'm not okay.</p>
<p>How come you're getting so upset?</p>
<p>The police are asking for more young men to come forward.</p>
<p>That means there are more guys out there who've been blown.</p>
<p><em>What are you looking for?</p>
<p>Photographs. I have photographs.</em></p>
<p>Oh, my God. You have photographs of it?</p>
<p>Oh! Okay.</p>
<p>Listen, are you trying to say that you got molested?</p>
<p>Okay, look at this.</p>
<p>Look at this guy, huh?</p>
<p>I was cute.</p>
<p>I was energetic. I was fun.</p>
<p>I mean, what exactly was this prick looking for?</p>
<p>What are you...</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>If the McPoyles got blown and Charlie got blown... then why didn't I get blown?</p>
<p>You're goin' to hell, dude.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Yo! McPoyle!</p>
<p>Hey, open up!</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie. Long time no see.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Is your brother here, man? I gotta talk to you guys.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Can I come in?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>I need to talk to you guys. Go. Move. Go.</p>
<p>Go. Come on.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna walk in front of you! Go.</p>
<p>Just come in.</p>
<p>No, you go first, and I will follow you.</p>
<p>Shut the door.</p>
<p><em>I will shut the door.</em></p>
<p>Whoa. That was really weird.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, this confirms it.</p>
<p>He definitely got molested.</p>
<p>Ugh. We gotta get in there.</p>
<p>Get... We gotta get in there?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can't just thrust yourself in the position of caregiver like that.</p>
<p>"Caregiver"? Why are you throwing around big words?</p>
<p>I actually majored in psych, so...</p>
<p>You failed all your classes.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>I had a minor, and I passed all mine.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? Three-quarters of a major is bigger than a whole minor.</p>
<p>I don't even know how to respond to that.</p>
<p>That doesn't surprise me.</p>
<p>Well, it shouldn't because what you said is really dumb, you know.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>That was good. I liked that one.</p>
<p>I felt good about it.</p>
<p>So did you want a beverage of some kind?</p>
<p>No! Where's your brother?</p>
<p>We just stepped out of the shower.</p>
<p>He'll be down in a minute.</p>
<p>Listen, you guys can't go...</p>
<p>Did you just say "we"?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Did you just say, "We just stepped out of the shower"?</p>
<p>I said "he."</p>
<p>Right. Okay. Listen.</p>
<p>I heard about the Coach Murray thing.</p>
<p>You guys cannot go to the police and say that he molested you.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because he didn't molest you!</p>
<p>That's true, but he's a dick, and we hated him.</p>
<p>This is our chance for revenge. You want in?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p><em>I think you do.</em></p>
<p>Hello, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hello, Ryan.</p>
<p>I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news recently... but there are millions to be made here, my friend.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, there's the classic route of priest molestation... but we thought we'd mix it up a bit.</p>
<p>We're going after the whole damn school board.</p>
<p>If you want in on the team, we could probably get a nice class-action suit going.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, first of all, there are people out there who actually have been molested.</p>
<p>And you guys are gonna exploit that for your own personal gain?</p>
<p>You assholes are securing your place in hell.</p>
<p>We thought about it. We're willing to roll the dice.</p>
<p>I won't let you do it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna call the cops.</p>
<p>Oh, no, you won't, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I will.</p>
<p>Oh, my friend, I'm afraid not.</p>
<p>And why not?</p>
<p>We'll tell the cops the whole thing was your idea.</p>
<p>We should tell the cops that that fat dickhead gym teacher... we had in junior high molested us... and just sue the shit out of him!</p>
<p>L... I was joking.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I'm not joking though.</p>
<p>I'm not joking. I'm really not.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even joke about something like that.</p>
<p>We should do it. I wanna do it.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>We'd hate to have to put this whole thing on your shoulders.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>So you're gonna have to keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p>You don't have to join us, but if anyone asks you point-blank...</p>
<p>Your ass got molested.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're talking conspiracy charges.</p>
<p>And prison can be a bad place... for someone like you, Charlie.</p>
<p>A very bad place.</p>
<p>Soon as Charlie comes out, we gotta grab him, take him back to the bar... get him liquored up and tell him, "We know you got molested."</p>
<p>Gonna have to disagree with you, Sis.</p>
<p>I think we need to ease him into it.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? Dr. Gainer used to say that in situations like this...</p>
<p>Dr. Gainer?</p>
<p>That guy was an idiot.</p>
<p>He was not.</p>
<p>Yes, he was.</p>
<p>Talk about molesters. That guy...</p>
<p>He didn't molest me.</p>
<p>I had sex with him 'cause I wanted to.</p>
<p>You had sex with Dr. Gainer?</p>
<p>Of course I did.</p>
<p>No, you had... Oh!</p>
<p>He was a hot older man.</p>
<p>Gross!</p>
<p>Okay. You know what? You have no room to talk. All the girls you've molested.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. Don't start throwing that word around like it's meaningless, okay?</p>
<p>This is serious.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Molester.</p>
<p>Hey, Coach Murray!</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>It's me... Mac!</p>
<p>I don't know what this shit is all about.</p>
<p>One day the cops just roll into my classroom and they haul me out of there.</p>
<p>And they did it right in front of my kids too.</p>
<p>Yeah. Totally.</p>
<p>Molestation?</p>
<p>I mean, please!</p>
<p>I got so much ass back in those days.</p>
<p>What the hell did I need that kind of shit for?</p>
<p>God, man, I hear you.</p>
<p>So much ass, it was like... Whew.</p>
<p>Oh, and you know what, to tell you the truth?</p>
<p>I don't even remember who these assholes are that are accusing me.</p>
<p>Nothing special there, right?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Nothing special. You know, Coach, I've been working out a lot since grammar school.</p>
<p>Good for you, son.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's good for you, right?</p>
<p>You know when you get real tight, like, right up in here in this area here?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not here. Like right in here.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>All right. L... Okay.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>That's a good shot, bud.</p>
<p>Hey, tell me something, man.</p>
<p>What's been going on with you lately?</p>
<p>You just seem...</p>
<p>You know, um, I'm just distracted.</p>
<p>Is that why you ran out of the bar the other day?</p>
<p>No. No. I was...</p>
<p>I had some stuff I needed to do.</p>
<p>It just popped in my head.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that's understandable.</p>
<p>We've all got things that we have to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What you running from, Charlie?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Dee, could you grab me a beer?</p>
<p>Grab one yourself.</p>
<p>I'm right in the middle of a game.</p>
<p>Your game isn't working.</p>
<p>Let me play now.</p>
<p>Let me play the game the way I want to play it.</p>
<p><em>Your way is dumb, and it's not working.</p>
<p>Then we'll play your game.</em></p>
<p>It's not gonna get the results we want.</p>
<p>You're playing a game for children, and it's not working.</p>
<p>Charlie's not a baby. Charlie!</p>
<p>Great. Nice.</p>
<p>Good job, Dennis. Great.</p>
<p>How are you gonna put this on me?</p>
<p>You messed it up!</p>
<p>You messed it up!</p>
<p>We have to push him!</p>
<p>Push him? You're pushing him away.</p>
<p>Now he knows something's up.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Good?</p>

<p>Guys, I have good news!</p>
<p>I've been reading up on the subject of pedophilia.</p>
<p>It turns out that it isn't about sex after all.</p>
<p>It's about power.</p>
<p>So, the assailant doesn't go after the one he finds most attractive... this guy.</p>
<p>He goes after the weakest he can find.</p>
<p>Wow. That is good news.</p>
<p>Jesus, Mac. What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>No. You're not following.</p>
<p>If Murray was looking for the weakest he could find, it wouldn't have been Charlie.</p>
<p><em>Why not?</p>
<p>Because Charlie was a bit of a psychopath.</em></p>
<p>When he got excited, his face would turn purple and he'd start biting things.</p>
<p>I don't think Murray would've put his dick anywhere near him.</p>
<p>What about the McPoyle brothers?</p>
<p>They were prime real estate.</p>
<p>I'm sure he went to town on them.</p>
<p>What's your point?</p>
<p>Charlie didn't get molested.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Good. I'm sure he didn't.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>I'm sure he didn't.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Leave this to the two people that are qualified to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>It is cute that you did some research and got four books though.</p>
<p><em>Nice work.</p>
<p>Yeah, goodjob.</em></p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We tried it your little tippy-toe pussy way.</p>
<p>That failed miserably. So now why don't we try something that will work?</p>
<p>Look, I just want to say that I think this is a terrible approach.</p>
<p>You know how I already know that?</p>
<p>'Cause you keep saying it.</p>
<p>I keep saying it because... it is.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you're wrong about stuff all the time.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you're sorry all the time.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p><em>Well, hello, Dennis!</p>
<p>Hi, Mrs. Kelly.</em></p>
<p>Don't you look so handsome!</p>
<p>And, Dee, so beautiful.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mrs. Kelly.</p>
<p>I'm sorry we had to stop by like this, but we really need to talk to you about something.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's about Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, I can't believe this!</p>
<p>I just can't believe it!</p>
<p>Though I have to admit, it does explain a lot about him.</p>
<p>Yes, we were thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>Yes. Oh. Be strong, Bonnie.</p>
<p>Be strong for your little gingerbread man.</p>
<p>Now is not the time for an episode.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine!</p>
<p>So, what do you need from me?</p>
<p>Hello? Ma?</p>
<p><em>In here, Charlie!</em></p>
<p>Hey, I got your message.</p>
<p>You sounded kinda funny.</p>
<p><em>Come on back, honey.</p>
<p>Is everything all right?</em></p>
<p>Hello, Charlie.</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p><em>Grandma? UncleJack?</p>
<p>What's... What's everybody doing here?</p>
<p>Well, we've all gathered here at the request of your friends.</em></p>
<p>Hey, bud.</p>
<p>Hi, Charlie.</p>
<p>Hello, Charles.</p>
<p>L... I don't exactly know how one of these things are supposed to go.</p>
<p><em>But we understand that there's been some abuse.</em></p>
<p>These two boys have been strong enough to admit what happened... and we thank you for that.</p>
<p>Just hope that that man goes away for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Prison can be a bad place for a guy like that.</p>
<p>Very bad place.</p>
<p><em>Now, we're not exactly sure how this thing is supposed to go.</em></p>
<p>But your friends have been helping us out... on a couple of key points.</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie, show us on the doll.</p>
<p>Show you what?</p>
<p>Where he touched you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Shall I turn it over?</p>
<p>Yeah, turn her over.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Slow. Slow.</p>
<p>I think that went well.</p>
<p>You did a wonderful job, Charlie.</p>
<p><em>I really think they bought it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Definitely.</em></p>
<p>I gotta say, my favorite part was at the end there when we were all hugging... and my sister screamed and told everyone that I touched her vagina.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>So, Charlie... where to?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I was thinking we should, uh, zip down to the police station... file an official report.</p>
<p>I gotta do it sometime, right?</p>
<p>That's the spirit.</p>
<p>Let's get it on the books.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I'd like to, uh, speak to a detective, please.</p>
<p>Name?</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly.</p>
<p>And what is this in reference to?</p>
<p>Sodomy.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, take a seat.</p>
<p>Someone will be right with you.</p>
<p>You're doing the right thing, Charlie.</p>
<p>The American school system's been oppressing people for years.</p>
<p>It's about time we start doing a little oppressing ourselves.</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>How are we oppressing anything?</p>
<p>You need to think before you speak.</p>
<p><em>You do.</p>
<p>Charlie Kelly?</em></p>
<p>Oh. That's me.</p>
<p>Uh, I'll be right back.</p>
<p>Have a good time.</p>
<p>Twenty-five million is a lot of clams.</p>
<p>Split it 50-50.</p>
<p>Charlie's gonna want something.</p>
<p>How 'bout Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah. He'll want some.</p>
<p>He's not gonna get some.</p>
<p>We could always split it 50-50-50.</p>
<p>You even hear what you're saying?</p>
<p>Your gums are bleeding.</p>
<p>How'd it go?</p>
<p>Great. I just ratted you out.</p>
<p>Can I see you two boys for a minute, please?</p>
<p>So you're not gonna get in any trouble at all?</p>
<p>Uh, no. No, not really.</p>
<p>And since the McPoyles are gonna plead guilty, I'm off the hook completely.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Sorry. Was he saying that the intervention worked?</p>
<p>No, I don't think that's what he's saying.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>It was the final push Charlie needed.</p>
<p>Turns out three-quarters of a major... not so bad after all.</p>
<p>And the best part of it, actually, for me now is the fact... that everybody thinks that I've been molested.</p>
<p>So, in a way, my life is ruined.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm gonna go in the back office and cry and cry and cry... and drink for a while.</p>
<p><em>Emotional release.</em></p>
<p>Another giant step forward.</p>
<p>My God, we're good.</p>
<p>Doctor.</p>
<p>Doctor.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so I just want to apologize again for the other day.</p>
<p>It's all right, Mac. Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Awkward, right?</p>
<p>You know what? You were a good student at school. You got potential.</p>
<p>Just put that in your pocket.</p>
<p>Really? You mean that?</p>
<p>I mean that.</p>
<p>Great, Coach. That's all I really needed to hear.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That is so great for me.</p>
<p><em>Hey, say hi to those folks for me.</p>
<p>I will. Thanks.</em></p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>That little prick's goin' to hell.</p>
