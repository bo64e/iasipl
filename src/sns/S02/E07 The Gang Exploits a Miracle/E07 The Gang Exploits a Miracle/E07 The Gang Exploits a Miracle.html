<p><em>Most would agree.</p>
<p>I don't agree.</p>
<p>Will you look at your skin?</p>
<p>I am. What's the matter with it?</em></p>
<p>It's all blotchy.</p>
<p>How? I don't see it.</p>
<p>Dad, will you look at Sweet Dee's skin and tell me it's not blotchy?</p>
<p>Do I have to listen to this shit all morning?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Frank, you've gotta be kidding with these receipts.</p>
<p>We were actually doing better before you took over.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! What's up, guys?</p>
<p>I didn't hear you guys come in.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, I was actually in here early opening up this morning...</p>
<p>Charlie, we had an agreement.</p>
<p>This is a place of business, not your home.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I know that.</p>
<p>Not supposed to sleep in the bar anymore, bro.</p>
<p>I wasn't.</p>
<p>You didn't come home last night.</p>
<p><em>Oh, okay, okay.</p>
<p>Well, guess what.</em></p>
<p>I found some extensive water damage in the back office.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, maybe I'm not such a bad guy... for passing out in there and drinking too much or whatever.</p>
<p>That's a terrible excuse, dude.</p>
<p>Well, I drank too much, so lay off.</p>
<p><em>Holy shit! Guys, come here!</p>
<p>Come here! Check this out!</em></p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That is the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><em>What?</p>
<p>Oh, take it easy, bro.</em></p>
<p>No, look. The head and the arms and the cape.</p>
<p>Does look like it. Weird.</p>
<p>I don't see it.</p>
<p>What if it's a sign?</p>
<p>You guys, remember, I wanted to be a priest.</p>
<p>That's a water stain, dude.</p>
<p>Or it could be a sign that we need to get our pipes fixed.</p>
<p>What if it's a miracle?</p>
<p>Listen. It could be a miracle.</p>
<p>It could be bullshit.</p>
<p>There's only one thing we know for sure.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>It's a goddamn gold mine.</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you, Jim.</p>
<p>I was in the back office... and I'd just finished praying on my rosaries.</p>
<p>And I was doing some crunches, you know, working on my abs.</p>
<p>And that's when I saw it.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself...</p>
<p>"That is definitely the mother of our Lord."</p>
<p>Did my face look fat?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, don't-don't screw with me here.</p>
<p>Seriously. It's just the TV, right?</p>
<p>No, it's been looking fat.</p>
<p><em>So, if you like the Virgin Mary and you like beer, come on down to Paddy's Pub.</em></p>
<p>We got 'em both.</p>
<p>Welcome to Paddy's Pub, home of the Blessed Mother.</p>
<p>Would you care to make a donation?</p>
<p>How much should I give?</p>
<p>Well, what price can one put on the viewing of a miracle?</p>
<p>Give whatever you can.</p>
<p>These people are pathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dad, I really don't feel very good about what we're doing in here.</p>
<p>Well, don't get all high-and-mighty on me.</p>
<p>I only made four dollars, Deandra.</p>
<p>I think I can live with myself.</p>
<p>Let's move, lady. We got a long line here.</p>
<p>Don't be selfish. All right. Rollin' on in.</p>
<p>This is one of the more ridiculous things we have ever done, dude.</p>
<p>I will tell you what is ridiculous...</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the mother of God.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>That is a water stain, man.</p>
<p>We are really pushing our luck with the big guy upstairs on this one.</p>
<p>Dude, if you don't think you're going to hell, you need to take a long look at yourself.</p>
<p>Go look at yourself, bro.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, do it.</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds?</p>
<p>Oh, wow. It is you.</p>
<p>Matthew Mara.</p>
<p>We were in physical therapy together twice a week after school.</p>
<p>I was the only other person in physical therapy with you.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>I wore the giant leg braces.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah, with the leg braces.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow. You look different.</p>
<p>Yeah, so do you. No more back brace, I see.</p>
<p>You look wonderful. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><em>Matty Mara?</p>
<p>Hello, Mac.</em></p>
<p>I knew it! I called it from across the bar, even without the cripple braces.</p>
<p>So, what? You're a priest now?</p>
<p>Wow! Look at you. Little Matty Mara all grown up, huh?</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis, little Matty Mara's here.</p>
<p>Hey-oh!</p>
<p>Hey, you come to witness the miracle for yourself?</p>
<p>Miracle's a strong word, Mac.</p>
<p>We don't just throw that around like a football.</p>
<p>Well, you should.</p>
<p>Well, I just came out of curiosity.</p>
<p>See what you had at this bar of yours.</p>
<p><em>You have to admit it's her, dude.</p>
<p>Well, it's quite a likeness.</p>
<p>Yeah. You think it's a sign?</p>
<p>No, it's a stain.</em></p>
<p>But, uh, it's an interesting stain.</p>
<p>I'll give you that.</p>
<p>Hey, Matty.</p>
<p>Hello, Dennis. How are you?</p>
<p>I've been better.</p>
<p>I've been better.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question, man. I know it's been years since we've seen each other... but does my face look fat to you?</p>
<p>Well, we've all put on a few pounds since high school, so...</p>
<p>Of course. Of course.</p>
<p>But I don't look fat though, right?</p>
<p>Um, no.</p>
<p>What did we call you in high school?</p>
<p>Rickety Cricket, dude!</p>
<p>That's right. Rickety Crickety Legs.</p>
<p>Yeah, his legs were...</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, remember how you would pass out at parties...</p>
<p><em>and Dennis would tea-bag you?</p>
<p>Yeah, then I would take the photo.</em></p>
<p>We'd pass it around the school.</p>
<p>Everybody loved those photos, Matty.</p>
<p>Hey, you still get balls-to-the-chin cracks?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Actually, that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>It would be funnier as a priest.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Those...</p>
<p>Those were hilarious.</p>
<p>You don't understand how much everybody loved those.</p>
<p>My balls on your chin.</p>
<p>Everybody loved you, man.</p>
<p>I think people still have copies.</p>
<p>There's a lot floating around.</p>
<p>I saw them on the Internet!</p>
<p>You were, like, famous in school.</p>
<p>Yeah, practically. I got a whole shoe box of those things.</p>
<p>That's partially our doing.</p>
<p>Well, let's... let's... I should get going, so, um...</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Check it out though.</p>
<p>Um, why did you pause before you said "no" earlier?</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>Well, earlier when I asked you if my face looked fat, you kind of paused.</p>
<p>I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Uh, listen, Dee, it was great seeing you again.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You too.</p>
<p>Gentlemen.</p>
<p>Cricket. - Later, Cricks.</p>
<p>See you, Rickety Crickety.</p>
<p><em>I love that guy.</p>
<p>How do you know the priest?</em></p>
<p>Went to high school with him.</p>
<p>We should get him to bless the stain.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This could be huge, Charlie.</p>
<p>I mean, endorsement from the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>No. No. See, you guys are taking this thing way too far.</p>
<p>You know what I'm gonna do?</p>
<p>Wash my hands of it.</p>
<p>Washing my hands of the whole situation, Lord.</p>
<p>He will smite you all.</p>
<p>God will smite you all!</p>
<p>Okay, uh, we should do it soon though because the pipe might leak a little more.</p>
<p>The stain could fade.</p>
<p>You think this priest would help you guys?</p>
<p>I think Dee could get him to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What? Why me?</p>
<p>Oh, "Why me?" she says.</p>
<p>The guy was in love with her.</p>
<p>He would do anything for her.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All right. Remember the time you said you'd kiss him... if he ate a horse turd?</p>
<p>He ate the whole turd.</p>
<p>The guy eats the whole thing.</p>
<p>Then she doesn't kiss him 'cause...</p>
<p>His breath smelled like shit.</p>
<p>That's my girl.</p>
<p>It didn't really happen like that.</p>
<p>No. He ate the whole turd, and then she wouldn't kiss him.</p>
<p>Hey, come on. This would be really good for the bar.</p>
<p>No. Screw you guys. No way.</p>
<p>That's a bad attitude.</p>
<p>The priest may not do it because she's getting old.</p>
<p><em>Oh! Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</em></p>
<p>Your skin's all blotchy.</p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>He's not gonna do it. You got the crow's-feet.</p>
<p>Crow's-feet.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>You're getting the lines there.</p>
<p>Mmm. Five head. Laugh lines.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>You guys are such assholes.</p>
<p>I'm gonna see what I can do.</p>
<p>Take care. Bye.</p>
<p>Matthew, hi.</p>
<p>Dee. Wow. What a nice surprise.</p>
<p>What brings you here?</p>
<p>Well, the guys and I kind of needed somebody to come and bless that stain in our bar.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Dee, I'm not gonna bless a water stain.</p>
<p>We don't do things like that.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church...</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I know not them.</p>
<p>I was hoping you could do me a favor.</p>
<p>I realize you were able to get me to do things for you in school, but...</p>
<p>Oh, you know what? I did. I kind of led you on a little bit back then, didn't I?</p>
<p>But I wasn't always a tease, you know?</p>
<p>Remember? I let you do all my math homework.</p>
<p>Not sure I follow your logic.</p>
<p>Well, what about that time we almost kissed?</p>
<p>You made me eat a...</p>
<p>Look, I'm not blessing the stain, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, no. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I mean, the taste of that thing alone...</p>
<p>No, I can't imagine.</p>
<p>It haunts me.</p>
<p>Of course it does.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, okay? Forget...</p>
<p>Forget I came by about the stain.</p>
<p>I don't care about that anymore.</p>
<p>I just... I know you really liked me back then, and I know I wasn't very nice to you.</p>
<p>And I think that's just because I was too stupid to realize how wonderful you are.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>And for the record, I think that you grew up to be very handsome.</p>
<p>You do realize you're leading me on right now?</p>
<p>I'm a priest.</p>
<p>Am I? Oh, I didn't even know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to grab a drink sometime...</p>
<p>You're still doing it.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. I don't...</p>
<p>Wow, I... I think it's just 'cause you look so handsome in...</p>
<p>Please leave.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm gonna go now.</p>
<p>Thank you. It would be best.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>God bless.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you care to make a donation in the name of Paddy's Pub to the Blessed Mother?</p>
<p>Mm-mmm.</p>
<p>Charlie, this needs to stop. If you guys don't do it...</p>
<p>I'm gonna do it myself.</p>
<p>You're telling me. I'm sick of doing this.</p>
<p><em>God is going to show his wrath, Charlie.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</em></p>
<p>Are you the young man to whom the Holy Mother first appear?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Could you bless me, please?</p>
<p>You want me to bless you?</p>
<p>Please, senor.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, sure, I guess.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p>Right hand.</p>
<p><em>Gracias.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</em></p>
<p>Did you see that, dude?</p>
<p>I just blessed that woman.</p>
<p>I may have saved that poor, wretched old person's life.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know about that, but, uh...</p>
<p>This could be my calling, Charlie.</p>
<p>What happened to all that God's wrath business, and this has to end...</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. Don't worry about that, dude.</p>
<p>I think this could actually be a good thing.</p>
<p>We could change the world.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. All right.</p>
<p>New plan, all right?</p>
<p>Let's go around, let's bless people.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I should bless people though, but you could be my right-hand man.</p>
<p>You could be my Peter.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll be your Peter.</p>
<p><em>Dress a little nicer though, 'cause you look like shit.</em></p>
<p>Hey. How'd it go with the priest?</p>
<p>Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Did you put the moves on him?</p>
<p>First of all, gross. I don't think you're supposed to whore out your kids.</p>
<p>Second of all, that guy is a really good person... and I've treated him like shit his whole life.</p>
<p>For once I'm gonna do the right thing.</p>
<p>He thinks you're too old, huh?</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Why do I speak to you, ever?</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I've been fasting for three days, so I probably look good.</p>
<p>You haven't eaten anything for three days?</p>
<p>And I feel great.</p>
<p>Why the hell are you fasting?</p>
<p>I thought I would get in the spirit of the religious aspect of what we got going.</p>
<p>It's 'cause we said his face looks fat.</p>
<p>It is not.</p>
<p>People have been fasting for thousands of years...</p>
<p>Face looks fat.</p>
<p>For health and religious purposes. Moses...</p>
<p>Fat face.</p>
<p>Jesus and Moses in the woods and in the desert...</p>
<p>Pretty fat, right? Fat.</p>
<p>Please listen to me. Please.</p>
<p>Forget it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right? The priest thinks Dee's too old for him.</p>
<p>We gotta go to plan "B."</p>
<p>I know another guy who could help us.</p>
<p>Father O'Grady? Uh...</p>
<p>I'm Frank Reynolds.</p>
<p>I was in your parish.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>We came to talk to you about a stain.</p>
<p>No! Uh, wait a second.</p>
<p>We just wanna have a few words with you.</p>
<p><em>We found a stain in our bar that resembles the Virgin Mary.</em></p>
<p>Cats are brown now.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The cats are brown.</p>
<p>What in the hell is he talking about?</p>
<p>This guy's perfect.</p>
<p>Let's go clean him up.</p>

<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What? It's like...</p>
<p>Why are you dressed like this?</p>
<p>Come on. It's perfect.</p>
<p>Where did you get it?</p>
<p>I have my sources.</p>
<p>I told you to dress nice.</p>
<p>We look like salt and pepper shakers.</p>
<p>Ah, we look good.</p>
<p>All right. Let's just get started.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Ah. Uh, excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>Hello. Uh, would you like a blessing?</p>
<p>From who?</p>
<p>Well, it was to me that the Virgin Mary first appeared.</p>
<p>Well, I found it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, I'm just saying I was the one who found it.</p>
<p>Yes, but, uh, I was the one who first recognized it was the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>I found it, if you want the truth.</p>
<p>You thought it was a stain.</p>
<p>I'd much prefer a blessing from him.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>He seems a lot more religious than you.</p>
<p>He is my number two and doesn't really do the same...</p>
<p>Well, maybe I could just throw you one of...</p>
<p>Don't do it.</p>
<p>Don't do it, Charlie. Don't do it!</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Okay, feel better.</p>
<p>You're looking better already to me.</p>
<p>You are completely betraying me. You're supposed to be my Peter.</p>
<p>You know what, dude?</p>
<p>Hear me out for a second.</p>
<p>Now, technically, that stain did appear to me.</p>
<p>Also, I am familiar with carpentry and I don't know who my father is... so am I the messiah?</p>
<p>I don't know. Could be.</p>
<p>I'm not ruling it out.</p>
<p>The messiah?</p>
<p>I'm just not ruling it out, is all.</p>
<p>You gotta be kidding me, dude.</p>
<p>Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.</p>
<p>I knew you were gonna ruin this.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Ooh. I really wish you wouldn't take my name in vain.</p>
<p><em>How are we gonna get this guy to bless anything? He's out ofhis mind.</em></p>
<p>Well, I'm hoping it's mostly the booze talking.</p>
<p>Let's find some coffee.</p>
<p>We can sober him up.</p>
<p>Did you hear me?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Dennis, I think you really gotta eat.</p>
<p>No, I just spaced out for a second. What's up?</p>
<p>Find some coffee. We don't have a ton of time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here's a confession.</p>
<p>I'm in love with a man.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm in love with a man... a man called God.</p>
<p>Does that make me gay?</p>
<p>Am I gay for God?</p>
<p>You betcha.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you, please?</p>
<p>Speaketh.</p>
<p>In private.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, congratulations, Jim Jones.</p>
<p><em>You found the four people on the planet dumb enough to listen to your shit.</em></p>
<p>Oh, forgive him, Lord, for he know not what he say.</p>
<p>Give it a rest. You're not the messiah.</p>
<p>You don't know dick about the Bible.</p>
<p>You know, it really sounds like somebody in this room is jealous.</p>
<p>Because it's bullshit!</p>
<p>I'm the one that wanted to become a priest...</p>
<p>I'm the one that knew it was Mary, I'm the one that should have followers.</p>
<p>Sorry, bro. You suck at it.</p>
<p>You wanna have a little competition?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Let's go toe-to-toe on the Bible, bitch.</p>
<p>Ask and ye shall receive, sucker.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</p>
<p>It has been 10 years since my last confession.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, what's on your mind, my dear?</p>
<p>I'm in love with a man that I can't have, Father.</p>
<p>And he used to love me too, but then I was really mean to him... and now we'll never know what could have been.</p>
<p>Well, it's too late now.</p>
<p>He's made a commitment that can never be broken.</p>
<p>Let's drop this act, Matty.</p>
<p>Listen, I think I have really strong feelings for you.</p>
<p>Dee, please don't do this.</p>
<p>You know what? It just seems like some kind of cruel joke.</p>
<p>I mean, you wanted me once, and now that you can have me...</p>
<p>And, oh, Matty, I mean you could really, really have me.</p>
<p>You don't want it anymore?</p>
<p>Well, God has a plan for everybody.</p>
<p>Well, that seems dumb.</p>
<p>Well, it's not. It's God's plan.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, God's plan sucks this time. You know why?</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>'Cause I think I love you, Matthew.</p>
<p>Don't say that, Dee.</p>
<p>I have to say it, and I'm gonna tell you why.</p>
<p>Because if I don't say it, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe that's not "God's plan" or whatever. I don't care.</p>
<p>I want you to know something.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>And I... I could be your wife, and I could spend the rest of my days making you happy.</p>
<p>Dee?</p>
<p>Yes. It's me.</p>
<p>I know it's you. Just please, please leave.</p>
<p>No, listen. Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I don't know what God wants for us, all right?</p>
<p>But I do know God brought you into our bar... and maybe that was just so I could say I'm sorry, but that sounds stupid.</p>
<p>I don't think that's why. That's not big enough.</p>
<p>He works bigger than that.</p>
<p>Maybe his plan is for us to be together because he did have you come to our bar. Matty?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Open the door.</p>
<p><em>No.</p>
<p>Matty, open the door.</em></p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Say seven Hail Marys.</p>
<p>Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p><em>"When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look at the burning bush...</em></p>
<p>"God called from within.</p>
<p>'Moses, come no closer!</p>
<p>Remove your sandals, for"'...</p>
<p>Uh, let's stop there.</p>
<p>Why is God asking Moses to remove his sandals?</p>
<p><em>Well, you didn't let me finish, dude.</p>
<p>It's because Moses is about to walk on holy ground.</em></p>
<p>No, actually, it's not.</p>
<p>Yes, it is. That's the next line.</p>
<p>"Remove your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."</p>
<p>But what's in between the lines?</p>
<p>What's in between the lines is that he has to take off his damn sandals... because it's sacred ground.</p>
<p>No! Sacred ground?</p>
<p>Sacred ground?</p>
<p>God doesn't worship the ground.</p>
<p>God made the ground.</p>
<p>And Moses is about to step near a burning bush.</p>
<p>That is gonna be hot.</p>
<p><em>God doesn't think Moses is gonna do it.</em></p>
<p>"Hey, Moses, kick your shoes off.</p>
<p>Come on. Walk around a burning bush"?</p>
<p>You know, that's like asking me to take my shoes off and stand on a hot plate.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna do it... unless God asks me to.</p>
<p>And then I am, just like Moses.</p>
<p>Why? What's gonna happen to Moses?</p>
<p>His feet aren't gonna get burned.</p>
<p>No. God is gonna reward him with some sweet-ass shoes.</p>
<p>It's like, "Oh. Oh. You risk your feet, you get some shoes."</p>
<p>That's the way God works, 'cause God loves us.</p>
<p>Trust in God, he'll give you shoes.</p>
<p><em>Are you kidding me?</em></p>
<p>You're buying this crap? You...</p>
<p><em>All right. Here we go.</em></p>
<p>Right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Who's this?</p>
<p>This crazy, drunk priest...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You get a drink after you bless the stain.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>Ooh, cats!</p>
<p>And they're brown!</p>
<p>Oh, this guy is great.</p>
<p>Hey, you think he'll bless me?</p>
<p>Love to.</p>
<p>Great. Hey!</p>
<p>It's okay, Frank.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, gather round.</p>
<p>This priest here is going to bless me.</p>
<p>Then after he's finished, I will honor each and every one of you with a blessing of your own.</p>
<p>You can take that with you.</p>
<p>Okay, Father. Anytime you're ready.</p>
<p>The Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you, old man?</p>
<p><em>Why would you bring somebody like this into the bar?</em></p>
<p>Charlie, get the camcorder.</p>
<p>The father's gonna bless the stain.</p>
<p>Right foot, left foot.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Dee. Dee.</p>
<p>Whoa. You are not lookin' good, huh?</p>
<p>Truth, truth. Face fat?</p>
<p>No, you idiot.</p>
<p>Your face is fine.</p>
<p>I just got mad that you called mine blotchy.</p>
<p>Oh. Why-Why-Why...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why you do that?</p>
<p>Oh, um, because you're a bad person.</p>
<p>Charlie, you got the camcorder?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, I got it.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac, Mac. This endorsement's gonna put me over the top.</p>
<p>Go to hell, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, these people are gonna be eating out of my divine hands.</p>
<p>These people are gonna catch on to your shit.</p>
<p>Are they really? Hello.</p>
<p>No! No, get away from there!</p>
<p><em>Get him away!</p>
<p>Get... Back off. Oh.</em></p>
<p>What did you do, you shithead? You ruined it!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh! It's gone!</p>
<p>Uh, no, actually, it's not gone.</p>
<p>It's gone!</p>
<p><em>The Virgin Mary has left us!</p>
<p>No, she hasn't left us!</em></p>
<p>You can see the outline.</p>
<p>She abandoned us 'cause we listen to a false prophet!</p>
<p>No! False pro...</p>
<p>False prophet.</p>
<p><em>That's what you are, a false prophet.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</em></p>
<p>Looks like your followers are leaving you.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Don't go. She'll come back.</p>
<p>She'll come back.</p>
<p>Dee.</p>
<p>Matthew? What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I thought about what you said, and I think you're right.</p>
<p>I mean, in some weird way, this was God's plan for us.</p>
<p>I mean, I had to become a priest to reconnect with you... and I had to leave the priesthood to have you.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds, I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on one second.</p>
<p>Bless you.</p>
<p>Hold on. Did you just say that you left the priesthood?</p>
<p>Yes! Yes, I had to.</p>
<p>Matty, wow. You should not have done that.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You gotta... You should go and undo that right now.</p>
<p>Uh, but you said...</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what I said.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things, and I meant all of them. I did.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I didn't know you were actually gonna leave the Church... which is why I felt safe saying those things in the first place.</p>
<p>So wait. Wait. So...</p>
<p>S-So you don't love me?</p>
<p>Oh, Matty.</p>
<p>I think you are a great guy.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>My life is r... My life is ruined.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's... Yes, it's ruined.</p>
<p>No. It's not.</p>
<p>What about this?</p>
<p>Why don't you go back to the priesthood?</p>
<p>I can't, okay?</p>
<p>L-I... I can't.</p>
<p>You can't just go back, Dee.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I wanna become a priest again." You can't.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>But are you sure? Did you double-check that?</p>
<p>Oh, my life is ruined.</p>
<p>Hmm. So...</p>
<p><em>I'm the bad person, huh?</em></p>
<p>That's what you get for not eating.</p>
<p>Hey, Cricket!</p>
<p>You know what would make you feel better?</p>
<p><em>What could possibly make me feel better?</p>
<p>You wanna tea-bag Dennis?</em></p>
<p>I'll get the camera!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Polaroid, Polaroid, Polaroid.</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
