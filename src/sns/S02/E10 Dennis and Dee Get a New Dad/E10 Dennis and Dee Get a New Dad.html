<p><em>Hey-o! What is up, bitches?</p>
<p>I'm trying to revamp my MySpace page, but Dennis keeps criticizing...</em> every move that I make.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What in the hell is a MySpace page?</p>
<p>It's, like, that friends forum.</p>
<p>These things are pretty awesome.</p>
<p>You create a profile, put your picture on there... other people send you pictures and want to be your friend.</p>
<p>Oh. So that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. You guys are losers.</p>
<p>How are we losers, dude?</p>
<p>Well, maybe it boils down to this, smart guy.</p>
<p>Computers are for losers.</p>
<p>You're drinking a beer at 8:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><em>Whatever, dude. Irrelevant.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</em></p>
<p>This guy's been trying to contact me for, like, two weeks now... and I've just been blowing him off.</p>
<p>But he's saying that he's our dad.</p>
<p>Awesome. Crazy person.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>No. Not awesome. Because look at the pictures he's sending.</p>
<p><em>Oh! Oh, look at that!</p>
<p>See?</em></p>
<p>That's your mom, dude!</p>
<p>There's, like...</p>
<p>There's, like, a ton of pictures of this guy and your mom.</p>
<p>Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>He does kind of look like you, Dennis.</p>
<p>Don't jump to any conclusions here.</p>
<p>This is bullshit! You guys have two dads, and I don't even have one.</p>
<p>Yeah! That is bullshit!</p>
<p>We don't even have one.</p>
<p>Wh-What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You have a father.</p>
<p>Yeah. But he's in prison.</p>
<p>He's been there my whole life. It doesn't count.</p>
<p>That does count!</p>
<p>I never met my father!</p>
<p>Take it easy, all right?</p>
<p>This guy's not our dad.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>This is really freaking me out.</p>
<p>Look, Dee, this guy can't be our dad.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Is it? Is it any more ridiculous than our dad having brown eyes... black hair and being 4'10"?</p>
<p>This is really a nice place.</p>
<p>It's about time you kids show me some respect.</p>
<p>It doesn't really have anything to do with respect.</p>
<p>We just wanted to take you to a fancy place so that you would behave yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We need to talk to you about something, Dad.</p>
<p>Shoot.</p>
<p>It's kind of disturbing.</p>
<p>You two aren't banging, are you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No! What are you talking about?</p>
<p>That's disgusting.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Stay away from that kind of thing.</p>
<p>No good can come of it. Trust me.</p>
<p><em>That's not what we're here to talk about.</p>
<p>It better not be...</em> because I don't want no... grandkids.</p>
<p>I am not banging my sister.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ! What have I walked into here?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You two aren't having sex together?</p>
<p>No, we're not having sex together.</p>
<p>What the hell is she doing here?</p>
<p>Sit down, please, Mom. Sit.</p>
<p>I am not getting pulled into any sort of perverted sex talk.</p>
<p>It's not perverted.</p>
<p>Banging your sister is perverted, Dennis.</p>
<p>I am not banging my sister!</p>
<p>God!</p>
<p>Can you just sit, please?</p>
<p>Please sit in the chair. Please sit in the chair.</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Barbara.</p>
<p>Your turkey neck is looking exceptionally attractive this evening.</p>
<p>You have turned into a retarded person.</p>
<p>You're a retard.</p>
<p>Can we use some adult language, just for a couple minutes?</p>
<p>Let's get to it. There's this guy Bruce who contacted Dee on MySpace... and he's claiming to be our biological father.</p>
<p>We just wanted to ask the question and just get it out of the way.</p>
<p>Is there a chance that that could be possible?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, Bruce who? Bruce Mathis?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then, yes.</p>
<p>There's a chance this guy could be our father?</p>
<p>No. Yes, he is your father.</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>Do we really have to get into all of this?</p>
<p>My God! Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, we really have to get into all this!</p>
<p>Everybody settle down.</p>
<p>It's not the end of the world.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I met Bruce and we had this little affair, or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Long story short, he got me pregnant, and I had to make a decision.</p>
<p>Seeing as he had no money, I decided that the best thing for everyone... was if I didn't tell Bruce and let your father think that the twins were his.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>End of story?</p>
<p>How could you do that?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. Would you rather I had them aborted?</p>
<p><em>Children, would you like to have been aborted?</p>
<p>I can't believe this.</em></p>
<p>I just can't believe this!</p>
<p>Okay, Dad. Keep your voice down.</p>
<p>You whore!</p>
<p>Keep it down, okay?</p>
<p>Please don't make a scene.</p>
<p>Don't make a scene.</p>
<p>Sit back down.</p>
<p>Oh, no! I'm not gonna make a scene!</p>
<p>I was just told, excuse me... that my horrible, whore wife... has tricked me into raising two bastards... for 30 years, and I'm being asked to not make a scene!</p>
<p>Whoa! Oh, excuse me?</p>
<p>Oh, did you bang my wife? Huh?</p>
<p>Did you bang my whore wife?</p>
<p>Does anybody here have any illegitimate children with my whore wife... that I should know about?</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank!</p>
<p>Jesus! Jesus, Frank!</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank! Jesus, Frank!</p>
<p>Jesus, Frank!</p>
<p>Jes... Oh! Jesus, Frank!</p>
<p>My life is a lie! My life is a lie!</p>
<p>Somebody's got to get stabbed!</p>
<p>Somebody's got to get sta...</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>Sta... Sta...</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p><em>So, Dad.</em></p>
<p>Kind of a funny story.</p>
<p>Turns out my friends got some weird news the other day about their biological father... and it got me to thinking, uh, about maybe, you know, reconnecting with mine.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>And, you know, Charlie never had a father.</p>
<p>And, uh, I thought that maybe the three of us... could all become, like... like, friends or something.</p>
<p>Really? Well, okay.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Maybe I got something for you.</p>
<p>It's a father-son type of thing, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You see, I got a little business I been running in here the last couple of years.</p>
<p>I was thinking of expanding, and I'm gonna need some people on the outside.</p>
<p>Some really badass, tough guys.</p>
<p>I like where you're going with this.</p>
<p>I think you came to the right place.</p>
<p>What do you guys know about... smuggling heroin through your anus?</p>
<p><em>You definitely look good.</p>
<p>That's not what I'm saying.</p>
<p>I just think you need to tuck it in in the back.</p>
<p>In the back?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. You button the top button and then they tuck it in in the back.</p>
<p>It is tucked in the back.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Is it bunchy?</p>
<p>It's not bunchy.</p>
<p>Let me see. That's exactly it.</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>That's gonna impress your dad, right?</p>
<p>It is gonna impress my dad.</p>
<p>You piece of shit!</p>
<p>You no-good piece of shit!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, Frank!</p>
<p>What's going on in here? What happened?</p>
<p>I had a minor stroke. No big deal.</p>
<p>What's with the gun, dude?</p>
<p>I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who fathered my children.</p>
<p>What? By doing MySpace?</p>
<p>Yeah. And I did everything they said to do.</p>
<p>I put a picture, a profile.</p>
<p>The thing won't tell me where the bastard lives.</p>
<p>Did you send him a friend request?</p>
<p>I don't want to be his friend.</p>
<p>I want to shoot him in the face. Can you help me?</p>
<p>No. You...</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. But no killing.</p>
<p>Needs to be killed.</p>
<p>Doesn't need to be killed.</p>
<p>He could take a good ass whupping.</p>
<p>And we're down with that.</p>
<p>Are you crazy?</p>
<p>No, dude!</p>
<p>Give us one second here.</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>This is our opportunity to prove to people that we are to be respected.</p>
<p>No one is more respected than dudes in prison, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what are dudes in prison?</p>
<p>Hard?</p>
<p>Right. This is our chance to get hard.</p>
<p>Okay. I just don't know if this is the best way to get hard.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>This is totally hard.</p>
<p>You want to get hard, don't you?</p>
<p>I want to get hard.</p>
<p>I want to get very, very hard.</p>
<p>Do you want to shove heroin into your ass?</p>
<p>I don't want to shove anything in my ass.</p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity to prove how hard we are and not shove anything into our asses!</p>
<p>What in God's name are you two talking about?</p>
<p><em>Frank, we're in.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Oh, God! This is so weird.</p>
<p>I'm really nervous.</em></p>
<p>I really hope he's not an asshole.</p>
<p>I don't think I can handle two asshole dads.</p>
<p>Are these my beautiful children?</p>
<p>I just... I can't believe what a miracle this is after all these years.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>You know, I loved your mother more than I can say.</p>
<p>And I'm sure she had her reasons, but she never told me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, this whole thing is very strange for all of us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We've got a lot to catch up on.</p>
<p>Yeah. Tell us about yourself.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where to begin, uh...</em></p>
<p>I met your mom here in, uh... in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It was just before I shipped off to Alaska with Greenpeace.</p>
<p>I do a lot of environmental work and work with kids. - Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And we were in Alaska.</p>
<p>And then we went to Africa, to the Sudan.</p>
<p>We... Here.</p>
<p>This... This is my adopted family.</p>
<p><em>Oh.</p>
<p>You adopted them?</p>
<p>Yup. In fact, um...</p>
<p>Huh.</em></p>
<p>Hello. Those are your brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Your family just got a little bigger today.</p>
<p>It sure... It sure did.</p>
<p>You want to know their names?</p>
<p>No. We'll do that later. We'll do that later because it's... it's hard to remember.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p>And anything here, at all times, is yours.</p>
<p>Anything in my life is yours.</p>
<p>These are cool speakers.</p>
<p>Yep. They're yours. Take 'em. Take 'em.</p>
<p>No, no. I was kidding.</p>
<p>It was just a joke, I think.</p>
<p>But if you want them, just...</p>
<p>Uh... Africa.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, Africa.</p>
<p>Right? Sudan.</p>
<p>I went from the Sudan...</p>
<p>I was in Darfur.</p>
<p>We had a water-purification program there.</p>
<p>So much work to be done there.</p>
<p>And then I-I...</p>
<p>I spent a little time in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We were doing a literacy program for women who were resisting the Taliban.</p>
<p>Well, for better or worse, I came back here a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>And I think it was for better, 'cause I'm doing this work... uh, starting some programs for Sacred Cross Hospital, which I think is very promising.</p>
<p>And... ah!</p>
<p>My story is boring. L...</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>What are your passions?</p>
<p>You know, what are you doing with your lives?</p>
<p>There's been a lot of...</p>
<p>Oh, so many things we do.</p>
<p>Phases.</p>
<p>Oh, God. Where do you begin?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something like...</p>
<p>I know. I know. It's...</p>
<p>A lot of different...</p>
<p>Chapters.</p>
<p>Kinds of... kinds of things.</p>
<p>I want to hear anyth...</p>
<p>Just tell me chapter one.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of this kind of stuff, right here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These guys.</p>
<p>A lot of...</p>
<p>These guys are important to us.</p>
<p>I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</p>
<p><em>Son of a piece of shit!</em></p>
<p>Hey, you gotta relax there, Frank.</p>
<p>Seriously, bro.</p>
<p>You're gonna have another stroke.</p>
<p>He won't make me his friend. How am I gonna find him if he won't make me his friend?</p>
<p>Be patient. It's a process.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro. Come on.</p>
<p>It's been days.</p>
<p>I got no friends.</p>
<p>Stop saying that. You have friends.</p>
<p>I got you. I got this guy Tom.</p>
<p>And that crazy woman who claims we had a one-night stand 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Right, yeah. Tom doesn't really count though.</p>
<p>He kind of, like, comes with it.</p>
<p>Screw this! I'm gonna just follow Dennis and Dee around.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, they're gonna bump into this bastard.</p>
<p>And we're gonna just jump him and beat him over the head with a baseball bat!</p>
<p>Frank, come on.</p>
<p>They're gonna see that coming a mile away.</p>
<p>Man, we need to be more devious, more cunning!</p>
<p>Uh, that's not very hard.</p>
<p>That's some weak ass-buster shit, bro.</p>
<p>This bastard destroyed my lineage.</p>
<p>He must be smashed.</p>
<p>We're gonna smash him, friend.</p>
<p>We're gonna smash him good. We know people.</p>
<p>Look, Frank, uh, we know a guy on the inside we can talk to.</p>
<p>He might be willing to help us out with the situation here.</p>
<p>You guys are fast.</p>
<p>I'm proud of you.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p>Okay. Now, here's how it's gonna work.</p>
<p>I'll have a guy meet you in the bathroom in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Now he doesn't mind sifting through the feces, so don't hold back.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, here's the thing about that, Dad.</p>
<p>We don't have anything in our butts.</p>
<p>No. We don't have anything in our butts.</p>
<p>We're working on that.</p>
<p>But we're still hard.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, you should see how hard we're getting.</p>
<p>Oh, we are getting so hard.</p>
<p>It's, like... Whew!</p>
<p>We actually came by 'cause we need your help.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You come to me empty-handed and you want my help?</p>
<p>Yeah. And, look, we are really, really sorry about that, Dad.</p>
<p>But if you could give us some advice on how to handle a certain situation... then we promise we will come back with our butts filled.</p>
<p>Oh, so filled.</p>
<p>So filled for you.</p>
<p>We need to find our friends' father so that we can give him a serious beating.</p>
<p>Oh, we're gonna kick the crap out of this guy.</p>
<p>And check it out.</p>
<p>We can't find him.</p>
<p>All right. All right. Why don't you just follow your friends around for a while?</p>
<p>They're bound to contact him at some point.</p>
<p>When they do, just jump him.</p>
<p>Beat him with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>That's pretty badass.</p>
<p>That could work.</p>
<p><em>Now, you listen to me.</p>
<p>Do not come back here...</em> without anything up those asses!</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Thank you! Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Lupus Association thanks you, and the children thank you.</p>
<p>Oh, saving the kids, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>Those little angels, they're the future.</p>
<p>That's my dad up there.</p>
<p>He put this whole shindig together.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I helped, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, this whole lupus nightmare has gone on long enough... you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes a father has the privilege... of playing a little music with his daughter.</p>
<p>Would you please welcome Deandra Reynolds?</p>
<p>Juvenile Lupus Association.</p>
<p>What a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p>Mac, I got one question for you.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What's the plan again?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I swear, Charlie, you're, like, a retard.</p>
<p>What we're gonna do is we're gonna bash him with the bat when he comes out.</p>
<p>You want to huff some of this glue with me?</p>
<p>No! Put the glue away!</p>
<p>Please. Huff a little with me, dude.</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Fine!</p>
<p>We just need to keep an edge.</p>
<p>We got to stay hard, dude, because you can't do it if...</p>
<p>This is Elmer's glue, for Christ sakes, Charlie!</p>
<p>Do you have the camera?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got the camera!</p>
<p>I just don't know what it's for, Mac!</p>
<p>I'm gonna bash you with this!</p>
<p>When he comes out, I'm gonna smash his face.</p>
<p>You're gonna take a picture.</p>
<p>We're gonna show it to my dad...</p>
<p>Show it to your dad.</p>
<p>To prove how hard we are!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Oww!</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>No, dude. We shouldn't do this.</p>
<p>I'm backing out.</p>
<p>You can't back out.</p>
<p>Frank is waiting in the car.</p>
<p>He's gonna be pissed if we don't finish the job.</p>
<p>Let Frank wait in the car.</p>
<p>We owe this to him.</p>
<p>This guy banged Frank's wife.</p>
<p>So did you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's different.</p>
<p>How is that different?</p>
<p>I don't know, Charlie! Focus!</p>
<p><em>There they are.</p>
<p>Just relax, dude.</em></p>
<p>He's hugging them.</p>
<p>They're hugging him back!</p>
<p><em>This is crazy. We shouldn't do this.</p>
<p>We should bash all three.</p>
<p>This is it. Let's go.</p>
<p>You ready? Don't be a pussy.</em></p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Oh. Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>It's... It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Have a good night.</p>
<p>What the hell was that shit?</p>
<p>What did you do?</p>
<p>I freaked out.</p>
<p>You totally freaked out! You just left me...</p>
<p>I was gonna hit him.</p>
<p>You left me standing there. I took a picture of the guy.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Snap out of it! Okay?</p>
<p>Okay! Yes.</p>
<p>Now we got to think of something to tell Frank.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey! Look at me.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Let's tell him the truth.</p>
<p>Let's tell him the truth.</p>
<p>Blood! Blood! There's so much blood!</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>We bashed him good!</p>
<p>We bashed him so good!</p>
<p>We bashed him good!</p>
<p>I think we killed him.</p>
<p>Drive! Drive! Drive!</p>
<p><em>Jesus, children! This isn't exactly what Mommy needs right now.</em></p>
<p>No. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Mom, Bruce is so awesome. He...</p>
<p>We had the best time last night.</p>
<p>Bruce is the coolest.</p>
<p>We went to this lupus event last night. Lupus is awesome!</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p><em>You should give Bruce another chance.</p>
<p>Barbara.</p>
<p>My God. You still look amazing.</p>
<p>Wow.</em></p>
<p>The years have treated you well.</p>
<p><em>I would have thought living in poverty for a quarter of a century...</em> would have taken its toll.</p>
<p>Well, when Father died, I was left with all that money.</p>
<p>There's only so much you can give away before you finally realize... it's okay to spend a little on yourself.</p>
<p><em>On you.</p>
<p>Yeah, on me.</em></p>
<p>Father? Wealthy?</p>
<p>I never knew.</p>
<p>I guess it never came up.</p>
<p>So you guys ready?</p>
<p>I am!</p>
<p>I'm up for anything.</p>
<p>Okay. But first things first.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's just put these on.</p>
<p>One for you.</p>
<p>One for me.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><em>Okay, let's go spread somejoy.</em></p>
<p>Right. Uh...</p>
<p>Ooh. Okay. Um, hey.</p>
<p>Hey, pal.</p>
<p>How... How you feeling?</p>
<p>It hurts everywhere.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Well, it... Everything's gonna be okay.</p>
<p>You don't know that, Deandra.</p>
<p>Shut up, Mother.</p>
<p>I don't think we should be lying to the sick children.</p>
<p>I was trying to be encouraging.</p>
<p>What if he doesn't get better? You're gonna look like a fool.</p>
<p>I gotta say I agree with Dee. The kid's gonna die anyway. What difference does it make?</p>
<p>I can hear you.</p>
<p>Oh, you heard...</p>
<p>Well, you know what? Disregard that.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, we weren't even talking about you.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>We were talking about your sick and dying friend in the next bed.</p>
<p>Mother! What are you doing?</p>
<p>Nothing!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You can't steal the children's medication.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p><em>Let me see in your purse! Open your purse up!</p>
<p>Don't be ridiculous!</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Everything okay over here?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A slight glitch here.</p>
<p>Um, this is really kind of bumming me out here.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is not fun.</p>
<p>Yes. I'm not exactly sure what it is we're trying to prove.</p>
<p>We're not trying to prove anything.</p>
<p>We're just helping the kids.</p>
<p>Who are we really helping?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean.</p>
<p>Well, listen, it's one thing to rock out, raise some cash.</p>
<p>But it's a totally different thing to put our lives at risk.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I mean, there's all these diseases floating around in here.</p>
<p>Yes. I mean, how can we help anyone if we're all getting sick?</p>
<p>I mean, use your head.</p>
<p>Plus, it's freezing in here.</p>
<p>You think you could talk to somebody about cranking the heat up a little?</p>
<p>This isn't good for us.</p>
<p>You're not serious?</p>
<p>I don't think it's a lot to ask to have them turn the temperature up.</p>
<p>It's easy. You just push a button or, like, crank a thing over.</p>
<p>Are you guys getting hungry?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>I am starving.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could eat.</p>
<p>Is there a cafeteria in the hospital?</p>
<p>No, come on. Gross.</p>
<p>I'm not eating in a hospital cafeteria.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>Brucie, do you know a nice restaurant in the area?</p>
<p>I'm gonna want those noses back.</p>
<p>Please. Give it a rest with that martyr nonsense.</p>
<p>Yeah. Who is he? Patch Adams?</p>
<p>You know who never acts like he cares about kids?</p>
<p>Dad.</p>
<p>Dad.</p>
<p><em>All right, buddy.</p>
<p>Baking soda, lube, balloons.</em></p>
<p>This is how it's gonna go.</p>
<p>I'm gonna jam this into your rectum.</p>
<p>And then, woo! Like that, it's gonna expand in your colon, okay?</p>
<p>It's gonna be that big?</p>
<p>Absolutely. You ready? Drop those pants.</p>
<p><em>Hey, guys. What do you think?</p>
<p>That's a good look. That's a good look for you.</p>
<p>Where're you headed?</em></p>
<p>I tell you what, I feel like a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Ever since you guys beat that guy up, I got to thinking. Hey, what am I gonna do? Huh?</p>
<p>Dive into some kind of depression over this? No.</p>
<p>I'm gonna jump right back on the horse.</p>
<p>So I contacted that woman on MySpace who claimed that we had a one-night stand.</p>
<p>Turns out she's single and ready to go.</p>
<p>Give me some skin.</p>
<p>Good work.</p>
<p><em>There you go, Frankie!</em></p>
<p>That might be her. Mac, get the door.</p>
<p>Let me clean this up.</p>
<p><em>Hide that balloon.</p>
<p>That's gonna kill your date.</em></p>
<p>Where's my dad?</p>
<p>So he's your dad now...</p>
<p>Get out of the way.</p>
<p>Daddy.</p>
<p>Don't Daddy me. You blew your chances with this daddy. You're dead to me.</p>
<p><em>No. Just listen for a second here, okay?</p>
<p>No. No.</em></p>
<p>We've had a change of heart.</p>
<p>We've decided to forgive you... and to allow you to be our father again.</p>
<p>I'm not into being your dad anymore.</p>
<p>Don't want to be your dad.</p>
<p>Uh, kinda giving you a second chance here, Dad.</p>
<p>Daddy, yeah.</p>
<p>No. I'm over it.</p>
<p>You can't be over it.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I'm over it.</em></p>
<p>He can be over it.</p>
<p>Will you shut up? What is with you two?</p>
<p>I am over over over it!</p>
<p>You're not allowed to be over it!</p>
<p><em>I can yell at him!</em></p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Hey, Mom.</p>
<p>What... What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm confused. Do you live here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bonnie?</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>How do you guys know each other?</p>
<p><em>This is my date.</p>
<p>Whoa! Wait a second. I thought...</em> you were going on a date with a woman you had a one-night stand with 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you guys had a one-night stand 30 years ago, and I don't...</p>
<p>You know, I don't know who my... father...</p>
<p>You could be my...</p>
<p>Dad?</p>
