<p>What?</p>
<p>Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Frank sent me over to pick up his toupee.</p>
<p>His toupee?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>What does he need his toupee for?</p>
<p>I think he has a date.</p>
<p>Frank has a date?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>Well, he can't have it. It's mine.</p>
<p>You own his hair?</p>
<p>All right, fine. It's in a box in the hallway.</p>
<p>I was gonna throw it away anyway.</p>
<p>So I'm really sorry about this.</p>
<p>I know it's probably a tough time for you.</p>
<p>Divorce is a tricky thing.</p>
<p>Oh! I found it.</p>
<p>I got the hair now.</p>
<p>Found the hair.</p>
<p>So I guess I'll just, uh, see myself out.</p>
<p>Right. Thank you for the hair.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p><em>Wait till you see the hair.</em></p>
<p>This is really authentic-looking hair.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p><em>So how do you know this chick, anyway?</p>
<p>Angie Spinola...</em></p>
<p>High school. Firecracker.</p>
<p>Hung out all the time.</p>
<p><em>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We did everything together.</em></p>
<p>Wild sex. Whoa!</p>
<p>I mean... You name it, we did it.</p>
<p>Well, she sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah. They don't make women like Angie anymore.</p>
<p>Tell you that right now.</p>
<p>Charlie, you gonna be okay, I leave you alone at the bar here?</p>
<p>I think things have been going pretty well since you put me in charge, Frank.</p>
<p>Right. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<p>What are you?</p>
<p>Why? Why would a person wipe their own shit onto a wall?</p>
<p><em>I don't know.</em></p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I thought you were cleaning the toilet.</p>
<p>What? Cleaning toilet?</p>
<p>No, that's what Charlie does.</p>
<p>I'm not doing Charlie work anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, Dad said we need to, so get back in there and clean the stall.</p>
<p>Dee, Dee... Will you take it easy?</p>
<p>I got a little plan to get us out of it.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, God, that's good news. What is it?</p>
<p>Well, let's just say I got a little date tonight... and as soon as Charlie sees who it is... no more Charlie work for me.</p>
<p>How does that help me?</p>
<p>I guess it doesn't, really.</p>
<p>Mm-mmm. It sure doesn't.</p>
<p>You know, you should come up with a plan just like I did... and then you can get out of Charlie work too.</p>
<p><em>Oh, you think I can't come up with a plan?</p>
<p>Hey!</em></p>
<p>Dennis, hey.</p>
<p>Got something for you.</p>
<p>What? Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow! Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>That's really nice.</p>
<p>Can I take your coat?</p>
<p>Uh, are we staying here?</p>
<p>No, no. I just want to have a look at what you're wearing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So... what do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. That'll work.</p>
<p>Are you not wearing makeup?</p>
<p>I'm wearing makeup.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have any more?</p>
<p>No. I didn't bring makeup.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Uh, okay. That's all right.</p>
<p>Let's go say good night to Charlie. Come on.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't think that's such a good idea.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no. He's totally fine with the situation.</p>
<p>It's cool. Come on.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, buddy.</p>
<p>Please knock if you're gonna be coming into my off...</p>
<p>What ya doin'?</p>
<p><em>Uh, I was doing some office stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</em></p>
<p>Well, listen, uh, we are gonna hit the town... so we just wanted to pop back and say good night.</p>
<p>Looks like you got everything under control back here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>That's a nice house of cards, Charlie.</p>
<p>Actually, no. I was doing some business stuff'cause I'm the manager now.</p>
<p>Great. Well, we're out of here.</p>
<p>Don't work too hard, okay, bud?</p>
<p>Good night, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, good night.</p>
<p><em>Could you, uh, give me one second?</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Okay, listen. Here's the deal.</p>
<p>I'm gonna bang her tonight, probably around 10:30 or so.</p>
<p>Now, I really don't wanna do that... so all you have to do to stop me is call my cell phone... by 10:30... and say, "Dennis, you don't have to do Charlie work anymore."</p>
<p>You're not gonna get away with this.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I will.</p>
<p>I'll get away with it. 10:30, okay?</p>
<p>10:30.</p>
<p>Gonna blackmail me?</p>
<p>You gonna blackmail me, Dennis Reynolds?</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>I'm ready. Let's roll.</p>
<p>Hey-o! What's up, buddy?</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>It's your dad's hair.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>Yeah. Is Charlie here?</p>
<p>Yeah, man. What's up with you?</p>
<p>You seem flustered.</p>
<p>Is Charlie...</p>
<p>He's in the back office.</p>
<p>I wanna talk to him.</p>
<p>Okay. Go talk to him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great. Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh... Bye, Dennis.</p>
<p>See ya.</p>
<p>Charlie, I have a real dilemma on my hands.</p>
<p>Normally I would never talk to you about these things because you're so unreliable... but Dennis, Dee and Frank are all directly involved, and I gotta tell somebody, man.</p>
<p>I am bustin'. Okay...</p>
<p>Dennis's mom tried to have sex with me.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, she got naked, she came on to me...</p>
<p>That woman is straight crazy, but I think I wanna bang her. I know I shouldn't do it...</p>
<p>I think you should do it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>An opportunity like this only comes around once in a lifetime, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You'd be a fool to let it slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what I'm thinkin', but it's Dennis and Dee's mom.</p>
<p>Well, that means that no one ever, ever is gonna find out.</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to make sense.</p>
<p>You're right. I'm gonna do it.</p>
<p><em>Okay. Okay. Oh, this is good.</p>
<p>This is good.</em></p>
<p>Oh, this is good.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh... I gotta meet Frank.</p>
<p>I gotta give him his hair.</p>
<p>You go, 'cause I gotta plot, and I gotta think.</p>
<p><em>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Get out of here. Go. God, this is good!</em></p>
<p>Dennis's mom. Yes, he is. I'm busy.</p>
<p>I want my job back.</p>
<p>Look, I'm... What?</p>
<p>I want my job back.</p>
<p>Well, I'm...</p>
<p>And you shall have it.</p>
<p>Oh, Dee. It looks like we both need things from each other.</p>
<p>I am not having sex with you, Charlie.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It's not sex I want from you.</p>
<p>It's sex I don't want from Dennis.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Mmm. So you gotta tell me about all the shit you been gettin' into.</p>
<p>You must have a police record a mile long.</p>
<p>Oh, God. No.</p>
<p>Don't be modest now. You remember all the shit we used to get into?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>You remember that night in the graveyard?</p>
<p>How could I forget?</p>
<p>That slab was cold, baby.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>And remember the time we robbed a motorcycle and ran it into the river?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, you must be doin' shit like that now, huh? Come on.</p>
<p>Well, I've slowed down quite a bit once I met my husband, Carl.</p>
<p>Oh, you told me you weren't married.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm not. Carl passed a few years ago.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Once I met him and had kids, I pretty much stayed at home.</p>
<p>Carl had two children from a previous marriage... and then we had five of our own.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Jenny.</p>
<p>I'll be your server this evening.</p>
<p><em>Are you ready to order, or do you need some more time?</em></p>
<p>I think we need just a little more time.</p>
<p>I'll be back in a second.</p>
<p><em>Isn't having children a blessing?</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Isn't having children such a blessing?</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, when Carl passed, my children were an enormous source of strength.</p>
<p><em>I mean, I thought...</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.</em></p>
<p>Angie, I'm gonna have to stop you.</p>
<p><em>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>This is not gonna work out.</em></p>
<p>What's not going to work out?</p>
<p>You, me, talking like this.</p>
<p>Why? What's wrong?</p>
<p>For starters, you've got kids and shit.</p>
<p>And you talk about 'em.</p>
<p>You talk about your kids, you talk about your dead husband.</p>
<p>I mean, it's kind of bummin' me out.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. It's just, maybe...</p>
<p>I think you're too old for me.</p>
<p>Frank, I'm two years younger than you.</p>
<p>That's what I'm talkin' about.</p>
<p>I had a really good time tonight.</p>
<p>I had a good time too.</p>
<p>Okay, what's the deal with that?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why do you keep checking your cell phone?</p>
<p>I've just been... I've been expecting an important phone call.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>No. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Don't... Don't go. I wanna go inside.</p>
<p>No. I'm not gonna ask you inside, Dennis.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because I really... like you.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. I mean...</p>
<p>I really like you too.</p>
<p>Then let's just take it slow, okay?</p>
<p>Oh-Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>I... love you.</p>
<p>L...</p>
<p>I kind of don't know what to say.</p>
<p>I kind of don't want you to say anything.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, hold that thought.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
<p>I'm ready to talk.</p>
<p>Cuttin' it pretty close there, pal.</p>
<p>I almost sealed the deal.</p>
<p>Just meet me at Paddy's and we'll work it all out.</p>
<p>Sorry about, uh...</p>
<p>I feel like maybe I was being a little judgmental.</p>
<p>You're good.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, let's go.</p>
<p>No. You were right.</p>
<p>I should... I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm gonna go now.</p>
<p>We should take it slow.</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Really? Because I... don't need to now.</p>
<p>I think it's good.</p>
<p>I think it's real good.</p>
<p>Call me.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>You called just in the nick of time, buddy. I was...</p>
<p>Looks like we got a blown fuse in here.</p>
<p>Better get on that.</p>
<p>Blown fuses count as Charlie work.</p>
<p><em>Oh, I don't think I'll be changing any fuses any time soon.</em></p>
<p>I know something you don't know.</p>
<p>That was, like, the best sex I've ever had, Mrs. Reynolds.</p>
<p>Like something magical happened.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>I was just saying that that was, like, so special... and, I mean, it was like magic.</p>
<p>You're not gonna start talking about your feelings and shit, are you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Gay.</p>
<p>No. It's just that...</p>
<p>I mean, unless you want to, 'cause...</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>I got a better plan.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Uh, so can I call you sometime?</p>
<p>I have your number, right?</p>
<p>No, I don't think so.</p>
<p>I know how to find you.</p>
<p>Why don't we leave it at that?</p>
<p>Wh... All right. Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p>I mean, was the sex bad?</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I can make adjustments...</p>
<p>'Cause I've had to do that before, and it hasn't been a problem.</p>
<p>I'm shutting the door now.</p>
<p>Well, if I could just have a kiss good-bye... that would be... really great for me.</p>
<p>If I gave you a kiss good-bye, would you let go of the door?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Oh!</p>
<p>Yeah. It's a terrible thing.</p>
<p>It's a terrible thing for you to see that.</p>
<p>I'm gonna kill him.</p>
<p>No... I'm gonna kill him!</p>
<p>No. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do, punch him in the face? Throw him?</p>
<p>Work the body a little?</p>
<p>No, no, it's not gonna help. I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>It doesn't "un-bang" your mom.</p>
<p>No, you gotta do something worse...</p>
<p>Something much, much worse.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to bang Mac's mom.</p>
<p>I thought I was.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm looking for Mrs. Mac. Is she in?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm a friend of her son's.</p>
<p>I know you, Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It's been a long time. Haven't seen you in a while. You look different.</p>
<p><em>I gained a little weight.</p>
<p>Is that what it is?</p>
<p>Looks good on you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Do you mind if I sit?</p>
<p>So. Watching a little TV outside, huh?</p>
<p>I like the fresh air.</p>
<p>Probably gets a little lonely though every once in a while... watching TV out here by yourself.</p>
<p>Every once in a while you probably want a man, right?</p>
<p>Someone to fulfill your desires.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Not interested.</p>
<p>Don't fight it, Mrs. Mac.</p>
<p>Why don't we go inside and have a little fun?</p>
<p>Don't find you attractive.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I think you're an ugly man.</p>
<p>You think I'm ugly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm not ugly. You're ugly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ. What is wrong with you, woman?</p>
<p>You're saying that I'm un...</p>
<p>You don't find me attractive?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And you're... What? Not gonna have sex with me?</p>
<p><em>No.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous. I'm... I'm out of here.</em></p>
<p>Wait. What... What just happened?</p>
<p>I think you know exactly what just happened.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, come on. He did not try to have sex with that woman.</p>
<p>Oh, he did, 'cause he's a dirty, dirty pervert.</p>
<p>I'm... I'm so confused right now.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Are you? I can help you. Don't trust him.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p><em>Uh-oh. Excuse me.</em></p>
<p>I need to get this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can you pop out real quick?</p>
<p><em>Really?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. It's personal.</p>
<p>You don't want to be rude, so...</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How we doin'?</p>
<p>Cat's in the cradle.</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>Time to move to phase two.</p>
<p>There is no phase two.</p>
<p>I'm not doing phase two.</p>
<p>I did everything you said. It's over.</p>
<p>This isn't over until I say it's over!</p>
<p>God. Sorry. Okay.</p>
<p>Relax, dude. One more phase. That's it.</p>
<p><em>This is Barbara. Leave a message.</em></p>
<p>Hey, uh... Not answering my calls.</p>
<p>I get it. You're busy. You're busy.</p>
<p>It's a busy time of the week.</p>
<p>Um, listen, I think you should give me a call back because I know what you're afraid of.</p>
<p>You think Frank and Dennis are gonna find out, but they're not, okay?</p>
<p>I'm gonna keep my mouth shut on this one.</p>
<p>And I know that you know that the sex was good, right?</p>
<p><em>So I think maybe we should...</em></p>
<p>There's somebody at the door. I'm just gonna ignore it.</p>
<p><em>I think that maybe we should get together...</em></p>
<p>Oh, they sound pissed. All right, listen.</p>
<p>I'll give you a call back.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let's go for a ride.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Grab your coat.</p>
<p>We're goin' for a ride.</p>
<p>Are you going to kill me?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No. I just wanna go out and pick up some younger chicks... and I need a wing man for that.</p>
<p>Come on. Let's roll.</p>
<p><em>How about the two out there on the dance floor?</em></p>
<p>Go on. Go on, break the ice.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, man.</p>
<p>Come on, man. Go. Go.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Hey, how ya doin'? I like your top.</p>
<p>Lookin' good. Mac.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Frank.</p>
<p>Wanna get down? Huh?</p>
<p>What happened? What did you do?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, what did I do?</p>
<p>What was with that little move?</p>
<p>That move always works with the ladies.</p>
<p>Frank, you have never gotten a chick with that move.</p>
<p>What are you talkin' about? That's how I got my wife.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. So don't go blamin' the move.</p>
<p>The move works.</p>
<p>So, uh, what other kind of things worked on your wife?</p>
<p>She likes money.</p>
<p>So she likes money and dancing.</p>
<p>Can we stop talking about my wife for a second here?</p>
<p>You're killin' the vibe.</p>
<p>Let me see now.</p>
<p><em>Over there. Try the move.</em></p>
<p>You hang over here, this side, while I...</p>
<p>Hello, hello, hello.</p>
<p>I'm Frank. Remember?</p>
<p>Where'd he go? Mac!</p>
<p><em>Go away.</em></p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>Dee, now's not a good time.</p>
<p>Charlie is making me have sex with him to get out of Charlie work.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. Really gross.</p>
<p>Am I the only one around here who's not getting laid?</p>
<p>Dennis, Charlie is forcing me to have sex with him.</p>
<p>Mac's getting laid.</p>
<p>You're getting laid.</p>
<p>Now even Charlie's getting laid?</p>
<p>This makes me look terrible.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>This is all Charlie's fault.</p>
<p>None of this would be happening if Dad didn't put him in charge.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p><em>I'm gonna kill him.</p>
<p>No, no. Whoa.</em></p>
<p>You ought to do something worse than that... Something much, much worse.</p>
<p>Oh! Hello, Dennis.</p>
<p>Hello, Mrs. Kelly.</p>
<p><em>You look wonderful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</em></p>
<p>Oh. Oh, my!</p>
<p>Well, uh, it's good to see you, Dennis.</p>
<p>What brings you by?</p>
<p>I wanted to bring you some chocolates.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I come in?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>That son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>No! No, he said he loved me.</p>
<p>How dare he do that?</p>
<p>I'm gonna stab him.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I'm gonna stab his face off.</p>
<p>No. No, stabbing's bad.</p>
<p>You need to do something worse...</p>
<p>Something much, much worse.</p>
<p>You gotta sleep with Charlie.</p>
<p>Shh. Shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sweetie.</p>
<p>I just don't find you sexually attractive.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>You don't find me sexually attractive?</p>
<p>What in the hell is going on?</p>
<p>What is wrong with you people?</p>
<p>I am sexually a...</p>
<p>I am sexually attractive.</p>
<p>I am an attractive... man.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>$443.</p>
<p>Listen, Mac, let's just end this right now.</p>
<p>I only slept with you to piss Frank off.</p>
<p>Afterward I felt like I was gonna throw up.</p>
<p>So Frank makes you want to throw up?</p>
<p>No. You're not listening.</p>
<p>It's you that makes me want to throw up.</p>
<p>Oh. So you don't want to be my girlfriend anymore?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Wait a second. Hold on.</p>
<p>Wait! I'm confused. So you don't want to be my girlfriend anymore?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>No, Mac, it's okay. It's all right.</p>
<p>Listen, uh...</p>
<p>Okay, let me explain.</p>
<p>Just let me explain.</p>
<p>No, no. I understand, okay?</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah. Look, I... I think I know how you're feeling.</p>
<p>Oh, man. That is such a relief.</p>
<p>Check this out. L...</p>
<p>You've done well.</p>
<p>Thank you...</p>
<p>And your date with the waitress is all set up.</p>
<p>Oh! Mmm! That is so wonderful.</p>
<p>I have to ask you though...</p>
<p>How did you know that your mom wasn't gonna sleep with Dennis?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Guess I kind of overlooked that detail.</p>
<p>Okay, time for phase three, Dee.</p>
<p>No, Charlie. You said there were only two phases.</p>
<p>This one's easy.</p>
<p>Okay. Phase three complete.</p>
<p>It looks good?</p>
<p>You look really good.</p>
<p>You sure?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You're all done?</p>
<p>I'm all done. You look great.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping me out.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>The waitress is gonna be here soon.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go back to bartending, and you will go back to handling poo-poo.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Phase four...</p>
<p>No! No.</p>
<p>I got a quick phase four.</p>
<p>Charlie...</p>
<p>Let me squeak a phase four in.</p>
<p>I won't... You can't...</p>
<p>There's no squeaking of phase... No. No.</p>
<p>Okay, fine!</p>
<p>It's over. Okay?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You are hereby released of all Charlie work.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, uh, can you do me a favor and not get too drunk?</p>
<p>All right? 'Cause I got some kegs that I need changing.</p>
<p>Uh, there's, like... You know what?</p>
<p>There's some rats down in the rattraps.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hello, gang!</p>
<p>You're lookin' at the new Frank.</p>
<p>Ooh!</p>
<p>What the hell is she doing here?</p>
<p>"What the hell is she doing here?" Really?</p>
<p><em>Really. I'll tell you what I'm doing here.</em></p>
<p>You wanna know what I'm doing here, shit-for-brains?</p>
<p>I had sex with your dad.</p>
<p>That's right, I had sex with your father...</p>
<p><em>because, just like you, I like my sex old and ugly.</em></p>
<p>And with fake hair on their heads that falls off when you're having sex with 'em.</p>
<p>It just falls off because that's what you do, Dennis Reynolds.</p>
<p>You like to have sex with old people.</p>
<p><em>And you said that you loved me!</p>
<p>You said, "I love you,"and so I thought, "Okay, I love you too."</p>
<p>How do you show love?</p>
<p>You go and have sex with old people.</p>
<p>So that's what I did too!</em></p>
