<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I just... I can't believe you just bought, like, another ridiculous ugly car.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: You are lucky I am letting you into my goddamn...</p>
<p>Oh, shit, okay, okay, here she comes, here she comes.</p>
<p>Okay, see, what is she doing?</p>
<p>She appears to be delivering food.</p>
<p>No. That's not what I'm saying-- I know that.</p>
<p>She's actually delivering Indian food now-- it's a good gig.</p>
<p>But I mean, why is she not locking up her bike?</p>
<p>This is a bad neighborhood.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Okay, look at this guy.</p>
<p>He's totally gonna steal it.</p>
<p>I got to move.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>(Charlie barking)</p>
<p>Keep it moving, guy!</p>
<p>(barking)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>You're just leaving your bike unlocked?</p>
<p>I'm protecting it so it doesn't get stolen!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm done.</p>
<p>I am so done with this.</p>
<p>You need to stop stalking me.</p>
<p>You need to leave me alone.</p>
<p>Look... do you have any idea what a mess your life would be if I wasn't always helping you out?</p>
<p>I keep a list.</p>
<p>I keep a list of things that I do, okay?</p>
<p>I watch your bike so it doesn't get stolen, okay?</p>
<p>I put, uh... I put vitamins in your shampoo so your hair doesn't fall out.</p>
<p>I test your food so it doesn't get poisoned.</p>
<p>Charlie! Listen to me.</p>
<p>I am finished.</p>
<p>Stop following me.</p>
<p>Do you want me to be happy?</p>
<p>Do you want me to be happy?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Then stop being around every time I turn around!</p>
<p>You have to leave me alone!</p>
<p>You want me to be, like, gone forever?</p>
<p>Yes. Do you hear me?</p>
<p>Yeah, I hear you. It's... Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is good-bye?</p>
<p>Yeah. Good-bye, I guess.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, good. Thank you.</p>
<p>Bye. Goddamn.</p>
<p>(laughing): Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, she slammed you, huh?</p>
<p>Do you want to follow her around some more?</p>
<p>Nah, whatever, she's, like... she's right, you know?</p>
<p>Can we just go back to the bar, Dee?</p>
<p>Mm, no, I'd like to follow her around.</p>
<p>(tires screech)</p>
<p>Uh... goddamn it!</p>
<p>If you don't have car insurance, you better have dental because I am gonna smash your teeth into dust!</p>
<p><strong>Trevor</strong>: So sorry, that was completely my fault.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's goddamn your fault, I...</p>
<p>Oh... look at you. My God.</p>
<p>I'm Trevor.</p>
<p>This is my sister Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>(all chuckle)</p>
<p>Oh, geez.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee gags)</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No. I don't understand.</p>
<p>None of this is making any sense.</p>
<p>Dude... what is not to understand, okay?</p>
<p>We got in an accident, right?</p>
<p>They felt a little bad about it, one thing led to another, they asked us out to, like, a dinner date.</p>
<p>Who are these people exactly?</p>
<p>Trevor and Ruby Taft. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you mean "Taft"?</p>
<p>Like... the Taft family?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, Taft family, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's a good get, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm rich, but these people are in the stratosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah, my whole family was a Taft family.</p>
<p>My uncles and grandfathers and cousins all worked for TaftCo Enterprises.</p>
<p>My uncle even drowned in a vat of their molten steel.</p>
<p>He didn't drown, he burned up.</p>
<p>Yeah, he probably burned.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't think he drowned.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a great opportunity, okay?</p>
<p>Do not screw this up, because if you get into a family like this, it's like becoming royalty.</p>
<p>What's the plan for the date?</p>
<p>The... I mean, no plans.</p>
<p>We were just gonna be ourselves.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Don't.</p>
<p>Do not be yourself.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that's terrible.</p>
<p>Be anybody but yourselves.</p>
<p>Anybody!</p>
<p>Charlie, do not eat any cheese or any cheese-like substances, okay?</p>
<p>If you see any cheese, you run away from it!</p>
<p>Dee, do not be a drunk, punchy whore, okay, you whore?</p>
<p>But... No, there's no buts!</p>
<p>There's no buts.</p>
<p>Do not screw this up for me-- for you... for all of us.</p>
<p>What is the plan for the date?</p>
<p>I guess we'll become one of them or something.</p>
<p>Now, uh, as I understand it, your family came over on the Mayflower?</p>
<p>Um, yes, they can actually be traced back to the original settlement.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Well, I imagine they destroyed many an Indian.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>I too sort of have distaste for the Indians, you know?</p>
<p>They're savage things.</p>
<p>They're nasty, really.</p>
<p>Right, right, they needed to be exterminated.</p>
<p>I mean, you hate to say it, but...</p>
<p>You do hate to, but it's the truth.</p>
<p>So congratulations to your family.</p>
<p>Uh, my family, uh, we were... we were a railroad family.</p>
<p>That's right, the Vandervelts were a distant relative.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and I, too, am of a large... um, money-ful family.</p>
<p>He, too.</p>
<p>Shippers of-of goods and, uh...</p>
<p>Services.</p>
<p>Builders of... tall... Buildings.</p>
<p>Would anyone like a drink?</p>
<p>A drink? No, thank you.</p>
<p>No, thank you, never will I drink.</p>
<p>Whoop! Mm... (chuckles)</p>
<p>It's all right.</p>
<p>That's all right.</p>
<p>Is he all right?</p>
<p>(Charlie groans)</p>
<p>(forced laughter)</p>
<p>Just talk about a different...</p>
<p>I can ignore the cheese.</p>
<p>It's not... I'm sorry, I can't do it!</p>
<p>All right, then screw it.</p>
<p>'Cause I've been eying this guy all night long.</p>
<p>Excuse me, oh!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>We've been putting on airs.</p>
<p>I know I come across, like, super fancy.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>We're not the blue blood fancy types that you think that we are.</p>
<p>Thank God!</p>
<p>We thought we made a huge mistake.</p>
<p>We like you guys 'cause you aren't anything like the people that we know.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, that is such a relief because look at this pit stain.</p>
<p>I mean, we're, like, totally, like, normal.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sweating like...</p>
<p>You like this pit stain?</p>
<p>That's nasty, yo!</p>
<p>I've got bodily functions, I'm sorry!</p>
<p>Hey, guys, can we do some shots?</p>
<p>Yes! I would love to do some shots.</p>
<p>Right, see, we're getting after it now!</p>
<p>We're getting after it!</p>
<p>No, no, see, this doesn't add up.</p>
<p>This does not make any sense.</p>
<p>Why is this going well?</p>
<p>Can the girl not smell Charlie?</p>
<p>Can the guy not see Dee?</p>
<p>Something's fishy.</p>
<p>Dennis, don't poke holes in this, okay?</p>
<p>This is like Lady Di being plucked from the streets like the trash she was and the trash that Charlie and Dee are.</p>
<p>No, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I know what's going on here, guys.</p>
<p>Now this makes sense.</p>
<p>See, I know what's happening here.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>Dangerous Liaisons.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>The movie.</p>
<p>I don't know that movie.</em></p>
<p>It was like-like <em>Cruel Intentions.</p>
<p>She's All That?</p>
<p>Can't Buy Me Love?</p>
<p>Almost any movie made in the late '90s?</p>
<p>Guys, guys, these are the games that rich people with nothing but time on their hands play with people that they perceive to be below them.</p>
<p>That girl is just toying with Charlie.</p>
<p>She's gonna crush him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hate to say it, but I think you're right.</p>
<p>What about Dee?</p>
<p>What, Dee?</p>
<p>No, she's constantly being crushed.</p>
<p>She'll bounce back, she always does.</p>
<p>Or she won't. It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I don't care about that.</p>
<p>All I care about is Charlie here.</p>
<p>Now, guys, we got to dig a little deeper.</em></p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Ooh! Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh, look at this.</p>
<p>Look at this. Shall we?</p>
<p>You're going.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, you guys are going, right?</p>
<p>No. Get in the car and leave.</p>
<p>No, we' c Ping with.</p>
<p>Don't glom onto this.</p>
<p>Hi, you guys.</p>
<p>Hey, you brought some friends.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No. No, not friends. Hobos.</p>
<p>Yeah. Come on in. The more, the merrier.</p>
<p>You guys up for some tennis?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah. You got booze?</p>
<p>You got food?</p>
<p>You got stuff to eat?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>(Dennis grunts)</p>
<p>All right, Frank, I'll play on Ruby's team, and over the course of the game, I'll subtly extract her plan to humiliate Charlie.</p>
<p>I'll get her.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I will definitely have her.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, Dennis, you're not gonna hit on her, right?</p>
<p>Huh? No, no.</p>
<p>Look, you sounded like you were gonna try to bang her.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna hit on her, okay?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna try and bang her.</p>
<p>Don't. Don't do it.</p>
<p>Just, will you trust me?</p>
<p>(Dennis grunts)</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Come on! Come on, Frank!</p>
<p>Oh, hey, stay on that side when the ball comes to you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ball!</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>Hey, yo, Ruby.</p>
<p>Time out, time out.</p>
<p>Let's take a little break.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Let's take a little breather.</p>
<p>I thought you said you were good at this.</p>
<p>I am good.</p>
<p>It's just, you know, this shirt is, like, ridiculously-tight, and it's restricting my play, so, I think I'm just gonna pop it off.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
<p>About what?</p>
<p>What I'm presenting you.</p>
<p>I think you look really pale.</p>
<p>Do you need some sunscreen?</p>
<p>Well, it's the first of the season.</p>
<p>I haven't had a chance to get a base going, you know...?</p>
<p>Dennis? Dennis?</p>
<p>What do you think of the pecs?</p>
<p>What do you think of...?</p>
<p>Dennis?!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Come here!</p>
<p>Give me a second, all right?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I thought you said you weren't gonna hit on her.</p>
<p>Am I hitting on her?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Okay.</p>
<p>No, you're right.</p>
<p>Okay, I went into default mode.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Hey, do I look pale?</p>

<p>♪ Company, always on the run Destiny is the rising sun... ♪</p>
<p>What the hell is she doing?!</p>
<p>She's gonna ruin this whole thing!</p>
<p>♪ That's why they call me ♪ Bad company Zee, zah, da, da... ♪<br />
♪ And I can't deny... ♪</p>
<p>I love how free and uninhibited you are.</p>
<p>(slurring words): Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>How about I free that big fat snake in your pants and uninhibit myself all over it?</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee belches)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let's hump.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>shit. No. No.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. He... You startled me.</p>
<p>That's a pretty good stance you got there.</p>
<p>Are you trained?</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee scoffs)</p>
<p>I spent some training, yeah.</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>Yeah. Krav Maga.</p>
<p>(scoffs) That's cool.</p>
<p>Judo, karate.</p>
<p>I got more of a Catholic thing going on.</p>
<p>You know, sort of the hand of God.</p>
<p>Stupid idiot. Get out here!</p>
<p>Beat it. We were in the middle of a thing.</p>
<p>No, no. That was really cool.</p>
<p>Could you show me that last move again?</p>
<p>(imitates wind whistling)</p>
<p>Get out of here! Go on!</p>
<p>Get of here!</p>
<p>We're in the middle of some... the middle of something.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Sorry you got a cramp.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Oh, she's really digging her hooks into him, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>What a bitch.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Ugh! Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Oh, the same person keeps calling me.</p>
<p>I'm just gonna answer it.</p>
<p>Hello. Who is this?</p>
<p>Who? Who is...?</p>
<p>I don't know that name.</p>
<p>Who? Who?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, Waitress.</p>
<p>Why didn't you just say that?</p>
<p>Uh, because my name is not Waitress.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>It doesn't even matter.</p>
<p>Did Charlie steal my bike?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Charlie's been with me the entire day.</p>
<p>How did you get this number?</p>
<p>I changed it.</p>
<p>Look, I need my bike back, because if I don't get it back, I'm gonna lose my job.</p>
<p>Look, I don't... (mocking): Ha, ha, ha, ha, ugh!</p>
<p>Hello? Hello?</p>
<p>God! I'm gonna have to change my number again... Holy shit.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Frank, I just realized something.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Without Charlie doing all those insane things he's always doing for the waitress, her life is gonna completely change.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Well, so, she's gonna be constantly calling or dropping by, looking for answers, so there's a very good chance that she's gonna have a front-row seat for the final moment of humiliation.</p>
<p>And that's gonna destroy Charlie for good.</p>
<p>What's the final moment of humiliation?</p>
<p>That's the climactic moment where the rich people reveal their twisted game to all their wealthy friends, and everybody has a good laugh.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank, here's what's gonna have to happen.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to do all of those creepy things on Charlie's list to keep the waitress from poking around while this whole thing runs its course.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>I got something very important planned.</p>
<p>Come in! There's a problem!</p>
<p>I can't make head or tail of Charlie's chicken scratch!</p>
<p>Just do the best you can, okay?</p>
<p>I can't... can't really talk right now.</p>
<p>Putting rat poison in her shampoo.</p>
<p>Just gonna make her hair fall out.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Look, the kid knows her better than anybody else.</p>
<p>If he puts rat poison in her hair, put rat poison in her hair.</p>
<p>Look, I'm busy. I can't talk.</p>
<p>What do you mean, you're busy?!</p>
<p>This is the whole thing, Dennis!</p>
<p>I'm just... I'm getting some stuff done, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>I think she just came in.</p>
<p>(two beeps)</p>
<p>I'm getting another call.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on. Hello?</p>
<p>Who? Who?!</p>
<p>Just say Waitress!</p>
<p>Look, has Charlie been poisoning me?</p>
<p>'Cause I've been... (beep)</p>
<p>Frank, you got to step it up with that list, man.</p>
<p>This bitch is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Just, I'm busy, okay?</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>(beep)</p>
<p>Hello?! Hello?! (grunts)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>No. It's your neighbor.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>(Frank yells)</p>
<p>(Waitress screams)</p>
<p>Can I be, like, perfectly honest with you about something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's a... there's a girl who lives in this building, and, um, well, she's... she's the love of my life.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And, uh... and I like you so much that before we move any further, I just... I don't know.</p>
<p>I had to get that out there, 'cause I think I'm ready to let her go, but I just have to be sure.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Charlie? There you are.</p>
<p>Look, I don't know what kind of twisted game you're playing, but you need to make it stop.</p>
<p>Whoa. Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Really? Because someone's been poisoning me, and something is making my hair just fall out.</p>
<p>Look, calm down, all right?</p>
<p>I-I... I've been with her the last couple days.</p>
<p>I really haven't been anywhere near you.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's been with me.</p>
<p>Oh, shut up, bitch!</p>
<p>Who the hell is this, Charlie?!</p>
<p>Hey! No. She...</p>
<p>She's my girlfriend.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about that. Wow.</p>
<p>(grunting, groaning)</p>
<p>How's this, Trevor?</p>
<p>Is this cool?</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>Get off me!</p>
<p>Shut up, Dee!</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>I got that stupid bitch.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee yells)</p>
<p>Oh! Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Oh!</p>
<p>Clocked him.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh... Oh, no... Amazing!</p>
<p>You guys are out of control.</p>
<p>I'm out of control.</p>
<p>I'm out of control.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are.</p>
<p>Hey, I want to invite you two to a party at our estate tomorrow night.</p>
<p>My father's going public with TaftCo.</p>
<p>Oh, well, then... are you sure you want him to come?</p>
<p>(chuckles): Of course.</p>
<p>He's practically family.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Come on, show me some more of those moves.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Okay, well, this next stuff I learned from a wrestler called The Maniac.</p>
<p>So we're gonna have to go ahead and get pretty oiled up.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>(classical music playing)</p>
<p>This is classy as shit, huh?</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>Dee, crack that open for me, 'cause it's hurting my hands.</p>
<p>Yeah. I wonder why he didn't tell us it was black-tie.</p>
<p>I feel like we're underdressed.</p>
<p>Because, Dee, Trevor loves us for us.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, hey!</p>
<p>Glad you guys could make it.</p>
<p>Thanks, man! How you doing?</p>
<p>These are a few of my old frat brothers.</p>
<p>This is Dee and Mac that I was telling you about.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What's up, boys?</p>
<p>How are you? (laughs)</p>
<p>Hey, um, I'm sorry that we're not dressed appropriately.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys all look so good.</p>
<p>Oh, well, the attire at these sorts of events are... well, things my friends and I take for granted.</p>
<p>Don't be embarrassed, though.</p>
<p>You guys didn't know any better.</p>
<p>No, <em>I</em> should've known better, 'cause I'm practically a Taft myself.</p>
<p>My uncle's probably built into the foundation of this place.</p>
<p>Really? Weird.</p>
<p>Hey, where do you want us to sit?</p>
<p>Well, you guys'll be out here with some of my frat brothers' guests.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse us, we all have some catching up to do.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. We'll... we'll meet you af... we'll see you after.</p>
<p>Kind of weird, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but at least we can make fun of these dorks all night long, right?</p>
<p>That'll be fun. Geeks!</p>
<p>(gasps): Oh, no, Mac.</p>
<p>I see what's going on here.</p>
<p>He's doing to us what I like to do to Charlie and the waitress.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh, no. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>I got that stupid bitch.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee yells)</p>
<p>Oh! Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>Man, biggest losers ever.</p>
<p>You know it.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>That's two for one, fellas.</p>
<p>Come on, pay up, pay up.</p>
<p>Those two are by far the worst we've ever had. Let's go.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>I can't believe it.</p>
<p>That's a tough pill to swallow.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>You know, they're not the only ones who know how to play these games.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'm saying I also know...</p>
<p>I have a thing.</p>
<p>Just come with me. Come with me.</p>
<p>All right, folks, if you could settle down, please?</p>
<p>If I could have your attention.</p>
<p>Uh, thank you all for being here tonight.</p>
<p>I, uh, I wanted you all here so that I could tell you this.</p>
<p>I've decided to go public with TaftCo Enterprises. (chuckles)</p>
<p>Wonderful! Oh, bravo!</p>
<p>Excuse me. Fantastic, Neil!</p>
<p>Good for you! Good for you!</p>
<p>Too bad when you do, the SEC's gonna be all up in your ass.</p>
<p>(crowd murmuring)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You see, you thought you all could get together and play your little games, have some fun, you know, invite some geeks to the ball, swap some stories, have a laugh.</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p>But you took it a little too far... when you gave an inside-trading tip to my friend Mac, didn't you, Trevor?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Pedro.</p>
<p>And by the way, my father's going public with TaftCo next week, so buy stock today at 34, not 36.</p>
<p>(crowd gasps)</p>
<p>Cool. Yeah, I'll call my broker.</p>
<p>Right, call your broker.</p>
<p>Ooh... you ready for round two, big guy?</p>
<p>This-this is taken out of context.</p>
<p>What was the context?</p>
<p>Wrestling.</p>
<p>It's wrestling.</p>
<p>We're oiled up and wrestling.</p>
<p>What is so hard to understand about this?!</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(crowd gasps)</p>
<p>(grunting, laughing)</p>
<p>(crowd gasping)</p>
<p>Nice, huh?</p>
<p>Trevor... you imbecile!</p>
<p>Why would you tell him that?</p>
<p>I didn't know I was being filmed.</p>
<p>If you're in my room, you're always being filmed.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>It's his thing, it's kind of creepy, but...</p>
<p>But that's not all, everyone.</p>
<p>You see, Ruby Taft, she likes to play her little games, too, don't you Ruby?</p>
<p>But I am not gonna let you humiliate my other friend either.</p>
<p>Cause he might be choosing someone else after all.</p>
<p>Charlie, phone call for you.</p>
<p>Charlie, somebody accidentally hit the waitress with my car-- <em>their</em> car, when they were following her.</p>
<p>No... she wants to talk to you.</p>
<p>She says she really needs you.</p>
<p>Wait, did <em>she</em> say that, or are <em>you</em> just saying it?</p>
<p>Yeah, talk to her yourself.</p>
<p>Charlie, look, I don't know what's been going on, but if you think you can make it stop, I need your help.</p>
<p>I want you back in my life.</p>
<p>Do you really mean that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I need you.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll be right there.</p>
<p>Awesome. Well, I'm out of here.</p>
<p>What? What are you talking about.</p>
<p>I'm leaving.</p>
<p>I'm going to be with the waitress-- she's the woman I love.</p>
<p>No, but I... I wasn't using you like Charlie was.</p>
<p>He's a total asshole.</p>
<p>I really, really, really like you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Okay? I was using <em>you.</p>
<p>That's why I kissed you in front of the waitress.</p>
<p>That's why I banged you a bunch of times, just to make the waitress jealous.</p>
<p>Amazing. You slept with me almost instantly.</p>
<p>And by the way, a quality woman doesn't do that.</p>
<p>She doesn't say yes right away.</p>
<p>She says no to a man, for years, like, ten years.</p>
<p>That's what a real woman does, okay?</p>
<p>You know what you were acting like?</p>
<p>A stupid little rich slut.</p>
<p>And that's all that you are.</p>
<p>(sobbing): How can you do this to me?</p>
<p>Are you still talking?</p>
<p>Go away, dumb-dumb.</p>
<p>Go run and hide. Go from me.</p>
<p>I don't want to see you anymore.</p>
<p>(laughs): Women, right?</p>
<p>Ah, man, all right, cool.</p>
<p>I'm out! All right!</p>
<p>I didn't see that coming.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Guess Charlie had the cruelest intentions of all, huh?</p>
<p>Uh, see? Feeling better?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I-I've, um, I've been thinking about the restraining order.</p>
<p>You're gonna get rid of it?</p>
<p>(laughs): No. No, no.</p>
<p>But, um, but I was thinking about reducing it from, like, a hundred feet to, like... 50 feet?</p>
<p>Awesome! Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I can work with that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh, so now? Starting now?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>Could you just leave the soup there?</p>
<p>Uh... is this okay over here, or...?</p>
<p>(laughs): Uh, I don't think there's 50 feet in this room, so...</p>
<p>I'll go down the hall. Okay.</p>
<p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>All right, well, that's fine.</p>
<p>From a distance, though.</em></p>
