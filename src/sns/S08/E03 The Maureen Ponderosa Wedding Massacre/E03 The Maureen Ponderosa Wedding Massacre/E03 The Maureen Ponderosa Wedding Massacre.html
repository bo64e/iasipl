<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Where are you guys?!</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>(Frank groans)</p>
<p>What's happening?!</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p>Over here!</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(all shouting)</p>
<p>Over here.</p>
<p>We're all here?!</p>
<p>We're all here?!</p>
<p>Guys!</p>
<p>(siren whoops)</p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>Stop where you are!</p>
<p>You four got some explaining to do.</p>
<p>(thunder rumbling)</p>
<p>I got 15 different wedding guests out there with various degrees of injury.</p>
<p>I got a groom-- face is half gone!</p>
<p>And I'm still missing a bride.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened back there, but we are innocent.</p>
<p>We're completely innocent.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you four bozos are the only people on the scene that weren't invited.</p>
<p>So you can see how bad this looks.</p>
<p>Now, who is Mr. Dennis Reynolds?</p>
<p>Oh, that's me.</p>
<p>Hmm, hello, Dennis.</p>
<p>Those are some interesting marks on your neck.</p>
<p>Let me guess.</p>
<p>Ex-wife's getting remarried, you get a little jealous.</p>
<p>Get your buddies together, you decide to break up that party.</p>
<p>So you crash the wedding, get a little tipsy, things take a violent turn.</p>
<p>No, no, no, look.</p>
<p>That is the exact opposite of what I wanted to happen.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure that that wedding happened!</p>
<p>Why is Maureen getting married in the middle of the woods?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Some people find the woods romantic, I guess.</p>
<p>And why get married on Friday the 13th?</p>
<p>It's a monster day.</p>
<p>I don't know and I don't care.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure the wedding happens.</p>
<p>I'm tired of paying alimony.</p>
<p>Well, we got your back, bro.</p>
<p>Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>I don't need you to have my back.</p>
<p>Three people crashing a wedding-- it's gonna make a scene.</p>
<p>Why couldn't you just let me do this alone?</p>
<p>Just don't like getting bussed up there.</p>
<p>I feel like we're gonna be trapped.</p>
<p>I don't, I don't like any of this.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I don't like this place already.</p>
<p>This is a strange place, right?</p>
<p>I'm seeing a lot of bats.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's bats everywhere.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>'Cause it's Friday the 13th.</p>
<p>No, no, no, stop.</p>
<p>Will you stop with that?</p>
<p>It's not because it's Friday the 13th.</p>
<p>We're in the woods.</p>
<p>Stop being paranoid.</p>
<p>Still, this is creepy.</p>
<p>I mean, who gets married in a spot like this?</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>You guys crashing my wedding?</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>You?!</p>
<p>Wait, Liam, <em>you're</em> marrying Maureen?</p>
<p>Big-time.</p>
<p>Don't be jelly.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>What's your angle?</p>
<p>Oldest angle in the book, my friend.</p>
<p>(grunts): Love.</p>
<p>I don't buy this, okay?</p>
<p>I thought you were in love with Ryan.</p>
<p>What's your brother think about all this?</p>
<p>Ryan's dead to me.</p>
<p>Do you hear me?</p>
<p>He's dead!</p>
<p>So, I take it he doesn't approve?</p>
<p>That's a negative, Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>Now, I'd ask you guys to leave, but I'm just too damn happy.</p>
<p>(groans weakly)</p>
<p>See you bitches on the dance floor.</p>
<p>I don't like this, okay?</p>
<p>This is a McPoyle-Ponderosa wedding.</p>
<p>This is, this is bad.</p>
<p>Look, look, if you're gonna be here, I need your support.</p>
<p>You need to help me make sure this wedding goes off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Hold on. What made you think this wasn't gonna happen?</p>
<p>Mac had heard there were some people there who wanted to ruin the wedding.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Him.</p>
<p>(groans): Ah!</p>
<p>That is bullshit!</p>
<p>I was there to support my buddy.</p>
<p>That was a swervy road.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I knew it.</p>
<p>You're here to break up this wedding.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I'm here to support my friend, Bill Ponderosa.</p>
<p>I'm his AA sponsor!</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>You two love the fact that I have to pay alimony the rest of my life.</p>
<p>You love the power you have over me with this financial burden.</p>
<p>You know what, Dennis, not everything is about you, okay?</p>
<p>I am here to support Frank.</p>
<p>No, you two are here to make a scene.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>If anybody's making a scene, it's you!</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Ow! Ow!</p>
<p>I just got tagged by a bat!</p>
<p>He got you.</p>
<p>I got tagged!</p>
<p>Suck out the poison, Dee!</p>
<p>I'm not sucking on your head.</p>
<p>Suck it out!</p>
<p>I'll give you $200, you suck it out.</p>
<p>$200? I'll do it!</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>I'll do it for $200.</p>
<p>Suck it quick.</p>
<p>What are you...?</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that I was talking about!</p>
<p>Suck it harder!</p>
<p>Go home, please!</p>
<p>Suck it harder!</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Did you swallow it?!</p>
<p>Of course I swallowed.</p>
<p>Make yourself throw up!</p>
<p>Yeah, you swallowed the poison!</p>
<p>Get it out! Get it out!</p>
<p>Vomit! Vomit!</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>There is no poison from a bat!</p>
<p>No! You are gonna ruin this!</p>
<p>You're all gonna ruin this!</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee retching)</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>It won't come, Frank.</p>
<p>Deandra.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Let's go break up this wedding.</p>
<p>Whoa, stop, stop!</p>
<p>So you <em>were</em> there to break up the wedding.</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Did I just say that part?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why did you want to break up the wedding?</p>
<p>For all the things he just said.</p>
<p>That was accurate.</p>
<p>But it wasn't just our idea to break up the wedding.</p>
<p>Not at first.</p>
<p>Last week, we had a visitor at the bar.</p>
<p>(door creaks)</p>
<p>(thunder cracks)</p>
<p>They have to be stopped.</p>
<p>The McPoyle bloodline's been pure and clean for a thousand years.</p>
<p>This marriage is an abomination.</p>
<p>Now, when you say "pure and clean ," uh, you mean what, exactly?</p>
<p>Means we haven't bred outside the bloodline.</p>
<p>For a thousand years?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Dennis knows Maureen better than anyone.</p>
<p>Only he can talk her out of this.</p>
<p>The last thing Dennis wants to do is break up this wedding.</p>
<p>But we do.</p>
<p>(thunder cracks)</p>
<p>Okay, I brought a disguise.</p>
<p>Meh!</p>
<p>They're gonna know who you are.</p>
<p>This will work.</p>
<p>Now sneak me in so we can go kill Maureen.</p>
<p>Kill?</p>
<p>Who said anything about killing anybody?</p>
<p>No one's killing anyone.</p>
<p>We'll sneak you in to Liam so you guys can talk or bang or whatever it is you want to do.</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Oh, thank God you're here, man.</p>
<p>I am not gonna make it.</p>
<p>I am itching to get blitzed.</p>
<p>Weddings are a big trigger for me, man.</p>
<p>Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p>You're my sponsor, Frank.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>My support system.</p>
<p>Oh, right, right, right.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>So, do whatever you feel is best.</p>
<p>Well, I feel it would be best if I pounded a beer.</p>
<p>I'll support that decision.</p>
<p>I wish I could.</p>
<p>I mean, it's a dry wedding, for God's sakes.</p>
<p>They're serving milk.</p>
<p>I feel like maybe I should do some drug then, you know?</p>
<p>That bad?</p>
<p>You earned it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You do whatever you feel like.</p>
<p>You're a good person.</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Cool, cool.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Diddly Dee.</p>
<p>Miss me?</p>
<p>Don't answer that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Catch you guys later.</p>
<p>You're a bad sponsor.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I supported every decision he wanted to make.</p>
<p>Stop wasting time!</p>
<p>Ow! God!</p>
<p>Let's go find Liam.</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>Don't hit me.</p>
<p>(somber classical music playing)</p>
<p>Things have already taken a bit of a dark turn, it would seem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, I need to get to Maureen before Frank and Dee.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Oh, we'll come with you.</p>
<p>No, just hang back.</p>
<p>I got this, okay?</p>
<p>Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We could definitely get laid here.</p>
<p>Huh? What?</p>
<p>Maureen, I need to speak with you.</p>
<p>Dennis!</p>
<p>OMG, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Well, uh, I have reason to believe that someone is here to destroy this special day for you, so I'm sure to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>That is so sweet, Dennis.</p>
<p>I also brought along some legal documents, so if we could just wrap this up lickety-split.</p>
<p>Legal documents? What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I realize my timing is a little unorthodox, but, uh, I figure what better way to make sure your union is totally complete than by having you sign these documents that I need you to sign?</p>
<p>So if I can just get your signature right here, and I'll run up and get Liam's signature, and this'll be on the books and your wedding... Muh!</p>
<p>My Maureen, you've... you've enhanced yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got my tooth fixed.</p>
<p>I'm talking about your tits!</p>
<p>You big, giant new titties, Maureen!</p>
<p>Why would you do that now?</p>
<p>Why not when we were together when I could've...?</p>
<p>I told you I was willing to change.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I didn't know you meant physically, that you would change physically.</p>
<p>Why weren't you more clear with me, Maureen?</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna get distracted.</p>
<p>Just, just sign right here... Wait!</p>
<p>What are you doing in here?!</p>
<p>You can't see the bride before the ceremony!</p>
<p>No, no!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>I just need her to sign this!</p>
<p>No! Get out of here!</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait! Maureen!</p>
<p>No matter what happens, you got to go through with this!</p>
<p>Out!</p>
<p>Liam is your destiny, Maureen!</p>
<p>Oh, here he comes.</p>
<p>I didn't get it.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm so close, I'm so close.</p>
<p>Do you know where Liam is?</p>
<p>Maybe I can get his signature first.</p>
<p>I didn't see him anywhere.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I got to bring this up.</p>
<p>Things are getting really weird.</p>
<p>I mean, check out Pappy McPoyle.</p>
<p>(yelling incoherently)</p>
<p>What is that all about?</p>
<p>I'll tell you what that's all about.</p>
<p>Zombies.</p>
<p>Zombies?</p>
<p>I seen it once before in a rat, and I seen it now in men.</p>
<p>Once one gets a taste for its own kind, it can spread through the pack like a wildfire.</p>
<p>Mindlessly chomping and biting at their own hinds.</p>
<p>Nothing but the taste of flesh on their minds.</p>
<p>You know the thing about a rat?</p>
<p>It's got life in its eyes.</p>
<p>Black eyes like a doll's eye.</p>
<p>Don't seem to be living at all when it come at ya.</p>
<p>Till it bites ya.</p>
<p>And then the eyes roll over white.</p>
<p>You don't hear nothing but the screaming and the hollering.</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>Are you doing the speech from <em>Jaws?</p>
<p>Nah...</p>
<p>Are you doing Jaws?</p>
<p>We don't have time for this shit.</p>
<p>This is serious.</p>
<p>Look, it wasn't zombies, okay?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then you explain what happened next.</p>
<p>Okay, it's time to get out of here.</p>
<p>I mean, look at that guy.</p>
<p>The McPoyles sprung from my loins, fully formed!</p>
<p>One of them babies tried to eat me!</p>
<p>I ate him first!</p>
<p>(sobs): I ate him first!</p>
<p>Okay, I'm with Charlie. I'm leaving.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>You guys are just gonna leave?</p>
<p>You're gonna, you're gonna go?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're out.</p>
<p>You know what? I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, go, go, go. Yeah, get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>I didn't want you here in the first place!</p>

<p>Yeah, I understand the McPoyle bloodline's very strong.</p>
<p>Legions of us thousand sturdy ones ruled this fine land.</p>
<p>Our bloodline was as pure as the driven snow.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. And then what happened?</p>
<p>Syphilis killed about half of us.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Mongoloidism got most of the rest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, there's somebody inside who wants to talk to you about this.</p>
<p>Mm?</p>
<p>Who's this guy?</p>
<p>Ryan!</p>
<p>We need to talk!</p>
<p>We'll leave you guys alone.</p>
<p>Let them hash it out themselves.</p>
<p>It'll bust up.</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>(guttural groaning)</p>
<p>(screeches)</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>(guttural groaning)</p>
<p>I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>No, no, no, Deandra!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, you gotta stay! - I don't have to stay.</p>
<p>You gotta finish this.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm not going to.</p>
<p>But we're not done!</p>
<p>Don't, don't go out there!</p>
<p>Deandra!</p>
<p>And we never saw Dee again.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We saw Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's when the shit started hitting the fan.</p>
<p>Oh, look, there's Dee! Dee!</p>
<p>Dee! Don't go down there!</p>
<p>Do not go down there!</p>
<p>We just got attacked by a bunch of zombies!</p>
<p>Yeah, and the shuttle bus is gone!</p>
<p>A zombie must have stolen your car!</p>
<p>Your car is gone!</p>
<p>There's no way out of here!</p>
<p>There's no way out!</p>
<p>(Dee growls)</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>(screaming continues)</p>
<p>She's infected! She's infected!</p>
<p>Liam? Liam?!</p>
<p>Liam! Hello, Liam?</p>
<p>Frank?</p>
<p>Hi, Dennis. (cackles)</p>
<p>What did you do with Liam?</p>
<p>You're too late.</p>
<p>He's getting talked out of it!</p>
<p>Ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p>Get out of my way.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Get out of my way, Frank!</p>
<p>(gagging)</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing?</p>
<p>I'm begging Liam for forgiveness!</p>
<p>It's time we move on.</p>
<p>Liam convinced me it's not our blood that's being tainted.</p>
<p>It's us tainting the blood of others.</p>
<p>McPoyles will take over the world!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! It backfired!</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>And first step towards that is signing this.</p>
<p>So Liam, if you'd just sign right there, please.</p>
<p>Just sign right there.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Stupid asses.</p>
<p>(Dennis laughs)</p>
<p>One down, one to go. (laughs)</p>
<p>Nice try, Frank.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>Get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>Get out of the way!</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>We gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>I'm not going anywhere, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm not going anywhere till I get that signature.</p>
<p>(Dee screaming)</p>
<p>Go, go, go!</p>
<p>(both gasping)</p>
<p>Hey, dude, check it out.</p>
<p>Remember when Dee, you know, she sucked that bat poison or whatever out of Frank's head from the vampire bat?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That must be what turned her into a zombie.</p>
<p>Why would a vampire bat turn you into a zombie?</p>
<p>You're mixing up your horror genres.</p>
<p>If anything, it would turn you into a vampire.</p>
<p>Right or a bat, or a bat.</p>
<p>Or Batman.</p>
<p>No, a vampire turns you into a vampire.</p>
<p>A zombie turns you into a zombie and Batman didn't get turned into anything.</p>
<p>He just likes bats.</p>
<p>That can't possibly be what Batman's about.</p>
<p>It's about a grown man who dresses up like a bat?</p>
<p>And goes around solving crimes and mysteries, yes.</p>
<p>These are Academy Award winning movies.</p>
<p>This is serious stuff.</p>
<p>Well, you know the Academy, Charlie, I mean...</p>
<p>I know the Academy as well as anybody.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's atrocious.</p>
<p>Well, to bring it all back around, I think when Dee drank the bat blood, that's how she got sick.</p>
<p>Frank's blood.</p>
<p>Yes, but the bat juices.</p>
<p>You know, the bat saliva, bat rabies.</p>
<p>No, no, it's not...</p>
<p>Bat rabies, I buy.</p>
<p>Bat rabies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like the...</p>
<p>Dude, we got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah, go.</em></p>
<p>Things had gotten completely insane.</p>
<p>Dennis was trying to get the signature from Maureen, but we were just trying to get the hell out of there.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Frank, what the hell's going on?</p>
<p>Dude, we got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Where's Dennis?</p>
<p>I lost him.</p>
<p>You guys, I couldn't get it.</p>
<p>I couldn't get it.</p>
<p>She wouldn't sign it.</p>
<p>I couldn't get the stupid bitch to sign.</p>
<p>She didn't sign?</p>
<p>This has all gone bad.</p>
<p>It's gone terribly, terribly bad.</p>
<p>What did you do?</p>
<p>I did something bad.</p>
<p>I did something really, really bad; guys, we got to get out of here before everybody finds out what happened.</p>
<p>Guys, I messed up.</p>
<p>I messed up bad.</p>
<p>(glass breaking)</p>
<p>All right, guys, let's just make a break for it.</p>
<p>Which way?</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: One, two, three, go.</p>
<p>Come on, come on, this way, this way, this way.</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>My face! My face!</p>
<p>My face!</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>(screaming continues)</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>Over here, over here.</p>
<p>(indistinct yelling)</p>
<p>And then that's where you picked us up, and honestly, that's all that we know.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you're telling me that this was a wedding full of zombies?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, bat rabies zombies.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>There was weird incestuous jealousies, we don't know what was going on.</p>
<p>Bottom line, you got the wrong guys.</p>
<p>We're innocent.</p>
<p>Yes, we're totally innocent.</p>
<p>Marconi, we just picked somebody up from the site who's claiming to know what happened.</p>
<p>She was locked in a freezer.</p>
<p>Don't let her in here.</p>
<p>No, she's been infected.</p>
<p>I'm not infected, you stupid idiots.</p>
<p>No one was infected.</p>
<p>Here's what happened.</p>
<p>Let them hash it out themselves.</p>
<p>It'll bust up.</p>
<p>Yeah. (gasps)</p>
<p>(hissing)</p>
<p>I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>Deandra.</p>
<p>(barking)</p>
<p>Dee's nuts.</p>
<p>What's the haps?</p>
<p>Here, have a sip, right from the cow's titty.</p>
<p>You'll love it.</p>
<p>No, Bill, no.</p>
<p>I got to get out of here, okay?</p>
<p>shit is going crazy.</p>
<p>No, don't go.</p>
<p>Party's just starting.</p>
<p>You got to have some.</p>
<p>Come on, try it.</p>
<p>Come on, it'll loosen you up a bit, make your butthole hot.</p>
<p>How is drinking a glass of milk going to loosen me up, Bill?</p>
<p>Well, I spiked the milk with methylenedioxypyrovalerone.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's bath salts.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it's like coke and acid and meth all combined.</p>
<p>It's awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>So everyone here is on bath salts?</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, just move.</p>
<p>(bellows)</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Bath salts?</p>
<p>The drug that makes people eat each other's faces?</p>
<p>Wait, that would explain the zombie behavior.</p>
<p>Right, okay, Dee, so you were on bath salts and that's why you went all nuts on us.</p>
<p>Now it makes sense.</p>
<p>That is not why I went nuts on you guys.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I went nuts on you because of what you assholes did to my goddamn car!</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Dude, when was the last time you drove a car?</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, man.</p>
<p>I can drive; I remember how.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, wait.</p>
<p>(screaming): No!</p>
<p>(horn honking)</p>
<p>(gasping)</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p>What happened, dude?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>I forgot how to drive.</p>
<p>I forgot how to drive.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Oh, look, Charlie, there's Dee.</p>
<p>Dee, don't go down that way.</p>
<p>We just got attacked by a bunch of zombie people.</p>
<p>The shuttle's gone.</p>
<p>Zombies must have stolen your car.</p>
<p>There's no way out of here.</p>
<p>Dude... (screaming)</p>
<p>You sons of bitches!</p>
<p>You're gonna pay!</p>
<p>You're all gonna pay!</p>
<p>I'll kill you!</p>
<p>You assholes, you'll pay!</p>
<p>No, we won't pay.</p>
<p>We never do.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Okay, well, there it is.</p>
<p>You know, there's the whole story.</p>
<p>Ponderosa spiked the punch.</p>
<p>Somebody hopped up on bath salts but Liam's face, and, uh, case closed, you know?</p>
<p>Hey, good for you.</p>
<p>Good for us.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Ba-da-bing.</p>
<p>Hey, whoa.</p>
<p>Sit down, slick.</p>
<p>Now that may explain some of the shit that went on here, but it doesn't answer the question of the missing bride.</p>
<p>Since you're the one with motive and the last one to be seen with her, you're my new #1 suspect.</p>
<p>No, no. (scoffs)</p>
<p>That's... I didn't murder her.</p>
<p>Then tell me what happened to her!</p>
<p>I-I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Listen, if you confess, I can help you, but you got to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, all right, all right. Okay.</p>
<p>Look, if I tell you what I did, will you just help me, please?</p>
<p>Because I need help.</p>
<p>I'll see what I can do with the DA, but I need you to confess.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>I-I was just going to see her to get the final signature so I could put this whole thing behind me.</p>
<p>When I saw her...</p>
<p>Something bad happened.</p>
<p>Something very bad.</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, God, Maureen.</p>
<p>That was terrible.</p>
<p>Who did those tits?</p>
<p>The nipple placement is crazy.</p>
<p>I love you, Dennis Reynolds.</p>
<p>No, you don't.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>No, look, you're just gonna sign these papers and we're gonna be done with this, okay?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Let's run away together.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm gonna run away, but not with you.</p>
<p>I'm gonna find you.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, you're not gonna find me, no, no.</p>
<p>We can't do this, Maureen.</p>
<p>Oh, no, please.</p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p>Oh, God, what have I done?</p>
<p>(sobbing): Oh, God.</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>So all that shit about us ruining the wedding...</p>
<p>And the zombies and the bath salts and the blood...</p>
<p>It turns out you blew it yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, congratulations, Frank.</p>
<p>You win.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be paying alimony to that crazy bitch for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>You expect me to believe this woman's gonna throw her entire life away just to sleep with her ex-husband on her wedding night?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds, you're free to go.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Why am I free...?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Someone posted your bail.</p>
<p>Come on, silly head.</p>
<p>Let's go home and put this whole adventure behind us.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, you got to help me.</p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p>You got to help me!</p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
