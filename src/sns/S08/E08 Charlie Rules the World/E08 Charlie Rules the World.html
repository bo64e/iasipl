<p>You were disrespectful to me.</p>
<p>That's the past.</p>
<p>God, get a life.</p>
<p>This is my life, bitch.</p>
<p>You bitch!</p>
<p>Aw, you slut.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Ah, hold still, Charlie-- you're flickering.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Sorry, it's... I'm trying to get you good images, but I keep getting shocked a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Well, don't let that affect your work.</p>
<p>No, I'm really trying not to.</p>
<p>It's just that, you know, I have to run the wires from the other building...</p>
<p>Building and, you know, there's asbestos in the ducts, which...</p>
<p>Good for breathing, so I'm tired.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Why are you watching this crap?</p>
<p>Come on, turn the TV off.</p>
<p>Let's go out, let's do something-- I'm bored.</p>
<p>Hey, let's go dancing, huh?</p>
<p>I want to do something.</p>
<p>Dancing?</p>
<p>We're watching <em>Real Housewives.</p>
<p>You know, there's nothing real about this shit, Frank.</p>
<p>You know that, come on.</p>
<p>Real women don't even look like that.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p>That is what real women look like.</p>
<p>Dee, are you sick?</p>
<p>No, I feel great.</p>
<p>Oh, I haven't had a chance to shower for a few days.</p>
<p>I've been gaming like a loon.</p>
<p>You've been what?</p>
<p>Gaming-- I've been playing this online video game.</p>
<p>It is awesome.</p>
<p>Charlie, speaking of which, you want to come play my avatar for a little bit while I run some errands?</p>
<p>I don't want my crops to die.</p>
<p>Nah, I'm kind of busy working for the guys at the ele...</p>
<p>(groans) shit!</p>
<p>Yes, he's working for us.</p>
<p>He will do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>We're going dancing. Come on!</p>
<p>What if I give you three bucks?</p>
<p>Hey, you're our employee.</p>
<p>You do what we say.</p>
<p>I pay your rent.</p>
<p>Do not drop those wires!</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, to live is to dance.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Charlie, what if I gave you five bucks?</p>
<p>You owe me five bucks!</p>
<p>(electrical snap)</p>
<p>(Charlie yells)</p>
<p>Ah, shit! Screw it!</p>
<p>Son of a bitch! shit!</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go with Dee, okay?</p>
<p>But I'm getting sick of this shit, I really am.</p>
<p>You treat me like a dumb-dumb and a grunt, and I have potential, you know?</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>I can go places, I can do things.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I might even rule the world one day.</p>
<p>Rule the world, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, if that happens, I'll blow myself.</p>
<p>(sighs)</em></p>
<p>Okay, so it's called <em>TechPocalypse,</em> right?</p>
<p>And we're post-apocalypse, and we have to rebuild civilization.</p>
<p>This is me, ZingingCutie23.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!</p>
<p>ZingingCutie 23.</p>
<p>Are you pretending that you're 23 years old?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It seems like it.</p>
<p>No, I... It's... I... It's a random number that I picked.</p>
<p>It's a random number?</p>
<p>It's a number to put at the end of that.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Just watch over my tribe, and make sure nobody, you know, takes it over, and I'll give you your money, okay?</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Wait.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. What is that?</p>
<p>That's you.</p>
<p>You're one of my subjects.</p>
<p>That's me.</p>
<p>Why am I in the game?</p>
<p>Is that Mac?</p>
<p>Of course that's Mac.</p>
<p>You guys are all here.</p>
<p>See, Mac's my handmaiden.</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>And Dennis is a midget blacksmith.</p>
<p>(Dennis character babbles)</p>
<p>Frank is a mutant half-donkey.</p>
<p>(braying)</p>
<p>And you're my jester.</p>
<p>Why am I eating out of a trough?</p>
<p>Made sense.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>So let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You've been playing this game for, like, a week straight just so you feel like you lord over all of us?</p>
<p>Is that what this is?</p>
<p>Charlie, do you want your five bucks or not?</p>
<p>I want my five dollars.</p>
<p>It's just pathetic, Dee.</p>
<p>Okay, well, maybe it is.</p>
<p>Maybe it isn't.</p>
<p>I really do need the money, though.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, then get to work.</p>
<p>Can you give me an advance?</p>
<p>No, not in advance.</p>
<p>We'll see how well you do.</p>
<p>All right, I got this.</p>
<p>I got this.</p>
<p>(dance music plays)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, this is what I'm talking about, guys, huh?</p>
<p>I mean, playing online video games and watching stupid reality shows-- that's not real life.</p>
<p>It's keeping people from experiencing real life.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>This is real.</p>
<p>It's real, but it feels weird as shit.</p>
<p>There's nobody else in the bar dancing.</p>
<p>We're setting the tone, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, we will lead, and others will follow.</p>
<p>I'm stopping.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, don't stop.</p>
<p>Look, all right, let's go do some shots, and that will get you guys fired up, and we'll come back out, and we'll do some more of this or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, you can do the move, and... well, come on, come on, come on, come on.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, bartender, three shots of whiskey, come on.</p>
<p>Hey, I know you guys.</p>
<p>You're the donkey man and the princess, right?</p>
<p>We don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>Take a hike, Bozo.</p>
<p>Geek.</p>
<p>Check it out. Look at this.</p>
<p>This is... this is you, right?</p>
<p>This-this is Frank and-and Mac from ZingingCutie's tribe?</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>This is Dee's online video game, and she's created characters for all of us.</p>
<p>She's humiliating us virtually.</p>
<p>Who cares? It's a video game.</p>
<p>What do you mean, who cares?</p>
<p>This is starting to piss me off.</p>
<p>Stop getting invested in fake realities.</p>
<p>Let's live real life!</p>
<p>Well, Dennis, my anger feels very real.</p>
<p>Are you feeling it?</p>
<p>Are you feeling it?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it's not real.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>I-I-I... I'm angry.</p>
<p>Okay, it's not real, and you know what it also isn't?</p>
<p>It also isn't epic, okay?</p>
<p>And you know what is epic?</p>
<p>Doing these shots, going out there and dancing.</p>
<p>Come on, do it, do the shots.</p>
<p>I'll do the shots.</p>
<p>I'll just do the shots.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(groaning)</p>
<p>(grunting)</p>
<p>(high-pitched humming)</p>
<p>Oh, somebody got a smart phone.</p>
<p>Okay, you know, I tell you what, Carl.</p>
<p>Let's settle for a C trade.</p>
<p>We'll call it a day on that.</p>
<p>I got to run.</p>
<p>ZingingCutie44 is back, so I'm out.</p>
<p>(laughing): Changed your name.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, Charlie?</p>
<p>I told you to just feed my crops.</p>
<p>I did, I fed your crops, and then I gathered some rocks, and I built a little wall around your tribe.</p>
<p>Then I used the leftover rocks to dam the river so that you could fish.</p>
<p>Now you're doing well in the game.</p>
<p>You sucked at it, all right?</p>
<p>All you did was spend your money on stuff you don't need, just like in real life.</p>
<p>I don't do that in real life.</p>
<p>Yes, you do.</p>
<p>What did you get at the store?</p>
<p>I bought a smart phone so that I can play the game on the go.</p>
<p>What's going on with the fingernails?</p>
<p>Well, I had those done like Flo-Jo.</p>
<p>Why?! It's craziness.</p>
<p>I just thought it would be funny.</p>
<p>I... Dee, this is your problem.</p>
<p>I could take this money, I could feed myself for a month.</p>
<p>I would buy milk, I would buy flour, I'd buy vitamins, I'd boil them down to little energy balls to sustain me, but whatever. Forget it.</p>
<p>Enjoy your game, enjoy all your new followers, and you're welcome.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Charlie, you got me 31 new followers?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's amazing!</p>
<p>Hey, do you want to maybe team up?</p>
<p>No, 'cause I don't want to be a slave.</p>
<p>Come on, Charlie, please.</p>
<p>I need you.</p>
<p>It's, like, when I'm doing good in the game, I'm doing good in life.</p>
<p>Oh, I want to make fun of you for saying that, but I kind of know what you mean.</p>
<p>It's like I'm thriving.</p>
<p>You are thriving.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did feel that, and I...</p>
<p>You felt that?</p>
<p>I did, I felt that, you know, and I never get to thrive.</p>
<p>I want to be the guy who thrives for once.</p>
<p>Right? Me, neither.</p>
<p>All right, I'll tell you what-- make me your king, and let's get rocking.</p>
<p>Ew, no. I don't want to do that 'cause we'd have to be married, and that would be awful.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I'll see you later.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Sit down, sit down, sit down.</p>
<p>I'll make you my king; just accept my request to consummate.</p>
<p>Consummate? What is that?</p>
<p>Have sex.</p>
<p>Oh. So, um, we should have sex then?</p>
<p>In the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the game, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Either way.</p>
<p>Uh, so, push enter hard, or one, like, slow push, and you do your thing, or a little circular action?</p>
<p>Just push the button, Charlie.</p>
<p>Just push the button.</p>
<p>(Charlie grunts)</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>That was good, right?</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>You see me, Frank, you see me coming?</p>
<p>I see you, I see you.</p>
<p>Oh, here comes another guy.</p>
<p>I'm gonna fight him.</p>
<p>Mac attack!</p>
<p>Fight!</p>
<p>I lost again!</p>
<p>Goddamn it, how do I keep losing?</p>
<p>I'm huge.</p>
<p>Stop fighting every guy in the game.</p>
<p>The fighting is the best part.</p>
<p>It's the only reason I'm playing.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, will you guys please shut up?</p>
<p>I'm hungover as shit.</p>
<p>We're playing <em>TechPocalypse.</p>
<p>(Dennis groans)</p>
<p>Mac is a soiled fool, and I am a gorgeous girl with big cans and I'm banging all the fishermen in sight for fish and I'm also being catty with all the women in the game, like I'm a Real Housewife.</p>
<p>Look, Dennis, I-I'm six-foot- ten.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to be six- foot-ten.</p>
<p>Hey, look, Mac, you're five- foot-nine, and Frank, you're a man-- an ugly, old man!</p>
<p>You're not understanding this, Dennis, but I think I have something that could help you wrap your head around it.</p>
<p>("All Night Long" by Lionel Richie playing)</p>
<p>I've never had my hair cut in a bedroom.</p>
<p>Well, one thing I've learned from cutting hair all these years, Danielle, is you don't have to go to a high-end salon to get a high-end salon-quality cut.</p>
<p>Little spritz?</p>
<p>Why are we watching Dennis' sex tape?</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>It's cold.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, we'll make it hot in a minute, don't worry about that.</p>
<p>(Dennis and woman chuckle)</p>
<p>(Frank groans)</p>
<p>Well, don't... Well, it's always-- there's always so much, so much preamble.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, um, all right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, how does this make you feel?</p>
<p>Powerful.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, but how does it affect you sexually?</p>
<p>I'm very aroused right now.</p>
<p>I, too, am aroused.</p>
<p>I'm starting to swell up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, now all three of us are aroused, and there's not a woman in the room.</p>
<p>See, this is no different than sports or video games.</p>
<p>It's all a virtual experience.</p>
<p>No, no, no, bullshit, this was real, okay, this happened, I did this.</p>
<p>All right, I drew this woman in, I styled her hair, I entered her with almost no resistance.</p>
<p>I did these things.</p>
<p>You say it's real, but what even is reality?</p>
<p>Yeah, who knows?</p>
<p>We don't even know if we're in this room.</p>
<p>We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go out into the real world again today and have real experiences.</p>
<p>I'm gonna draw those people in to me, okay?</p>
<p>A turtle's dream.</p>
<p>That's crazy, lunacy.</em></p>
<p>So, tell me something, Queen of Thrones, how about we stop being enemies, we start becoming friends here, huh?</p>
<p>Charlie, I just got a new nose and I'm flying to Miami to get my lips inflated.</p>
<p>Can you hang on one second?</p>
<p>What, Dee, what are you buying?</p>
<p>How are you paying for that?</p>
<p>We have plenty of money.</p>
<p>I know we have money.</p>
<p>We have money because I...</p>
<p>All right, you know what?</p>
<p>Yes, fine, buy your lips, buy your noses, buy whatever you're gonna buy.</p>
<p>All right, don't interrupt me when I'm running our tribe, okay, 'cause that's kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>I know, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>All right, so don't interrupt.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do me a favor, refill my bowl of energy balls, okay?</p>
<p>Please make yourself useful.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, Queen of Thrones, let me step into my office here.</p>
<p>Hey, bitch!</p>
<p>Frank, you are SweetPeaches69?</p>
<p>How did you get so many followers?</p>
<p>What can I say?</p>
<p>Some girls are more popular than others.</p>
<p>Are you wearing a mink coat?</p>
<p>What, this old thing?</p>
<p>Guy gave it to me for going down on him.</p>
<p>I've been getting a lot of gifts lately.</p>
<p>I just got sent a whole box of peaches-- real ones.</p>
<p>I'm eating like a goddamn islander.</p>
<p>I'm living a pretty classy life these days.</p>

<p>Ooh, you should come to my party.</p>
<p>I'm gonna meet a lot of my online friends there.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a very classy affair, but you can come anyway.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Well, look, we can sit here, we can talk cheesesteaks all day long, but maybe you and I could get together at my bar, settle this thing once and for all.</p>
<p>Charlie, we got to talk.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>We're going to a party-- a real one-- Frank's throwing it.</p>
<p>Yes, I know what's going on.</p>
<p>I know everything that's happening.</p>
<p>Do you know he has a bunch of followers?</p>
<p>Do you know that he's parading around in a mink coat, and he humiliated me?</p>
<p>I'm a queen, okay?</p>
<p>I should be the one wearing mink and I should be throwing digs at him.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I should have a lot more followers.</p>
<p>You want mink, Dee, you want a mink coat?</p>
<p>You want a nice, real mink coat, not a virtual one like Frank?</p>
<p>Don't dick around with this.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>I am dead serious.</p>
<p>I trade with a guy online; he has a clothing store.</p>
<p>I'm sure I could give him some crops, maybe a follower or two, and he'll give you a mink coat.</p>
<p>For me?</p>
<p>Would you like that?</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>You, you would like that, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>You know how that's not gonna happen?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It's not gonna happen if I'm not playing the goddamn game!</p>
<p>Because when I'm not playing the game, people are attacking our tribe, okay, and that's a lot of pressure, that's a lot of stress.</p>
<p>It's too much for you.</p>
<p>And we could lose everything, we could lose everything that we have worked for-- everything!</p>
<p>I wasn't thinking.</p>
<p>No, you're not really the thinking kind, though.</p>
<p>I'm kind of the thinking one in the relationship, so... Right, thank you.</p>
<p>Be pretty, you know, talk to me right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get my energy balls.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee gasps)</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, we need to talk, dude.</p>
<p>(laughing): Well, well, well, if it isn't the soiled fool.</p>
<p>Frank told you about that?</p>
<p>Uh, no, everyone's talking about it online; it's hilarious.</p>
<p>You destroyed your computer, you bashed it to bits.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it got you in the eye-- is that what's going on there?</p>
<p>It bashed me back a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should win those fights, you shouldn't lose...</p>
<p>I did win, I did win, it just got a couple of good shots in.</p>
<p>It did, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, hey, listen, I want to tell you something.</p>
<p>Um, Dee... Yeah?</p>
<p>You're not going to offer our guest any?</p>
<p>Of course I-- of course, that's what I was doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Mac, hey, did you, did you want an energy ball or two?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Go ahead, have as many as you want-- is that enough?</p>
<p>That's-- yeah, that's good.</p>
<p>There you go, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, you need to fuel up.</p>
<p>Have a bunch of balls.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay-- don't touch.</p>
<p>No, now I know.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>I didn't mean that.</p>
<p>And stop groveling, just...</p>
<p>Let me know if you need...</p>
<p>You're not pretty when you do that, so...</p>
<p>Wow, you, like, totally psychologically, like, annihilated her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're good at building, I'm good at destroying.</p>
<p>We should totally team up.</p>
<p>Wait, you know what?</p>
<p>Can you do me a favor?</p>
<p>Can you watch her for a little while while I go meet a girl that I met online?</p>
<p>A real girl?</p>
<p>Yeah, a real girl.</p>
<p>She's probably fat, right?</p>
<p>Probably very fat, yeah.</p>
<p>If she's got any fat friends, I'm, I'm in.</p>
<p>If she has any fat friends, I'll let you know.</p>
<p>Or ugly.</p>
<p>Yeah, or ugly.</p>
<p>If they're sick, that's fine, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, or ugly or sick or, or male or female or whatever it is that you like.</p>
<p>That's not the point.</p>
<p>Like, the point is, you know how women get.</p>
<p>You know, she catches wind that I'm meeting a girl, she's going to go...</p>
<p>Oh, totally, totally.</p>
<p>I hate women.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I know that you feel that way, but do what I'm asking and then I can help you out with the game.</p>
<p>Okay, do what?</p>
<p>Watch Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Hello, hi.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>Come on, hello, hi.</p>

<p>You're five foot, nine.</p>

<p>What even is reality?</p>
<p>This is real.</p>
<p>(brays)</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>(British accent): What is real?</p>
<p>Is this real? Am I?</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm you.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>That's an amazing accent.</p>
<p>I like yours as well.</p>
<p>I think I know what reality is, but maybe I don't.</p>
<p>Everything in life is becoming more and more virtual.</p>
<p>Aw, don't be such a wanker.</p>
<p>Life is all in your mind.</p>
<p>If you believe it to be real, then it's real.</p>
<p>I'm so confused, British Dennis.</p>
<p>You create your own reality.</p>
<p>I've known beggars to be kings and kings to be beggars, all because they believed it so.</p>
<p>It's your choice.</p>
<p>It's my choice.</p>
<p>It's your universe.</p>
<p>It's my universe.</p>
<p>And you are God.</p>
<p>I... am... God.</p>
<p>Oh... oh... oh, no... okay.</p>
<p>Shh, shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>(sighs)</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>(moans)</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Julie, right?</p>
<p>The Queen of Thrones!</p>
<p>(chuckling)</p>
<p>The second most powerful player in the game.</p>
<p>And you are the Mighty Rat Slayer.</p>
<p>'Tis I, 'tis I!</p>
<p>It's nice to meet you!</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I haven't had a chance to tidy myself.</p>
<p>You know, when you're playing the game, you get caught up and...</p>
<p>Have a seat! Have a seat!</p>
<p>Wow, this is... It's cool to meet someone from the game, you know?</p>
<p>I brought you something.</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>It's nothing, really.</p>
<p>It's just, um... the best cheesecake in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>You dog!</p>
<p>Uh, I'll be the judge of that, all right?</p>
<p>You little rascal, you.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't normally meet people from the game, but you seem like such a nice guy.</p>
<p>Thanks, yeah, yeah, you know...</p>
<p>This is embarrassing, but I got you something too, you know?</p>
<p>I don't want... I don't want to make you feel weird but here.</p>
<p>Oh, how thoughtful.</p>
<p>I wonder what it is.</p>
<p>It's not much.</p>
<p>Just a box of spiders.</p>
<p>(screams) What the hell?</p>
<p>Well, while we've been sitting here, my followers have burned your land, they've raped your people, and they've destroyed your tribe.</p>
<p>You thought you could make a move on me, Queen of Thrones?</p>
<p>Well, you were wrong.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I just wanted to have lunch with you.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>Oh, let's have lunch because we're hungry and we want to eat food.</p>
<p>Bullshit!</p>
<p>You think I'd give up all this for lunch?</p>
<p>You stupid, fat pig.</p>
<p>I'm not fat.</p>
<p>No, you're not fat, but you were... you were supposed to be.</p>
<p>My friend Mac said you would be fat.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>You're a dick.</p>
<p>And your breath smells like dog food.</p>
<p>(shouts)</p>
<p>Whatever, you bitch!</p>
<p>I got the power now!</p>
<p>I'm doing good in the game, so I'm doing good in life!</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>Oh, look who's here.</p>
<p>Well, it's nice that you came.</p>
<p>A little overdressed.</p>
<p>You said that this was a classy affair, Frank.</p>
<p>It was a classy affair until you showed up.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>You bitch!</p>
<p>Where are your 101 Dalmatians tonight?</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>He's better at the zings than you!</p>
<p>All right, Dee, give me your phone, give me your headset-- I got to get back online ASAP.</p>
<p>I just made some big things happen.</p>
<p>Big things, baby!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>She's not with you anymore, bro.</p>
<p>Hold on. Shut up.</p>
<p>Wh-Why is the soiled fool talking to me?</p>
<p>I don't need you anymore, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'd like a divorce.</p>
<p>Ooh! Juicy!</p>
<p>Wait, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>I know you were gonna leave me for the Queen of Thrones, so I've slept with Mac to humiliate you.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>She's humiliated you and herself by sleeping with me.</p>
<p>I'm good at the game now.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, Dee, you stupid idiot.</p>
<p>Do you... do you have a brain in your head?</p>
<p>I was tricking that girl, so that I could destroy her tribe.</p>
<p>We're the most powerful tribe in the whole game now!</p>
<p>What are you doing?!</p>
<p>(gasps)</p>
<p>Uh... you know, I-I guess maybe I hadn't really thought the whole thing through.</p>
<p>No, you didn't think!</p>
<p>Because you don't think!</p>
<p>You're just a stupid kept housewife, okay?</p>
<p>Zing it, girl!</p>
<p>Frank, shut the hell up!</p>
<p>How dare you all conspire against me?</p>
<p>How dare you?!</p>
<p>You know what, I want everyone out.</p>
<p>Everyone get out of my apartment, okay?</p>
<p>No, not you, not you, and not you.</p>
<p>The three of you, sit!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>Okay, I think we can all agree that this game is the most important thing that ever happened to us, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah... It's very important...</p>
<p>That's the truth.</p>
<p>It's a hugely important thing!</p>
<p>So because I'm a nice guy, you know, 'cause I'm a cool dude, I'll let you live, all right?</p>
<p>But, Mac and Frank, you got to give me your shares of Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>And, Dee, you're gonna have to do all the Charlie-work in the bar from here until-- oh, I don't know-- how's eternity sound?</p>
<p>(bad British accent): Stop... This game has gone on long enough.</p>
<p>(normal voice): Uh, shit.</p>
<p>Are you doing an accent?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was doing a British acc...</p>
<p>It was a British accent.</p>
<p>That was British?!</p>
<p>Yeah, I had it so good in my head-- uh, I was doing a really good British accent.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter. Anyway... Charlie, you think you have all the power?</p>
<p>Well, you don't.</p>
<p>You see, the only thing bigger than a king is a god.</p>
<p>You think you're a god?</p>
<p>I'm the one who's thriving, Dennis.</p>
<p>I mean, look at me.</p>
<p>You look like you're covered in Hawaiian Punch.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>I am the god of my own universe, Charlie.</p>
<p>I decide my own reality, and I've decided all of your realities as well.</p>
<p>So, you see, I unplugged it.</p>
<p>You... unplugged reality?</p>
<p>I don't understand what he's saying.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>I just... I deleted all of your characters from the game.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I erased all your... people.</p>
<p>H-How did you do that?</p>
<p>Well, it was easy.</p>
<p>You guys all have the same password, "paddyspub."</p>
<p>Oh, that's my password for everything.</p>
<p>Mine, too.</p>
<p>Why would you do that though?</p>
<p>Why would you delete our characters?</p>
<p>Because the goddamn game was irritating to me.</p>
<p>I thought it was really stupid, and it really is just, you know, sort of that simple, so I ended the game, you know.</p>
<p>That's the end.</p>
<p>Doesn't have to be a whole big thing every single time, you know.</p>
<p>That's life.</p>
<p>That's just sort of how-how shit goes.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Sometimes things just sort of... end.</p>
