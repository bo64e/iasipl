<p>Sweet Dee (groans): Goddamn.</p>
<p>And how is the psoriasis coming?</p>
<p>Has it gotten any better?</p>
<p>Oh! It's not good, Doc, it's not good.</p>
<p>I'm scaling up like a goddamn boa constrictor over here.</p>
<p>Skin conditions can be manifestations of deeper issues.</p>
<p>Well, you're not a skin doctor, so let's drop it already, okay?</p>
<p>I got beef with you.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>I am mad at you!</p>
<p>Remember that cooperative dinner you had me have with my friends so we could try and resolve some of our issues?</p>
<p>Well, it blew up in my face.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Uh, screaming and tears and physical threats, uh, Frank pulled out his gun, somebody dropped the "N" bomb.</p>
<p>I don't remember where that came from, but it was messy.</p>
<p>No, I mean why did it all fall apart?</p>
<p>Oh. No one was assigned the dishes.</p>
<p>And that all happened over the dishes?</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em> And frankly, I haven't seen any results since I've been coming to you, so as far as I'm concerned, you're in the hot seat until you resolve this.</p>
<p>Resolve this...?</p>
<p>Who's going to do the dishes!</p>
<p>And also, this is a great opportunity for you to see how insane my asshole friends are.</p>
<p>You brought them here?</p>
<p>Of course I brought them here-- what, are you gonna come to my house?</p>
<p>Hey, assholes, get in here.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Did you guys sort it out?</p>
<p>Did you sort it out already?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: How long were we gonna sit out there for?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: All right, listen, lady, I'll tell you one thing.</p>
<p>I ain't doing these goddamn dishes!</p>
<p>Therapy is stupid.</p>
<p>I don't trust a shrink.</p>
<p>They screw with your head.</p>
<p>Frank, it's the only way to settle the argument and find out who is the winner.</p>
<p>Okay, uh... let me first just say that arguments do not have winners.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, actually, this argument is more about determining who the loser will be, because most of us will be winners.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and it's not gonna be me, okay?</p>
<p>I'm not doing those dishes, because I had the hardest job.</p>
<p>Setting the table?</p>
<p>Are you dumb?</p>
<p>I hosted!</p>
<p>It was wall-to-wall details!</p>
<p>I was on edge the whole time.</p>
<p>Well, it's gonna be you or Frank or Charlie, 'cause Dennis and I cooked.</p>
<p>The food was mush.</p>
<p>The food was divine.</p>
<p>It was pheasant.</p>
<p>I never did the dishes before and I'm not starting now.</p>
<p>I bankrolled; case closed.</p>
<p>Well, I had the hardest job of anyone-- I traveled all the way to this exotic merchant in search of this rare fowl...</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about, Charlie?</p>
<p>You went to the corner gourmet grocery store and you bought pheasant.</p>
<p>Okay. This is all, you know, a little bit unorthodox, but it is <em>clearly</em> about much more than just the dishes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's always levels.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, we're complex people, you know?</p>
<p>(several talking at once)</p>
<p>Our rivers run deep, and... I believe I can help you with this.</p>
<p>Let me stop you right there, actually, Doc-- I can help <em>you.</p>
<p>You see, I have a background in academic psych myself, from an Ivy League college, no less, not this, uh, LaSalle.</p>
<p>It sounds like a pasta dish.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>It does, it does.</p>
<p>But let's not be mean, Frank.</p>
<p>Some people don't have the same access that we do.</p>
<p>Now, use me as a resource.</p>
<p>Think of me as a colleague.</p>
<p>Now, I was thinking we could start with a few one-on-ones, you know, move on to a couple of mix-'em-ups, you know, and then end with a big group dealio.</p>
<p>I'm going first, please?</p>

<p>(laughter dies with moan)</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I was just thinking of something that Charlie said that was really funny.</p>
<p>Mac, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you often feel strong emotion felt in quick succession?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. And not just my emotions.</p>
<p>I have had a slight fluctuation with my weight recently.</p>
<p>I see. And how much weight are we talking about?</p>
<p>I gained and lost 60 pounds in three months.</p>
<p>Wow, that's almost impossible.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, through God, <em>all</em> things are possible, so jot that down.</p>
<p>And yeah, yeah, I had a difficult time there.</p>
<p>I had to buy all new clothes, and... people used to cross the street when I would walk by.</p>
<p>They'd be, like, "Whoa, look at that monster coming towards us, you know, barreling towards us."</p>
<p>Mac... you're not that guy anymore.</p>
<p>Don't you think I know that?</p>
<p>And I'm starting to think that I'll never become that monster again.</p>
<p>Oh, so you preferred being scary to people?</p>
<p>Yeah. Lady, I was as big as a skyscraper, and now I'm as tiny as a postage stamp.</p>
<p>Oh. I get it. Cute.</p>
<p>You leave this pen here and people are supposed to think, "Wait, that looks like a dick."</p>
<p>Mac, have you ever heard of the term "body dysmorphia"?</p>
<p>Is that what I have?</p>
<p>Is that what's making me so thin?</p>
<p>No. Body dysmorphia is when you see a distorted version of yourself that no one perceives but you.</p>
<p>Oh, but Dennis perceives it, too, because he's been giving me size pills to make me bigger.</p>
<p>Dennis is, like, my best buddy.</p>
<p>Well, oftentimes, drug don't address the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Talking through the issues may be the best way for you to address your mood swings and body issues.</p>
<p>Talking about it?</p>
<p>Talking about it!</p>
<p>No, that's good. That's good.</p>
<p>So if we talk about it, then you think that I'll get most bigger... from talking!</p>
<p>Oh, that's really good.</p>
<p>You know... thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for this.</p>
<p>You know, when I first walked in here, I was, like, "There's no way that this is gonna work,"</p>
<p>'cause I just do not get the whole woman doctor thing, but then when you started talking about God, I realized that you're one of the smart ones.</p>
<p>All right, let's do it, let's talk about it.</p>

<p>Back then, science was real crude.</p>
<p>They stuck us all together.</p>
<p>My roommate was a frog kid.</p>
<p>You ever see a frog kid?</p>
<p>Frog kid?</p>
<p>Yeah. The place was windowless.</p>
<p>There was a guard every ten feet.</p>
<p>All the rooms had drains in the floors so they could hose us down.</p>

<p>It's not about breaking.</p>
<p>It's about helping them.</p>
<p>Hmm. It's interesting, our thing, isn't it?</p>
<p>To be in someone's mind, to have complete control.</p>
<p>It's like the thrill of being near the executioner's switch, knowing that at any moment, you could throw it, but knowing you never will.</p>
<p>But you could.</p>
<p>Never isn't the right word, because I could, and I might.</p>
<p>I probably will.</p>
<p>Will you sit down, please?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Sorry.</p>
<p>Did I make you nervous?</p>
<p>Not my intention.</p>
<p>Well... (sighs)</p>
<p>So... who would you like to discuss first?</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>That's good, but we don't really have time for jokes, so let's jump right into it, shall we?</p>
<p>Now, I've long maintained psychological dossiers on every single one of those raving lunatics in your waiting room right now.</p>
<p>The top one, and the thickest, by far, is Charlie's, of course.</p>
<p>But I'd rather start... with Mac.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Start with a simple one.</p>
<p>Now, how did your session with him go?</p>
<p>Dennis, as I think you know, I'm not at liberty to discuss another patient.</p>
<p>Listen, why don't you think of me more as a peer, you know, in the academic sense, of course?</p>
<p>In terms of age, you're decades older than me.</p>
<p>But why don't I start, okay?</p>
<p>Um, if you'll open up your dossier there, you'll see there on the first page is something that you picked up on almost immediately, which is his reverse body dysmorphia.</p>
<p>And this... a well-placed pen, can have quite an effect on a man like him.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>This must have given him quite the thrill.</p>
<p>I bet he tried to suck on this.</p>
<p>Did he?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It's okay, Doc.</p>
<p>You can tell me.</p>
<p>He's always sucking on the pens in our apartment.</p>
<p>I'm always having to hide them.</p>
<p>Well, I showed you mine.</p>
<p>Why are some of these pages written in crayon?</p>
<p>My file on Dee was started in the second grade.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Interesting?</p>
<p>Tell me about these size pills you're giving Mac.</p>
<p>Well, now, that's more like it.</p>
<p>So they're Mexican ephedra.</p>
<p>Calling them size pills was an eloquent solution.</p>
<p>The guy was gross.</p>
<p>It was disgusting.</p>
<p>He was fat as shit, he smelled liked shit, he sounded like shit, his groans, his snores, the sleep apnea.</p>
<p>It was gross.</p>
<p>He was repulsive, really.</p>
<p>So he has no appetite because you're drug him, secretly.</p>
<p>Giving a man medicine for his disease-- wherever did I get that idea?</p>
<p>What are you writing?</p>
<p>Writing?</p>
<p>Oh, nothing.</p>
<p>Drawing.</p>
<p>Drawing conclusions.</p>
<p>And... drawing this.</p>
<p>You like it?</p>
<p>It's very generous.</p>
<p>Dee, I'm afraid I have a serious issue to discuss with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I cannot help you if you are lying in every session.</p>
<p>Lying?</p>
<p>Why would I be lying?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Why would you... where are you getting this?</p>
<p>Were you or were you not...</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>...the first choice for the female lead in The Notebook?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, I was and I had to, unfortunately, pass because of a scheduling conflict.</p>
<p>We... (laughs)</p>
<p>We went over this.</p>
<p>I graciously handed it to Rachel McAdams and she did a fine job with the film.</p>
<p>I'm secure enough to admit that.</p>
<p>I'm finding all this hard to believe.</p>
<p>(Brooklyn accent): Oh, what do you want to hear, Doc, huh?</p>
<p>That I had cigarettes put out on me when I was a kid?</p>
<p>That this isn't a surgery scar, huh?</p>
<p>That my father stabbed me? Huh?</p>
<p>Okay, let me interrupt you for a second, okay, because I think we have an example happening right before our eyes.</p>
<p>You're speaking right now with a Brooklyn accent and yet...</p>
<p>(normal voice): Boston.</p>
<p>It was a Boston accent.</p>
<p>The accent was clearly from Brooklyn.</p>
<p>This isn't a surgery scar.</p>
<p>No, you don't say scar.</p>
<p>That's clearly Brook... Yes, I did.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, the point is, Dee... &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It's a really good... Hmm?</p>
<p>...I just met your father and I think that little bit was from Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's not my father.</p>
<p>That's a whole can of worms.</p>
<p>I don't want to go into it.</p>
<p>But it was from Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>How-how did you enjoy it?</p>
<p>I'd rather discuss the father issue.</p>
<p>You know what, she really wasn't that great, now that I think about it.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Rachel McAdams.</p>
<p>Feel like I could've done a better job.</p>
<p>Do you think that I would've done a better job, with that Ryan Gosling?</p>
<p>I've never seen you act.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Uh... ta-da!</p>
<p>I've been lying the whole time!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>So, good, you admitted it.</p>
<p>Uh-uh, that</em> was acting.</p>
<p>What I just... right there was acting.</p>
<p>I said I was lying, and that wasn't even true.</p>
<p>That was acting.</p>
<p>All right, so uh!</p>
<p>You are... (laughing)</p>
<p>I am so... I'm good.</p>
<p>I am so... How are you feeling about all of what I'm doing?</p>

<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to do this the right way, Dennis.</p>

<p>Dennis, can I give you some advice?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Look, hey, do what you want to do in life, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Oh, what I want to do?</p>
<p>Mmm, well... that's what I want to do.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I applaud you for that.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
