<p>Something outside the box.</p>
<p>Come on, people.</p>
<p>You agree with me.</p>
<p>The shareholders meeting is next week.</p>
<p>If we don't act fast, this company will be stripped down and sold for scrap.</p>
<p>I say we cut a deal with the Wheeler Group.</p>
<p>You want to make a deal with the people who are threatening to gut us?</p>
<p>What choice do we have?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There is one man who can save this company.</p>
<p>Its founder.</p>
<p>(grumbling)</p>
<p>The man is from a different era.</p>
<p>He's a Neanderthal, an animal.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just the animal we need.</p>
<p>Bring in... the warthog.</p>
<p>(snorting)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hey, Frank, how do you know that these are crow's eggs?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Because I saw a crow.</p>
<p>(phone ringing) Hurry up.</p>
<p>I can't stay here much longer.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, there's a whole untapped world of bird eggs that we're not even taking advantage of.</p>
<p>Get the phone!</p>
<p>(grunts)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Is this the warthog?</p>
<p>I ain't heard that name in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Five, four, three, two, one!</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, boom, 24 hours is up.</p>
<p>The found wallet is ours.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Let's pop this bad boy open and see what we've won.</p>
<p>Mr. Brian LeFeve from Quebec, you lose.</p>
<p>Boom, I got your wallet.</p>
<p>Boom, I got your credit cards.</p>
<p>Boom, I got your money.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Is that Canadian?</p>
<p>Ah, throw it in the trash.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna throw it in the trash.</p>
<p>Might be worth more than ours.</p>
<p>We'll exchange it.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Phillies ticket.</p>
<p>For today!</p>
<p>Oh, shit, looks like we're going to the Phillies game.</p>
<p>Always check your breath.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>(panting)</p>
<p>And when you shake their hands, make sure your hands are bone dry.</p>
<p>Dry hands.</p>
<p>Never wet and clammy.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>Guys, quick announcement.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be popping these crow's eggs in the fridge here so they don't spoil.</p>
<p>Do not touch them.</p>
<p>They are ours.</p>
<p>We won't.</p>
<p>Guys, why are you dressed like that?</p>
<p>There's some scumbag company that's trying to take over the business that I founded, and I'm not gonna stand for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, we're not gonna stand for that.</p>
<p>Frank's taking me under his wing; he's gonna teach me how to swim with the sharks.</p>
<p>Charlie can't read.</p>
<p>He'll adapt.</p>
<p>He'll adapt to reading?</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, we don't need them, all right?</p>
<p>We have plenty of fun things to do today, okay?</p>
<p>That's right, while you guys are crunching numbers, we're gonna be soaking up some sun at the Phillies game, courtesy of one Mr. Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>Who the hell is that?</p>
<p>The guy whose wallet we found at the bar.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do if he comes looking for it?</p>
<p>Uh, tell him to suck a boner.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Boom, I got your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Boom, I got your credit cards.</p>
<p>Boom, I got your Phillies tickets.</p>
<p>(crowd cheering)</p>
<p>Yeah, I've never been in... Whoa.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Oh, fine dining and baseball food.</p>
<p>There's more.</p>
<p>Hey! Oh!</p>
<p>Free batteries!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.</p>
<p>Calm down, calm down.</p>
<p>What's in here?</p>
<p>Free shit, free shit.</p>
<p>Guys, calm down.</p>
<p>Look at all these coasters.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Act like you belong here.</p>
<p>Now listen to me.</p>
<p>The fact that we're in a box leads me to believe that there are definitely gonna be other people coming here today, and they're probably gonna be friends with this LeFeve guy.</p>
<p>So we need to talk about an exit strategy.</p>
<p>We don't want to get caught.</p>
<p>Okay, exit strategy.</p>
<p>All right, I'll run the op.</p>
<p>This the only entrance and/or exit, therefore if somebody comes in, I will spring off the balcony to safety.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That's a 50-foot drop.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, and I'm a professional, so I will tuck and roll.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gonna tuck and roll through a 50-foot drop?</p>
<p>Dennis, if I had a gun with me, I'd be spraying bullets into the air as I fell.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we don't have time for these types of scenarios, okay?</p>
<p>I'm talking about coming up with a real plan, a real exit strategy.</p>
<p>If we get caught, we could get in a lot of...</p>
<p>Excuse me, is one of you Brian LeFeve?</p>
<p>Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, hi.</p>
<p>It's nice to finally put a face to the name.</p>
<p>I'm Andrew Kane.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And Bill Larkin.</p>
<p>Oh, Bill, okay, now see, from our conversations, I would have pegged you for Bill. Crazy?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we get that sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>And that must make you Prudence LeFeve.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Hi, honey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>And you are?</p>
<p>Vic Vinegar, bodyguard.</p>
<p>I don't shake, so don't even try.</p>
<p>Bodyguard?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he's really more of a driver.</p>
<p>He drives us around.</p>
<p>I protect their bodies.</p>
<p>He protects the car.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we got all week to talk about business.</p>
<p>So, uh, let's just kick back and watch this game, huh?</p>
<p>Who needs a beer?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Oh, I'd love a beer.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Vic, you're working.</p>
<p>(laughs): You're working.</p>
<p>You are. A bodyguard, you got to drive, too, stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p>I'm not stupid. Not stupid.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Charlie, I want a list of the top ten shareholders of the company ASAP, and call the press.</p>
<p>Put out a press release.</p>
<p>Tell them the warthog is back in business.</p>
<p>Also, there are too many minorities and women working here. What's up with that?</p>
<p>I got all that. I'm on it.</p>
<p>I'm on it.</p>
<p>Excuse me, excuse me, who is this man?</p>
<p>Charles Kelly.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be advising the warthog in matters of business and all the what have you.</p>
<p>Oh, everything.</p>
<p>Right-hand man, you got it?</p>
<p>I mean, there's gonna be some changes around here, you understand?</p>
<p>Ah, look at this.</p>
<p>This poor kid, nobody's helping him.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, kid.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Sorry, sir.</p>
<p>The darn thing won't print.</p>
<p>You mind if I take a look-see?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I think it's a paper jam.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's the culprit.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr. Warthog.</p>
<p>A jam, it was in the tray three, and you didn't check.</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>It was hiding back there.</p>
<p>It was like a little piece of paper.</p>
<p>Let me... Whoa, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Did I just do your job for you?</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Did I? Did I just do your job for you?</p>
<p>(growling)</p>
<p>Uh, I-I guess so.</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Go on, pack your shit up and get out of here.</p>
<p>If we're gonna turn this company around, we got to start cutting the crust off this shit sandwich.</p>
<p>Fire in the hole, everybody.</p>
<p>Come on, work.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of our latest proposal, LeFeve?</p>
<p>I think closing at 31's a pretty fair deal, don't you?</p>
<p>31? Well, you know, guys, these things tend to be a little complicated.</p>
<p>(Canadian accent): Oh, I think ya can do better.</p>
<p>Oh, you looked over the proposal?</p>
<p>She glanced at it.</p>
<p>We're not... Tell us more about it.</p>
<p>Yah, I sure did, and I tell you what, I seen better-looking moose turds in Rick Moranis' backyard, ya hosers. Mm?</p>
<p>She's got a sense of humor that would just...</p>
<p>You know, it gets frustrating.</p>
<p>Hey, come talk to me for a second.</p>
<p>Excuse me, guys.</p>
<p>Just... (chuckles)</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing, Dee?</p>
<p>We're Canadian.</p>
<p>You sound like a cartoon character.</p>
<p>Guys, let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Everybody's treating me like the help.</p>
<p>Well, you should have thought about that before you blurted out, "bodyguard."</p>
<p>Mm. Oh, I got an idea.</p>
<p>Promote me to vice president.</p>
<p>That way, we can talk shop.</p>
<p>Mac, these gentlemen are courting me for my business savvy.</p>
<p>How's it gonna reflect on me if I promote my bodyguard to VP after a two-minute conversation at a ball game?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>It's not gonna reflect on you at all because you're not Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>I'm not what?</p>
<p>Dude, clearly you were floundering.</p>
<p>Mac, I was gathering information so that I can more fully become this man.</p>
<p>Look, look, this is about much more than just business.</p>
<p>This is about the thrill of wearing another man's skin.</p>
<p>Feeling his innermost wants and desires and being in control of his every single move.</p>
<p>That's how you get off.</p>
<p>Now don't you guys want to get off with me?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I want you to get off with me.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Just follow my lead.</p>
<p>Guys, we're gonna get off together.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I'm just confused about one thing.</p>
<p>Now, you got me out of bed, you put me on a plane, rolled out the red carpet for, what was it, 31?</p>
<p>Vic, get my coat.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Now hold on a second, LeFeve.</p>
<p>Give us a shot.</p>
<p>We will persuade you.</p>
<p>Get ready for a great week.</p>
<p>(bat hits ball, crowd cheers)</p>
<p>A little longer in the sock, huh?</p>
<p>Higher in the thigh. (chuckles)</p>
<p>So tell me the rundown for tomorrow, Charlie.</p>
<p>Okay. We got a 8:30 appointment in the morning to play racquetball in these new outfits, then we're gonna head over to Barneys, we're gonna shop for Rolexes.</p>
<p>After that, we zip by Atwater where you're having your office completely redone back to its former 1980's glory.</p>
<p>And then we have a 5:00 sushi dinner with Mr. Nakashori.</p>
<p>That all sound right?</p>
<p>Whoo! Sounds great, Charlie.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>Good. Well, Frank, I'm a little confused about one thing.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Who pays for all this?</p>
<p>What do you mean, who pays for it?</p>
<p>The company pays for it.</p>
<p>All right, well, then here's my second question.</p>
<p>What does Atwater make?</p>
<p>What do you mean, like, how much money does the company make?</p>
<p>Oh, no, I mean <em>what do we make?</p>
<p>I don't follow.</p>
<p>We make money.</p>
<p>No, I know we make money.</p>
<p>I mean, what do we create?</p>
<p>We create wealth.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, what do we build, what do we design, you know?</p>
<p>Because I have some ideas that could really help the company.</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, we don't build anything.</p>
<p>Leave that to the Chinks.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I want this sushi dinner to be the tits.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so you want it to be, like, really expensive.</p>
<p>No, I want to eat sushi off of some Jap broad's tits.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>All right, guys, listen, I whipped us up a couple of backstories here, so take a look at these cards.</p>
<p>On the front, you're gonna find your biographical information.</p>
<p>On the back, that's your emotional blueprint.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I have my own backstory, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'm an entrepreneurial bodyguard with his own line of fitness products.</p>
<p>I want to pitch the guys out.</p>
<p>No, no, guys, guy, please, you got to trust me, okay?</p>
<p>Just follow my lead, and I am gonna get you off in ways you never believed existed.</p>
<p>I'm in.</p>
<p>I'm not. I don't even know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>I just want to do some business stuff.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, LeFeve, we have a surprise you are gonna love.</p>
<p>Ah, really?</p>
<p>Trust me, we know exactly what you like.</p>
<p>Head on down to the members' locker room and see for yourself.</p>
<p>Dennis, I have business savvy.</p>
<p>I can be more than just the bodyguard, okay?</p>
<p>I've got ideas.</p>
<p>Oh, you got ideas?</p>
<p>Pitch me one of your ideas right now.</p>
<p>Right now?</p>
<p>Off the top of my head?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Um, bodyguards.</p>
<p>What about bodyguards?</p>
<p>Training bodyguards, putting them in a facility and...</p>
<p>What about them?</p>
<p>Oh, what about a resort?</p>
<p>That's a totally different thing.</p>
<p>Are you saying that because we're in a resort?</p>
<p>Stick to the one thing.</p>
<p>What about bodyguards?</p>
<p>A resort for bodyguards?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, you must be Mr. LeFeve?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>Surprise. I'm all yours.</p>
<p>I was told there'd just be one, but I can take both of you.</p>
<p>Might get a little sore, but I'll manage.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I'm out of here.</p>
<p>Okay. Wait. What?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, where you going?</p>
<p>LeFeve's into banging little Asian boys, so we're done, right?</p>
<p>If we're gonna do this thing, we need to see things through.</p>
<p>Dennis, are you gonna have sex with a tiny Asian boy?</p>
<p>I'm gonna see how far I can go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you with me?</p>
<p>No. No, I'm going to leave now.</p>
<p>That's your goddamn problem, pal, you don't know your limits 'cause you're not willing to push yourself.</p>
<p>I know my limits!</p>
<p>This is my limit. I quit.</p>
<p>You quit?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Well, guess what, pal, you can't quit 'cause you're fired, Vic!</p>
<p>You're out of here!</p>
<p>See? You got no commitment, Vinegar!</p>
<p>You're finished!</p>
<p>You're never gonna get anywhere in life!</p>
<p>All right, LeFeve, time to put your money where your mouth is.</p>
<p>Let's kick things up a notch.</p>
<p>So, only the ones set of clubs?</p>
<p>Yeah, you're a caddy.</p>
<p>Clubs... This is a golf...</p>
<p>Good. Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Well, that's better than what I was about to...</p>
<p>(chuckles) Whoo! Let me, um...</p>
<p>Give me a minute.</p>
<p>I need to switch gears.</p>
<p>I almost... Yeah.</p>
<p>Take your time.</p>
<p>Okay, first off, your dry cleaning's all done, the company jet's been upgraded.</p>
<p>I got rid of that piece of trash.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Okay, now, secondly, I found out who the controlling shareholder of Atwater is.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>The wallet they found?</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was probably there to see me.</p>
<p>Dennis has been going around pretending to be him, and stringing along the Wheeler guys.</p>
<p>This is great, Charlie.</p>
<p>We keep the Wheeler guys off our asses, and we fix Atwater!</p>
<p>Huh? Good move.</p>
<p>Right? Pretty good.</p>
<p>Oh, Nakashori's here.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is...</p>
<p>Hello, Mr. Nakashori.</p>
<p>(bad Japanese accent): Ah, welcome, welcome.</p>
<p>You bring us a great honor to join with us, and we have many a naked woman and the fish of pleasure for you...</p>
<p>Charlie, what are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you talking broken English for?</p>
<p>I thought they could understand me better if I...</p>
<p>No, no, no. Sit down.</p>
<p>Let's eat some sushi and we'll talk business later.</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>So... (clears throat)</p>
<p>A few interesting facts about our city.</p>
<p>Uh, there's been an abundance of crow eggs all around Philly.</p>
<p>Uh, and crows seem to be getting bigger.</p>
<p>By the year and the day, even.</p>
<p>And their eggs, of course, are getting bigger as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps our companies, with this information, could find a way to create some products off these new...</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie...</p>
<p>Excuse us.</p>
<p>Charlie, come here, listen to me.</p>
<p>Look at me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're fired.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you're not getting it.</p>
<p>It's not sinkin' in.</p>
<p>I don't get it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Where did you get that awesome insider info from, about Brian LeFeve, huh?</p>
<p>That was pretty big.</p>
<p>Well, that was good, Charlie.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>But you keep talking about products and quality and-and making things...</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You're out.</em></p>
<p>Well, thanks for the insider info, Mac, but that did not work.</p>
<p>Frank canned me.</p>
<p>He did?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>What a dick!</p>
<p>You know Dennis wouldn't even listen to my business ideas?</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>I'm brimming with all these great business ideas.</p>
<p>Oh, tell me about it.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I pitched so many good ideas... or I tried to, at least.</p>
<p>And Frank shoots 'em down, 'cause he doesn't care about...</p>
<p>I wish we could go into business together, you know?</p>
<p>That would be... that would be good, it would make sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I feel like you and I... you and I understand each other.</p>
<p>We click, you know?</p>
<p>I have to warn you, though, that it's all about the product for me.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's what I was saying to Frank the entire time.</p>
<p>That's what people care about, is the product.</p>
<p>It's all about the product, right?</p>
<p>He only cares about money.</p>
<p>Money has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It's about a... Oh... You and I are on the same page.</p>
<p>I know, we're always clicking with... And we have insane business savvy, and I feel like...</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I need to speak to the owners.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's us.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Does the name Brian LeFeve mean anything to you guys?</p>
<p>(indistinct talking)</p>
<p>Okay, LeFeve, enough.</p>
<p>We took you out the yacht, we took you to the zoo, we took you to that massage parlor and paid to have them jerk you both off.</p>
<p>The meeting's about to start.</p>
<p>We need to know, are you going to sell or not?</p>
<p>Guys, we are almost there.</p>
<p>I promise you, we are so close.</p>
<p>Oh, okay!</p>
<p>All right, I want to welcome all of you Atwater investors, and especially our controlling shareholder, Mr. Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>Thanks, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm very excited about your passion for the company, so let's get right down to business.</p>
<p>Not so fast!</p>
<p>There's something you all need to know about Atwater!</p>
<p>(laughing crazily)</p>
<p>Prepare to have your minds blown.</p>
<p>We got a video.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(rock music playing)</p>
<p>What up?</p>
<p>Are you ready for the best idea ever?</p>
<p>Do you have money?</p>
<p>Do you want even more money?</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>We've got a great idea for you.</p>
<p>I... no, I told you not to... stay out of my peripheral through the whole...</p>
<p>...two, one.</p>
<p>Fight Milk!</p>
<p>The first alcoholic, dairy-based protein drink for bodyguards... By bodyguard!</p>
<p>I drink it every morning so I can fight like the crow.</p>
<p>(bird cawing)</p>
<p>Just get out of the way.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>It's all about the product shot.</p>
<p>Where do I stand?</p>
<p>Don't do the whole... I wanted for them to see the whole... Fight Milk!</p>
<p>(bird cawing)</p>
<p>Crow's egg!</p>
<p>(bird cawing)</p>
<p>Milk!</p>
<p>(bird cawing)</p>
<p>Made fresh.</p>
<p>By bodyguards.</p>
<p>And Charlie.</p>
<p>What up?</p>
<p>Watch as profits soar high as a crow.</p>
<p>(cash register bell ringing)</p>
<p>(bird cawing)</p>
<p>(Mac caws)</p>
<p>Watch your profits soar high as a crow.</p>
<p>(Mac caws)</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Wait, I thought we said I was gonna...</p>
<p>Profits... Yeah, go with your right.</p>
<p>To the right hand.</p>
<p>Uh, anyway, who wants to invest?</p>
<p>So what's this got to do with Atwater?</p>
<p>Oh, nothing.</p>
<p>No, um, we just didn't want to lead with the Atwater news because we figured you wouldn't stick around to watch the video.</p>
<p>So what's the news?</p>
<p>Oh! Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Well, that's not Brian LeFeve!</p>
<p>(crowd murmuring)</p>
<p>This is Brian LeFeve.</p>
<p>(crowd gasping)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, apparently he came to the bar to talk to Frank, and I didn't recognize him from his picture in his wallet, but I did recognize it when I saw that dead face in the morgue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like, I remember that dude, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He came to the bar, and I remember he had to take a piss.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was having a couple drinks and then...</p>
<p>But Charlie was in the bathroom cleaning it out.</p>
<p>I was working.</p>
<p>I'm like, "Dude, take it out to the alley."</p>
<p>And then I guess he's out in the alley, he comes back in, he forgot his wallet.</p>
<p>Mac's like, "ID please."</p>
<p>Yeah, he doesn't get in without an ID.</p>
<p>That's just the rule.</p>
<p>The guy's got no ID, so now he's roaming around the alleyway looking for his wallet.</p>
<p>Crackhead comes up to him, says, "Hey, man, give me your money."</p>
<p>And the guy's like, "I can't, I got no money."</p>
<p>And he's like, "Bullshit."</p>
<p>He got stabbed a bunch around the abdomen and... uh, kind of bled out and sort of died.</p>
<p>Why do you got his finger?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Well, the whole finger thing is...</p>
<p>This was a miscommunication.</p>
<p>This is a stupid thing, man.</p>
<p>This guy here... He's like, "Dude, get a fingerprint."</p>
<p>And I heard, "Get a fingertip."</p>
<p>And I chopped his finger off really quick and then I'm like, "Is this what you want?"</p>
<p>He starts screaming, you know.</p>
<p>Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>If Brian LeFeve is dead... then who the hell are these people?</p>
<p>Just a couple of people who totally got off, bro.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You did?</p>
<p>Mm... Are you serious?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, yeah.</p>
<p>Just... during this?</p>
<p>(whoops)</p>
<p>Big time, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I got off a couple times when we were watching the video presentation.</p>
<p>Then when he called me out for not being Brian LeFeve?</p>
<p>Whoo, that got me big time.</p>
<p>That did it?</p>
<p>Oh, man, did I get off.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then he showed the finger.</p>
<p>That was the big one.</p>
<p>A dead finger got you off.</p>
<p>That was the climax, really.</p>
<p>I am so confused.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, it was amazing.</p>
<p>It was mostly sexual.</p>
<p>God damn you, okay?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I could've gotten some cash out of these men.</p>
<p>I could've gotten a free pair of shoes, but no, you said, "Hang in there, I'll help you get off, I'll help you get off, Dee.</p>
<p>I'll show you how to do it."</p>
<p>And then you leave me all on my own to try and just get off all by myself without even... I did everything that I could.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you couldn't get off.</p>
<p>It's not my fault.</p>
<p>Some women just don't know how.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Sometimes it's only the guy who gets off.</p>
<p>Well, look, I don't know what the hell's going on over there.</p>
<p>But I can tell you something, that there is something really, palpable, wonderful going on over here.</p>
<p>I love this company.</p>
<p>I love it more than life.</p>
<p>I built this company with these hands.</p>
<p>Built it from the ground up.</p>
<p>This is a comp... (cell phone ringing)</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>It's done?</p>
<p>Oh. Good.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right, that's it. It's over, you can all go.</p>
<p>The company's gone.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I stripped the company, sold it to the Chinks, and they shut it down.</p>
<p>In a sense, you're all fired.</p>
<p>Out.</p>
<p>You can all go.</p>
<p>Thank you, and good-bye.</p>
<p>Get out, get out, go.</p>
<p>Frank, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>I... dude, I do not understand.</p>
<p>I thought you loved the company.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But not more than money.</p>
<p>And I just made a shitload of it.</p>
<p>You get it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, Charlie?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, tell me more about this Crowtein.</p>
