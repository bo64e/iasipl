<p><strong>All</strong>: Burn! Burn! Burn!</p>
<p>Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!</p>
<p>Burn! Burn! Burn!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hey! Burn, burn! Burn!</p>
<p>Yeah, cool.</p>
<p>What are you guys burning?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Bunch of garbage <em>and burns the tar</em> that's just taking up space.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: No, goddamn it!</p>
<p>Wait, Frank, why are you burning our photo album pictures?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Because it's trash.</p>
<p>You kidding me? Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Dude, these are all the pictures from our Jersey Shore vacations.</p>
<p>You were gonna burn these?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>These were, like, the happiest days of our lives.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Jersey Shore sucked.</p>
<p>The Shore didn't suck, Frank.</p>
<p>You sucked, okay?</p>
<p>You just complained the whole time and ruined it for everyone else.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I had to do all the work.</p>
<p>I never got to relax.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I would love to go on a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, my God, me, too.</p>
<p>I would love to go on a vacation.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not to the Jersey Shore, though.</p>
<p>I mean, that place sounds like a nightmare.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the Jersey Shore?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You've seen that TV show.</p>
<p>It's just a bunch of sweaty Guidos getting hopped up on energy drinks and giving each other diseases.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, the Jersey Shore is nothing like that.</p>
<p>It's a magical place where people swim in the ocean and they get to ride on fun rides and they get to have their first kiss.</p>
<p>Dude, you would love it.</p>
<p>Well, hang on a second.</p>
<p>I've never seen the ocean.</p>
<p>I could get into that if you guys want to go down to the Shore.</p>
<p>Aw, yes!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>We should all go to the Shore together.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll knock myself out and we'll head down to the Shore.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I feel like you're just gonna screw it up if you try and knock yourself out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're probably gonna come to halfway there, and then complain the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Why don't I take the rag, I'll get the chloroform, I'll get you when you least expect it.</p>
<p>All right, sweet.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Goin' down to the Jersey Shore!</p>
<p>Yeah, going to the Shore, baby!</p>
<p>Now, this ocean, explain it to me.</p>
<p>It's, like, it goes on forever?</p>
<p>Go to sleep, go to sleep.</p>
<p>(Charlie grunts)</p>
<p>So, I woke up, like, halfway there, and then you just snuffed me out again, huh, Mac?</p>
<p>Oh, this place turned into a major shithole.</p>
<p>It does not look exactly the way I remember it looking.</p>
<p>No, no, it's different, it's different.</p>
<p>The guy at the front desk said there was meth lab explosion, so the hotel burned down.</p>
<p>They had to rebuild it.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>There's a smell, too, like...</p>
<p>Don't sweat it, you guys.</p>
<p>Listen, with any luck at all, we won't be spending any time here, so just think of it more like a locker.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, is no one gonna talk about Dee's hair?</p>
<p>Oh, I was waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>I just didn't know what our cue was.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was waiting for Dennis to jump on top of it.</p>
<p>And then we were gonna slay her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no. It's fine.</p>
<p>All the cool girls get their hair braided at the Shore.</p>
<p>I think she looks like Bo Derek.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dennis.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. You see, Dee and I have some very fond memories of the Shore.</p>
<p>We're not gonna have you sullying those great memories with all your goddamn insults.</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>Are you drinking sunscreen?</p>
<p>No, no, it's a decoy.</p>
<p>We're drinking tequila out of sunscreen bottles.</p>
<p>Very strict open container laws here at the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>Is that the ocean?!</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, buddy, that's the ocean.</p>
<p>What's on the other side of it there?</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, how long would it take...?</p>
<p>Do not try and swim to Europe.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Don't swim to Europe?</p>
<p>Do not.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, why don't you stick with Dee and I because we can show you the ropes here at the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, you know what time it is!</p>
<p>Let's go strut the beach.</p>
<p>Not strutting shit.</p>
<p>No beach strutting for me.</p>
<p>I'm gonna find a place to relax and unwind.</p>
<p>Frank, I'm with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why don't you grab us some booze?</p>
<p>I'll go down to the beach and get us some prime real estate before those gorilla dickheads get down there.</p>
<p>Yeah. Gonna relax.</p>
<p>Let's do it!</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Oh, man, this ocean breeze feels so good on my scalp.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels awesome.</p>
<p>The sand feels good beneath my feet.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I'm a little curious as to where all the people are, though.</p>
<p>No idea, no idea.</p>
<p>Didn't want to say anything, didn't want to ruin the mood, but where are the people?</p>
<p>I'm seeing a lot more dogs than people, right?</p>
<p>There are a shit-ton of dogs out here, I tell ya.</p>
<p>Where are their masters?</p>
<p>I don't think these dogs have masters.</p>
<p>I think these dogs play by their own rules.</p>
<p>Well, clearly, the action has shifted elsewhere.</p>
<p>Want to go to the boardwalk?</p>
<p>Hey, let's go to the boardwalk!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Yeah! Hey, Charlie!</p>
<p>Charlie!</p>
<p>Come here!</p>
<p>(Charlie laughing)</p>
<p>Dude, oh, my God, this place is amazing!</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>And the sun block drink?</p>
<p>Nice, guys.</p>
<p>They're really good.</p>
<p>They're really good.</p>
<p>Thing is, I didn't make you one.</p>
<p>Oh! Jesus Chris, Charlie!</p>
<p>You're drinking sun block.</p>
<p>It's good. It gets you, it gets you all (grunts).</p>
<p>Yeah, you're ingesting viscous chemicals, and they're getting you high.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Okay, we're going to the boardwalk.</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>You want to leave?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like we're just scratching the surface of all the cool shit out here.</p>
<p>What cool shit?</p>
<p>Well, the sea specimens, the stray dogs, the trash that floated over from Europe.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we didn't come here to play with stray dogs and trash, man.</p>
<p>We came here to soak up the culture.</p>
<p>And the boardwalk is the cultural center of the Jersey Shore, so let's go there.</p>
<p>Come on, man!</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Goin' to the boardwalk.</p>
<p>Yo, Mac, you see that sign there that says "Taxic spill"?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Disregard that, Frank.</p>
<p>It's a bunch of liberal bullshit.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>This is a nice spot.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Whoa!</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>You were supposed to get booze.</p>
<p>Oh, this is ham soaked in rum.</p>
<p>It is loaded with booze.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Frank, eating your drinks?</p>
<p>That is genius!</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What the... What the...</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I got stuck with a needle.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a syringe.</p>
<p>Be careful. They are everywhere.</p>
<p>The beach is full of syringes.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, we're in the steroid capital of the world, Frank.</p>
<p>To be honest with you, as a man who works very hard to maintain a certain level of physical excellence, I find shortcuts insulting.</p>
<p>Now give me a piece of ham now.</p>
<p>Hey, check that out.</p>
<p>What the hell's a dog doing here?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, get out of here!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>Goddamn dogs, I'm telling you, dude.</p>
<p>The were lurking before, now they're swarming.</p>
<p>I'm not sharing my ham with no dogs.</p>
<p>I got a great idea.</p>
<p>Hey, warm sun, cool ocean breezes, getting rip-shit on ham.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Might you say we're getting "hammered."</p>
<p>Oh, nice one. (laughs)</p>
<p>This is a great idea, Frank.</p>
<p>Great idea.</p>
<p>This is 90-proof ham.</p>
<p>Screw you mutts!</p>
<p>(dogs barking)</p>
<p>Get out of here, you bitch!</p>
<p>Come and get it.</p>
<p>Stupid dogs.</p>
<p>We outsmarted those dogs, Frank.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Dude, this is the boardwalk, man.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's a little bit more desolate than I was hoping it would be, but...</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's okay.</p>
<p>It's still really great.</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, there's all kinds of rides and games and opportunities to win stuffed toys.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, the boardwalk is a blast, man.</p>
<p>But it is under the boardwalk where the action really happens.</p>
<p>Trust me, pal.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, what's down there?</p>
<p>Oh, Charlie, come on.</p>
<p>So under the boardwalk's where it's at?</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>This is gonna knock your socks off.</p>
<p>You never know who you're going to run into, what they're gonna be doing.</p>
<p>You love the bridge, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is a lot like being under the bridge, I would think.</p>
<p>It's way better than that.</p>
<p>Under the boardwalk is a magical place, man.</p>
<p>I have a special place in my heart 'cause I had my first kiss down here.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>Oh, dude, all kinds of romantic shit happens... Oh, God!</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>No! What was that?!</p>
<p>Two homeless guys banging each other.</p>
<p>I saw, but why?</p>
<p>That's not magical.</p>
<p>That's not romantic.</p>
<p>That's your idea of romantic?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>There are other kinds of romances that happen under here.</p>
<p>I don't want to see anything else like that.</p>
<p>You know what, I'm out of here.</p>
<p>'Cause you guys are perverted.</p>
<p>You get out of here.</p>
<p>You get out of here.</p>
<p>You get out of here, Charlie.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Aw!</p>
<p>Where's the beach?</p>
<p>Frank, wake up.</p>
<p>What? What's the matter?</p>
<p>Where's the beach?</p>
<p>Uh, I don't know.</p>
<p>We're in the middle of the goddamn ocean!</p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, we're going to conk out for a while and let the current gently roll us back to shore.</p>
<p>Frank, the current is what brought us out here in the first place.</p>
<p>If anything, we should be paddling against it to get back to the beach.</p>
<p>I'm going to pretend like I didn't hear that.</p>
<p>Frank, Frank, we are no longer in relaxing mode.</p>
<p>We are now in survival mode.</p>
<p>Will you stop being so dramatic?</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Where's the rum ham?</p>
<p>Where's the rum...?</p>
<p>Aw!</p>
<p>Rum ham!</p>
<p>No, Frank, stay in the boat.</p>
<p>Rum ham!</p>
<p>Frank, stay in the boat.</p>
<p>I want rum ham!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, rum ham.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, rum ham.</p>
<p>Oh, rum ham.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is going to be great, right?</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p>Nothing like some good, innocent, wholesome, above-the-boardwalk fun to, uh, get us back on track.</p>
<p>Yes. Take a step back from the situation.</p>
<p>Get a clearer perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then we'll plummet 20 stories and the rush will propel us forward into an awesome evening.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And hopefully cleanse us of the horrifying events that we've just witnessed.</p>
<p>These beads are really digging into my back.</p>
<p>Wind... I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know if we should have come back here.</p>
<p>I think we made a mistake, because we have so many memories... Oh, no.</p>
<p>Is my hair stuck?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It feels it's.... Yeah?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, get it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Get it out, because we're about to drop...</p>
<p>Get it!</p>
<p>Stick your hand... You think I'm going to stick my fingers into the machinery?</p>
<p>Hey, hey, you down there.</p>
<p>Do not make it go, because my hair is stuck, and something terrible will happen.</p>
<p>Oh, that's really in there.</p>
<p>Oh, you idiot, stop the ride!</p>
<p>(voice slows down): Don't make it fall!</p>
<p>(screaming)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>

<p>Hey.</p>
<p>How you holding up, sis?</p>
<p>Not well, Dennis. Not well.</p>
<p>Do you have any id how horrifying it was to ride that back up to get my hair?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, be thankful you got it back.</p>
<p>I just want to get my scalp sewnack on and get the hell out of this miserable town.</p>
<p>I'm starting to wonder what the hell we ever saw in this place, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I mean, look at this girl.</p>
<p>What's her story?</p>
<p>She's got a decent bone structure.</p>
<p>She was probably very pretty when she was young.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably spent her summers here, lounging on the beach and scooping ice cream.</p>
<p>But she didn't want her summers to end, so she got herself a fake I.D. and a push-up bra and started hanging out at the local bars.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Developed a nasty coke habit, 'cause she loved the way it made her feel.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Extreme highs gave way to extreme lows and she fell into a depression.</p>
<p>Had herself a kid.</p>
<p>Thought it would give her a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>And it did, for a while, until she started using again.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And then social services came knocking at the door, and now the kid lives upstate with his grandparents, 'cause she can't take care of this kid.</p>
<p>And here she is festering away in a one-bedroom apartment waiting for the HIV to turn into AIDS.</p>
<p>And wondering what the hell...</p>
<p>You know I can hear you, right?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>We were just using you as a metaphor, though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We didn't mean anything personal.</p>
<p>Don't sweat it.</p>
<p>You're not that far off.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, baby.</p>
<p>Jesus, are you seeing this?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>God, even the doctors in this town are drug dealers.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, wait.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>(growling)</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Where did you come from?</p>
<p>Get out of here.</p>
<p>Drop it.</p>
<p>No. Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn you!</p>
<p>I hate this town, Dennis.</p>
<p>I hate this town.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, all right, well calm down.</p>
<p>It's understandable.</p>
<p>You are missing a piece of your scalp.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sounds like you two could use a break.</p>
<p>Want to come party with me and my friends?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>I'm so thirsty.</p>
<p>Gargle some more water, bitch.</p>
<p>I've been gargling.</p>
<p>Well, don't snap at me.</p>
<p>Well, quit acting so bossy.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, guy, we can't fight, all right?</p>
<p>We're both very cranky.</p>
<p>We haven't eaten in a very long time.</p>
<p>I'm starving.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, look, maybe I'll dive down there, I'll spear a tuna, I'll wrestle him on board and we'll feast.</p>
<p>Boom, let's eat.</p>
<p>All right, give me the knife.</p>
<p>I can't give you the knife.</p>
<p>What? Why not?</p>
<p>'Cause there may come a time when difficult decisions must be made, and I'd rather be the one with the knife.</p>
<p>What difficult decisions?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know, like things you do to stay alive.</p>
<p>Are you talking about killing and eating me, Frank?</p>
<p>All I'm saying is, that when you go into survival mode, it's every man for himself.</p>
<p>You seem like you're in survival mode right now.</p>
<p>Maybe I am, maybe I ain't, rum ham.</p>
<p>Did you just call me rum ham?</p>
<p>Frank, Frank, we cannot be talking about killing and eating each other already, okay?</p>
<p>Tell that to the rum ham.</p>
<p>Stop talking about the goddamn rum ham.</p>
<p>It should have been you!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Jesus... (air hissing)</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>You see what you've done?</p>
<p>You've murdered us both, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, what's that?</p>
<p>It's a boat!</p>
<p>It's a boat!</p>
<p>We're saved!</p>
<p>(both laughing)</p>
<p>Is that an Italian flag?</p>
<p>It's the Guidos.</p>
<p>Guidos, we're here.</p>
<p>Over here.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>Charlie?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, what are you doing down here?</p>
<p>Did you follow me all the way to the Jersey Shore?</p>
<p>No! No, I swear.</p>
<p>I'm just out here... but that's cool!</p>
<p>Can you believe we're...</p>
<p>That's like destiny!</p>
<p>What... What's in your hand?</p>
<p>Something stupid I found.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>Can I see it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That's really beautiful.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>I'll tell you what, I mean...</p>
<p>I think that's a pretty rare one, but you can keep it if you want.</p>
<p>Thanks, Charlie.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>(laughs)</p>
<p>So you going to insult me and walk away?</p>
<p>Or, or what's going on here?</p>
<p>No, I, um...</p>
<p>I don't, I don't know, you know?</p>
<p>I love the beach so much, and it's so beautiful.</p>
<p>I could probably just hang out here for a little while.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Just don't go under the boardwalk.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Guys, this is Dennis and Dee.</p>
<p>I told them they could roll with us tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, hi.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're, uh, looking forward to partying with you all tonight.</p>
<p>Does Bobby know about this?</p>
<p>Don't worry, they're cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, uh... what are we getting into tonight, you guys?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Just waiting for Bobby.</p>
<p>Then we're gonna hit the liquor store.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you can't have a party without liquor.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Let's hit the liquor store.</p>
<p>(Dee gasps)</p>
<p>(giggles nervously)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: Who the hell are these two?</p>
<p>Well, you're Bobby, I guess.</p>
<p>Uh, we are just new acquaintances of your friend Stephanie over here.</p>
<p>Harmless people.</p>
<p>You guys cool?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I hate to toot my own horn, but I am pretty cool, Bobby.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<p>Hit that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I can tell by the way you're staring at me that you're wondering if I'm cool, too.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I'm just going to go ahead and nip that in the bud right now, so...</p>
<p>(Dee groans)</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>That does not taste like weed.</p>
<p>It burns a lot.</p>
<p>It's angel dust.</p>
<p>Angel... Dust.</p>

<p>Then... Okay, why am I waking up next to you on a deserted beach?</p>
<p>'Cause we fell asleep here last night.</p>
<p>What's going on with you?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. I was...</p>
<p>I was on Ecstasy last night, Charlie.</p>
<p>You have to tell me everything that happened.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Boy, you're really off the wagon, huh?</p>
<p>Drinking, drug... Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Well, it was a cool night.</p>
<p>I mean, we laughed, we collected sea specimens, we drank some ocean, you got a little sick from drinking the ocean.</p>
<p>I loved it, though.</p>
<p>That sounds really weird and gross.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Well, I suppose now you think this is weird and gross.</p>
<p>Oh my God, Charlie, come on!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Hang on a second, where you going?</p>
<p>Uh, let's see.</p>
<p>Last night I lived out one of my actual nightmares.</p>
<p>So I'm going to go, and take a shower.</p>
<p>Well, hang on.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>I suppose you want this back.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>That's a jewel you gave me.</p>
<p>You said you wanted me to have it.</p>
<p>Charlie, that's a piece of a broken glass bottle.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I'll see you Friday or something.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I guess that's just summer love.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Bro, our night was way more amazing.</p>
<p>And it actually happened.</p>
<p>What do you mean, it actually happened?</p>
<p>Why do you keep saying that?</p>
<p>You don't think I spent the night with the waitress?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Then where'd I get this, dude?</p>
<p>Where'd I get that?</p>
<p>I assume you got it out of the trash, or dug it out of a storm drain somewhere.</p>
<p>I don't believe you're not...</p>
<p>Whoa! Here they come.</p>
<p>Okay. All right.</p>
<p>Everyone get in the car!</p>
<p>Go, let's go!</p>
<p>Get in the car!</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on!</p>
<p>Guys, you will not believe the night we had!</p>
<p>I don't care, there is no meaning to life anymore.</p>
<p>It takes a classy man to admit when he was wrong.</p>
<p>And I was wrong. I love the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>Oh, you love it?</p>
<p>Oh, you love it so much here, get in the goddamn car, you fat fat ass, fat fat ass.</p>
<p>We hang out with these Jersey dudes.</p>
<p>Oh, man, they talk awesome.</p>
<p>I don't know why these guys get such a bad rep. It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, Mac.</p>
<p>There are far worse people in Jersey Shore than the cast of The Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>It's a horrible town. It's a horrible town filled with horrible people.</p>
<p>I don't know about that.</p>
<p>I think it's a magical town.</p>
<p>Hell yeah.</p>
<p>Beautiful magical town.</p>
