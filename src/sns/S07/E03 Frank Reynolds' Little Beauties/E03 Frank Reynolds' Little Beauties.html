<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, we never had kings in this country.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: No, I don't think we ever had kings.</p>
<p>That was the whole point of this country is that we didn't want a king.</p>
<p>We didn't want the king.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p>(Frank grunts)</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>I think you broke your nose.</p>
<p>I'm screwed. I'm screwed. Ah!</p>
<p>Oh, strange man, titty bar.</p>
<p>A great investment opportunity.</p>
<p>Beauty pageant.</p>
<p>Are you getting it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think I got this.</p>
<p>You met a strange man at a titty bar who offered you a great opportunity to invest in a beauty pageant?</p>
<p>Everything looked very legit.</p>
<p>It was all in place.</p>
<p>He had all the connections.</p>
<p>He wanted somebody to front the money.</p>
<p>Me. Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to do a beauty pageant.</p>
<p>Stop. Why?</p>
<p>Because you make a lot of cash, and you ogle some broads.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't question that aspect of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems right up your alley, bro.</p>
<p>Oh, this jerk gets pinched for coming on to one of the contestants, and now it looks like a whole scam.</p>
<p>And if I don't legitimize this thing, everybody's gonna think I'm just like him.</p>
<p>Why don't you just drop the whole thing?</p>
<p>I can't, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's already going.</p>
<p>It's in motion.</p>
<p>I mean, it's really a mess.</p>
<p>Any second now, there's gonna be broads walking through that door in swimsuits.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>That's a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't see what the problem is here, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh! Looks like somebody forgot their swimsuit.</p>
<p>Come on, girls.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>A kids' pageant.</p>
<p>I didn't know...</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>I didn't know it was a kids' pageant.</p>
<p>The guy didn't make that clear.</p>
<p>Now I'm lumped in with a diddler.</p>
<p>What am I gonna do?</p>
<p>This is a mess.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what the big deal is.</p>
<p>You know, I did pageants all the time when I was little.</p>
<p>The big deal?</p>
<p>The big deal is that mothers force their kids into this so that they can dress them up like dolls and parade them around like sex objects.</p>
<p>It's creepy.</p>
<p>My mother didn't force me into it.</p>
<p>I entered them myself.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's true.</p>
<p>Actually, when Dee used to enter pageants when we were kids, Mom used to tell her not to waste her time, because she isn't pretty enough.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, she would say that, and then I would jam it right in her face when I'd win them.</p>
<p>How would you win pageants?</p>
<p>Did you have a different face?</p>
<p>No, she was a dog back then, too.</p>
<p>It's just that she worked at it.</p>
<p>She used to go to tanning, and you know, she practiced with her makeup.</p>
<p>I'll give you that-- you did a lot of that practicing.</p>
<p>Thanks, Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you guys got to change your thinking about child pageants.</p>
<p>I mean, child pageants-- that's American tradition right there.</p>
<p>Child pageantry.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>In other countries, okay, women that can't show their ankles, right?</p>
<p>They got to be in those big, black tarps or whatever.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>In America, we can show toddlers in tiny bikinis, we can make them tan, because that's our right.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>As Americans, okay.</p>
<p>Child pageantry is an essential part of the American fabric.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We should dress up our little kids just to show other people that we can.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I never thought about it that way.</p>
<p>This is about freedom, isn't it?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>We can do whatever we want with our kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that's what America is all about.</p>
<p>You know what you just did, Charlie?</p>
<p>You just loaded up that train with coal, and now it's ready to tear down the tracks.</p>
<p>That was inspiring as hell.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I'm glad he's gonna observe us.</p>
<p>I mean, somebody should be looking out for these kids.</p>
<p>Yeah, those mothers just left their kids here in a bar with complete strangers in a pageant that's under investigation.</p>

<p>I love the kids.</p>
<p>Not in a sexual way.</p>
<p>No, I was married 20 years, and she was a bitch, but she was old, and I never had a problem getting it up with her.</p>
