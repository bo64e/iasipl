<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been one week since my last confession.</p>
<p>Okay, my son. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, what is your confession?</p>
<p>I'm fat.</p>
<p>Oh, great and angry God, I command thee to smite my friends!</p>
<p>Now, calm down, son.</p>
<p>Calm down.</p>
<p>Let's try and remain composed.</p>
<p>Okay, Father.</p>
<p>I'll try, but I can't promise anything 'cause I'm pretty excitable.</p>
<p>Also, I'm super pissed because my friends made me fat.</p>
<p>How did your friends make you fat?</p>
<p>Were they force-feeding you?</p>
<p>Well, no, not exactly.</p>
<p>This whole thing started because we became incredibly successful, and then they became monsters, which in turn made them make me fat.</p>
<p>So, really, I'd like to confess on them, because they're sinners and pricks.</p>
<p>Son, I don't think you understand the purpose of confession.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sorry, Father.</p>
<p>You need the context.</p>
<p>Let me start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Now, my friends and I own and operate a bar in South Philly.</p>
<p>And a few weeks ago, we became more successful than we ever have before.</p>
<p>It was insane.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p>Look who's back!</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>I scored a shitload of fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: Out of my way, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>North Carolina-- what a hell of a state.</p>
<p>Not now, Frank.</p>
<p>We're packed.</p>
<p>What the shit is going on around here?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I really don't get it.</p>
<p>Were we doing anything different?</p>
<p>Guys, we may have tipped.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>No, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>This is what happens with success in business.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Okay, if you keep making the right decisions over time, eventually you will get to a point where you tip, and you become successful.</p>
<p>It's like that book <em>The Tipping Point.</p>
<p>I totally buy that.</p>
<p>I totally-- like, check out this decision.</p>
<p>I keep a very clean bar every day, very tidy.</p>
<p>I think people respond to that.</p>
<p>They say, "What was that clean bar I was at the other week?"</p>
<p>And then they show up again.</p>
<p>And then someone says, "Hey, did you see that clean bar?</p>
<p>Let's go there."</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And my comedy, you know.</p>
<p>Like, all my, all my funny jokes and stuff that I throw out.</p>
<p>You know, I'm like the cute, funny waitress who has all these one-liners and hilarious jabs I throw at the customers, and I add all that charm to the place.</p>
<p>That's-That's probably doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, good-looking guy like myself, takes pride in his personal appearance, takes pride in his personal hygiene, has great hair.</p>
<p>You know, you put a guy like that behind the bar, and people will eventually flock to this man.</p>
<p>That-That's what you're saying, yeah.</p>
<p>That's what you're saying.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>I didn't think it was...</p>
<p>No, the point is that we got to keep doing what it is that we do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No matter how psychotically vain...</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>...or needy and pathetic or, I mean, just plain sad.</p>
<p>Well, let's not put labels on it, 'cause we don't know which one is the one that is the most...</p>
<p>If we keep doing all of it...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>...then we'll keep tipping up.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>In order to maintain this success, I do think though we need to get some rest.</p>
<p>Let's do the right thing here for once in our lives, and let's go home and get a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>But that sleep would never come, Father, because success was about to change everything.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, you asleep?</p>
<p>Charlie, are you asleep?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>I had a great idea.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear it.</p>
<p>Frank, I'm a successful man now, okay?</p>
<p>I need to maintain a certain level of excellence, so I can't have you, like, telling me terrible ideas all night, 'cause that brings me off my excellence, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, but this is a great idea.</p>
<p>I don't want to...</p>
<p>We take, we take the M-80s that I have, and we stic'em in some lamb and pa-cha, we blow it up!</p>
<p>What are you looking to do?</p>
<p>Like, flash-cook a-a gyro sandwich?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>Flash-cook a sandwich.</p>
<p>Oh, my God...</p>
<p>Cook the meat immediately.</p>
<p>I mean, what you're talking about is just a meat bomb, and that's a waste of a good lamb.</p>
<p>So if you're done with coming up with terrible ideas, um, I'm going to go back to bed.</p>
<p>A meat bomb!</p>
<p>You-You blow it up.</p>
<p>I mean, like, just take the thing and stick it...</p>
<p>(makes explosion noise)</p>
<p>(screaming wildly)</p>
<p>I'm going to the crevice!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, don't go in the crevice.</p>
<p>Charlie, don't go in the crevice.</p>
<p>I'm going in the crevice.</p>
<p>Come on, don't go in the crevice.</p>
<p>(groans)</p>
<p>Oh, come on, man.</p>
<p>(phone ringing)</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Yello.</p>
<p>Hey-o.</p>
<p>It's Mac.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>'Sup?!</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm going to go out and rage.</p>
<p>Is Charlie there?</p>
<p>Hey, it's Mac.</p>
<p>He wants to go rage.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I'm in the crevice.</p>
<p>He's in the crevice.</p>
<p>shit, he's in the crevice?</p>
<p>I'll come out with you.</p>
<p>We'll go out.</p>
<p>You and me, we'll go together.</p>
<p>We'll have a ball.</p>
<p>(line clicks, dial tone)</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>I-I'm not seeing how this relates to your weight gain.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm telling a story, Father.</p>
<p>Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.</p>
<p>I mean, you want to know all the key players and how success affected them, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think your time could be better spent if you focus more on yourself.</p>
<p>But I haven't done very much wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, Father?</p>
<p>I'm just going to plow ahead, because I'm sensing some resistance.</p>
<p>And Dennis always tells me, never let someone's resistance stop you from getting what you want.</p>
<p>So, the bar's success continued.</p>
<p>But Dee's inflated ego about her comedy was keeping her from doing her job.</p>
<p>Kids these days, they have so many more choices than we had when we were little.</p>
<p>Am I right?</p>
<p>Excuse me? Excuse me?</p>
<p>I mean, it's like, do you want to watch Kung Fu Panda</em> on Blu-ray... Excuse me?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah?</p>
<p>We are still waiting on those beers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>(scoffs)</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the joke.</p>
<p>And now where was I with it?</p>
<p>Can, um, we get those margaritas that we ordered a while ago, as well?</p>
<p>That'd be great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I finish the joke?</p>
<p>'Cause the funny part comes at the end, so you're going to miss it if you don't... Right.</p>
<p>No, you-you keep trying to tell jokes and...</p>
<p>Well, you keep interrupting me, and that's why I'm not...</p>
<p>Well, they're not really landing is what I'm trying to...</p>
<p>Oh, they're not landing because I'm not getting to the punch line, so if you could just be patient and let me get it out.</p>
<p>Kids these days have so many more choices...</p>
<p>No, don't, don't try to finish the joke.</p>
<p>Don't try to finish the joke.</p>
<p>I'm not even going to listen.</p>
<p>Oh, I just want my margarita, I just want my margarita, I just want my margarita.</p>
<p>You know what, you're not getting your margarita.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Why do we have this?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Dude, where the hell have you been?</p>
<p>Uh, slept in.</p>
<p>You slept in?</p>
<p>It's, like, almost the middle of the night, man.</p>
<p>Why were you sleeping in?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>Well, because I drank three bottles of champagne and hung out with a stray dog all night under a bridge, okay?</p>
<p>It was sweet.</p>
<p>Can I please get, like, 20 margaritas so this bitch will listen to my kid joke?</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, your jokes never land, all right?</p>
<p>So please don't concentrate on your comedy anymore, 'cause it's terrible, all right?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I said it.</p>
<p>Look, can we just do what we normally do?</p>
<p>I shouldn't even be bartending, all right?</p>
<p>I'm in over my head, I'm yelling at customers 'cause I'm getting a little agitated here.</p>
<p>Can Dennis please come here and do this?</p>
<p>Where is Dennis?</p>
<p>Dennis is in the bathroom, and he's been there for, like, an hour.</p>
<p>Okay, company meeting in the bathroom, okay, guys?</p>
<p>Company meeting.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Dennis?</p>
<p>Where are you, bud?</p>
<p>Company meeting.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm in here.</p>
<p>All right, good, man.</p>
<p>Hop on out. Company meeting.</p>
<p>I don't want to.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>It's a company meeting.</p>
<p>You have to... No.</p>
<p>What's going on in there?</p>
<p>I'm bashing it.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm bashing it.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Don't bash.</p>
<p>Don't bash.</p>
<p>I'll come out. I'll come out.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Uh, I saw a couple gray hairs, and I was, like, "I'll eradicate those," and then...</p>
<p>With black paint?</p>
<p>Well, just-just go easy on me, all right?</p>
<p>Don't make fun of me or anything.</p>
<p>I feel very sensitive right now.</p>
<p>It's hard to maintain all this.</p>
<p>You look like Superman.</p>
<p>Oh, cool. Yeah, right on.</p>
<p>Well, he was the original, right, so...?</p>
<p>The original what?</p>
<p>S-Superhero. He was, like... Ugh.</p>
<p>Is that what you're going for?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Dude, come on.</p>
<p>It would be that obvious, like, if you didn't know me.</p>
<p>You'd be, like, "Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Maybe that's Superman."</p>
<p>No, you wouldn't.</p>
<p>Everyone knows who Superman is, and they know it's not you.</p>
<p>shit. Right.</p>
<p>Guys, come on.</p>
<p>Clearly, success is starting to get to all of us.</p>
<p>We can't be Superman.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. No shit.</p>
<p>I'm running around like an animal out there.</p>
<p>I mean, all I'm doing is serving drinks.</p>
<p>You're supposed to serve drinks; You're a waitress.</p>
<p>People need their drinks, and we need a waitress to serve those drinks.</p>
<p>Guys, don't change now.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>We have a certain chemistry that got us here to begin with.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>We don't need to start...</p>
<p>Oh, that's terrible.</p>
<p>Let's just get back out there and step it up a little bit, please.</p>
<p>Let's just get back to work, man, and do what we do, okay?</p>
<p>You're not good.</p>
<p>"Back to work.</p>
<p>Back to work, everybody.</p>
<p>I'm Charlie, and I'm in charge all of a sudden."</p>
<p>Are you eating in there?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I got some donuts and some M&amp;Ms and some, uh, chips.</p>
<p>I could pass them through if you want some.</p>
<p>You aren't allowed to eat in here.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, Father.</p>
<p>I-I have enough.</p>
<p>If you want a donut, I could give you one.</p>
<p>You better put that away and come back when you're finished.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I... I'm done... done.</p>
<p>Uh, so Charlie was up all night working, and Frank was still coming up with plans, and they were not good.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>It's morning already, huh?</p>
<p>(yawning)</p>
<p>(yells)</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Hey, that's good.</p>
<p>You want to do that to people?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>It's a plan.</p>
<p>We'll do it to people.</p>
<p>We'll go around... Look at that.</p>
<p>Look at the look on your face.</p>
<p>That's so good.</p>
<p>Frank, I don't even think you know what a plan is, dude.</p>
<p>All right, I got something else I've been working on all night.</p>
<p>Come on, come with me.</p>
<p>Lock up, let's go, come with me.</p>
<p>Don't hit me with the stick again.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie?</p>

<p>All right, look at this now.</p>
<p>I put two extra stop signs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now there's four stop signs.</p>
<p>All right So no cars can go.</p>
<p>(Frank laughs)</p>
<p>Frank, you've just created a four-way intersection.</p>
<p>If anything, you've made this intersection safer.</p>
<p>No shit. Oh.</p>
<p>Look, dude, I don't have time for these shenanigans, all right?</p>
<p>I need sleep.</p>
<p>I'm a success now.</p>
<p>I'm trying so hard not to tip.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
<p>You need sleep?</p>
<p>Stop hitting me with the stick, dude, I swear to God...</p>
<p>This is the plan, this is the one we should have done.</p>
<p>Don't hit me with that anymore. Oh!</p>
<p>That was the one.</p>
<p>You little bitch.</p>
<p>And Charlie was, like, "I'm gonna jam that stick up your ass."</p>
<p>And then Frank was, like, "Come here, you little bitch, uh, God damn it."</p>
<p>Don't need to repeat all of the obscene language.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, Father.</p>
<p>I... I got lost in the moment because I'm a natural storyteller.</p>
<p>Oh... Anyway, I was being super prudent, and I was mapping out my successful lifestyle-- you know, champagne, sailing.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to sail.</p>
<p>I was really the only one who was handling the success with class, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>When Dee interrupted me with some lazy plan to get out of working.</p>
<p>Lazy's a sin, right?</p>
<p>Uh, you mean sloth?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Dee is guilty of sloth, and she's pro-abortion.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Okay, listen to this.</p>
<p>One sec.</p>
<p>Just picking out the places I want to avoid when I sail across the world.</p>
<p>No Africa for you, huh?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don't want to go to any poor places, you know.</p>
<p>Successful guy like myself, I'll have a target on my back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I guess... Okay. Well...</p>
<p>That's, uh... And, uh, too cold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ugh. Too violent.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's hot down there.</p>
<p>Too angry.</p>
<p>Oh, the whole thing?</p>
<p>You're just going to sail around the United States is what it looks like.</p>
<p>That's all you're... Uh, well, I probably want to avoid, like, this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don't blame you for that.</p>
<p>And I don't know what happens out here.</p>
<p>Okay, I tell you what.</p>
<p>Uh, while you were planning all of this, I came up with an amazing idea that's going to save everything for us.</p>
<p>You ready for this?</p>
<p>We get ourselves replacements.</p>
<p>That's not a very good idea.</p>
<p>Well, stay with me.</p>
<p>They're not just any replacements.</p>
<p>They'll be the total embodiment of us in looks and personality so that we maintain the same group chemistry and avoid tipping.</p>
<p>So they'll be like our avatars?</p>
<p>Sure, if that helps you.</p>
<p>Let's tell Dennis.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, Dennis, wake up.</p>
<p>I'm not sleeping.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Why are you hiding under the covers?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>(Sweet Dee gasps)</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>Do I look foolish?</p>
<p>Well, what in God's name have you done to your face?</p>
<p>I got a chemical peel.</p>
<p>You look like a monster, dude.</p>
<p>I was just trying to live up to all of your expectations of me.</p>
<p>What expectations?</p>
<p>Physical perfection.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Clearly, the success of the bar has proved that I have achieved physical perfection.</p>
<p>And now there's nowhere else for me to go but down from here.</p>
<p>So now I'm hanging on by a thread.</p>
<p>Why don't you lay off the skin treatments for a while?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, you don't think I should mess with my face anymore?</p>
<p>Well, right now it looks like you're wearing a mask of yourself over your face.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Not a good one, not a nice mask of myself?</p>
<p>Not a good one.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that a normal mask of me might look good?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>And if there was, would you guys wear it?</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>I'm very confused.</p>
<p>I'm going to be alone.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And without Dennis to shit all over Dee's ideas with me, I was lured into her very lazy, slothy, sinful avatar plan.</p>
<p>Mm, I got to say, I like what I'm seeing here.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me, uh... let me just fill you in on what we're doing here.</p>
<p>See, Mac and I run the hottest bar in Philadelphia, and we are looking for a couple of employees to fill our shoes, literally.</p>
<p>Mm. That said, there's a set of dumbbells to your feet there.</p>
<p>I'd like you to lift those and curl them, but don't do it in a normal way.</p>
<p>Now, this is for a bartending job, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is all part of it.</p>
<p>Now, get to work beefcake.</p>
<p>Okay. Guess I can fire off a couple reverse curls.</p>
<p>(Mac laughs)</p>
<p>He said fire off.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard him.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Look... look at that.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>He executed those perfectly.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>That was exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>I'd like to fast-track him, Dee.</p>
<p>He's perfect.</p>
<p>What? For you?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>What do...?</p>
<p>He looks nothing like you.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I mean, since we've been working, I've been neglecting my fitness regimen.</p>
<p>He understands... No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You never, ever once in your life have looked like that.</p>
<p>When I leave the gym, and I have a full pump... Yeah?</p>
<p>Dee was right though.</p>
<p>For me to use that gorgeous muscle monster as my avatar, I had to put on some serious bulk.</p>
<p>So did you go to the gym?</p>
<p>The gym?</p>
<p>Father, when Peter did the statue of David, he wasn't just hammering at pebbles.</p>
<p>First, he ordered the Jews to bring him a massive slab of marble.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let's wrap this up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, so Charlie was working his ass off.</p>
<p>Uh, but the customers were getting just as frustrated as he was.</p>
<p>Clearly, the pressures of success were cracking both he and Dennis.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>I got this guy.</p>
<p>I got my man right here.</p>
<p>You're the one who wanted the, uh, two Coors Lights and the gin and tonic.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I've been waiting half an hour for a Jack and Coke.</p>
<p>You've been waiting half an hour?</p>
<p>You've been waiting half an hour?</p>
<p>Well, with an attitude like that, you can wait another half an hour, buddy.</p>
<p>Hey, this drink tastes like bleach.</p>
<p>Because I'm dipping them in bleach so that I can clean them faster.</p>
<p>I don't have time to wash every single glass.</p>
<p>I dip it in bleach, then it's clean!</p>
<p>I'm not drinking bleach.</p>
<p>Then get out of my bar!</p>
<p>Get out of my bar!</p>
<p>I don't want to see you.</p>
<p>Is that your buddy?</p>
<p>You go with him.</p>
<p>No, I don't even know him.</p>
<p>You don't even know him.</p>
<p>Okay, well, become friends, and you walk home!</p>
<p>Get out!</p>
<p>(screams)</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>What's going on, man?</p>
<p>What's going on, dude, is that I'm completely overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I suck at bartending.</p>
<p>I'm going crazy.</p>
<p>Everyone's yelling at me.</p>
<p>They're getting all pissed off.</p>
<p>Why is your face shiny?</p>
<p>I had my skin peeled off wh chemicals.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Want to know why?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Well, it's just, uh, you know, I've created a level of success for myself that, uh, I just don't know if I can live up to it anymore, man.</p>
<p>My level of excellence is so high that I'm feeling the pressures, man.</p>
<p>Dude, I'm operating at such an excellent level.</p>
<p>It's insane.</p>
<p>You know, I'm running at of ten of excellence, and I'm used to being at whatever number.</p>
<p>I-I don't even want to be at a-- like, somewhere lower, but whatever.</p>
<p>The point is that I'm not going to let the bar down.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>He being on the tipping point is about working hard and caring about that work and really giving it your all.</p>
<p>Let's get high in the back office.</p>
<p>Let's get high and drop all this, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(techno music playing)</p>
<p>(sniffs)</p>
<p>(sniffs)</p>
<p>Deandra, you got to-- all you have to do is hold the pigeon, and I stick the M80 under its wing, I blow it up.</p>
<p>No, Frank.</p>
<p>I'm not going to help you detonate a pigeon.</p>
<p>That would be terrible publicity for a young comedienne.</p>
<p>Well, you-you don't have to do anything.</p>
<p>I just-- we stick the pigeon in there, we run, the flock blows up, we got a lot of tasty meat.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>We have a pigeon feast.</p>
<p>Shut up. What's going on?</p>
<p>Where is everyone?</p>
<p>I have all kinds of new bits and no audience.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Maybe we tipped too soon.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>I was just starting to get a taste of success.</p>
<p>I need more.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Music.</p>
<p>Coming from in the back.</p>
<p>Back here?</p>
<p>(music continues)</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Hey! What the hell are you ck bags doing back here?</p>
<p>The bar is completely empty.</p>
<p>I'm watching Charlie do his thing, and it's good, man.</p>
<p>It's, like, good.</p>
<p>It looks like we did tip, Deandra.</p>
<p>We might as well sin and get high.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm a sinner, too, right?</p>
<p>Oh, ho, ho.</p>
<p>(sniffing in)</p>
<p>Oh, Mac's the best.</p>
<p>Oh, I love him.</p>
<p>Isn't he?</p>
<p>Also, I'm pro-abortion, so I'm probably going straight to hell.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, and I got fat.</p>
<p>I'm much fatter than Mac.</p>
<p>You're so fat, and, uh...</p>
<p>♪ Oh, big, fat, big, fat Big, fat titties Big, fat ass. ♪</p>
<p>(Frank scat sings)</p>
<p>You got big, fat titties.</p>
<p>♪ Mm-hmm, over here... ♪</p>
<p>And I like to kill babies, unborn babies.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure how that conversation went, but I imagine it was along those lines.</p>
<p>The point is, six weeks later, they dropped a bomb on me.</p>
<p>(explosion)</p>
<p>We're not idiots.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm going to take the precaution of boiling the blood before I use it.</p>
<p>Yeah, now, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It does not matter if you boil it, Charlie.</p>
<p>You can't... you can't replace Frank's blood with bags of blood that you found behind a hospital.</p>
<p>But... wait, wait.</p>
<p>It just won't work.</p>
<p>Dennis, he's not going to replace my blood.</p>
<p>He's going to add to it to make me more virile.</p>
<p>I'm just pumping more in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you're just going to be bursting at the seams with blood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey-o. What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I'm 200 pounds.</p>
<p>I'm as big as my avatar.</p>
<p>What's an avatar?</p>
<p>You know the avatar that we're going to get to do all of our work for us, so I can go sailing, and-and Dee can tell her stupid jokes, and Dennis can pour more acid on his face.</p>
<p>Are we still doing that?</p>
<p>No. We-We gave that plan up a really long time ago.</p>
<p>Is that why you've been stuffing your face for six weeks?</p>
<p>Yeah. I've been trying to get as big as my avatar, so we don't tip.</p>
<p>Dude, that was, like, a million plans ago.</p>
<p>All of us, including you-- we've been engaged in many other plans and schemes since then.</p>
<p>Wh-Where have you been?</p>
<p>You guys dropped the tipping plan?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought we were just putting it on the back burner until I hit two hundo.</p>
<p>Why do you think we've been calling you fat this entire time?</p>
<p>Wh... Why wouldn't somebody tell me that we dropped the plan?</p>
<p>Stop chewing on food and start thinking about what's going on in the bar, and then you...</p>
<p>(overlapping chatter)</p>
<p>Don't-Don't make fun of me, okay?</p>
<p>I'm-I'm busting my ass out there trying to do the avatar plan, and-and now you guys are laughing at me.</p>
<p>But you have candy coming out of your pocket.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>I was hungry.</p>
<p>I was hungry.</p>
<p>Don't laugh at me.</p>
<p>Don't laugh at me!</p>
<p>(mocking): Don't laugh at me.</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>Is he trying to rip his shirt off?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You guys are going to hell, okay?</p>
<p>(laughter)</p>
<p>You guys are going to hell.</p>
<p>Don't laugh at me.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>"Don't laugh at me."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>So, now you understand.</p>
<p>I understand none of it.</p>
<p>Father, my friends totally boned me.</p>
<p>They became successful, egotistical monsters.</p>
<p>They forced me into this avatar thing, and now they're totally ditching the plan.</p>
<p>But it's all about the avatar.</p>
<p>The beefcake avatar.</p>
<p>But you weren't going to understand that unless I told you the whole story.</p>
<p>I'm going to be perfectly honest.</p>
<p>I still don't know what you want me to do.</p>
<p>Okay, um, let me start at the beginning, because clearly, you didn't understand it.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no ,hat won't be necessary.</p>
<p>Uh, if, uh... if I smite your friends and absolve you, will you leave?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You're absolved, and your friends are smited.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, please leave.</p>
<p>(laughing): Okay, great.</p>
<p>Oh, um, when should I see the results?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Well, when does the spell kick in?</p>
<p>Wh-When is God going to shed some of this weight for me?</p>
<p>Six weeks.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Not hard. Perfect.</p>
<p>Uh, glory unto you, ghost man in the sky, that created us all and pre-determines everything.</p>
<p>I'll see you in six weeks.</p>
<p>(priest groans)</p>
