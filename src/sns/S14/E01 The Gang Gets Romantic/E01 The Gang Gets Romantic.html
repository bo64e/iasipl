<p>Wha... what?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah. It's a good ad.</p>
<p>You know, we got the Airbnb idea from Dennis and Mac, 'cause they're doing it.</p>
<p>Yes, but we're not posting creepy flyers at bus stations. I mean, w-what kind of people do you think you're gonna attract with that?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p>Young Bohemians with no sexual boundaries, w-who don't mind a shitter down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, like, European backpacking chicks who stay in hostels and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. Free.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Don't be jealous when Charlie and I are up to our eyebrows in Viennese gash.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Ugh, gross.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Guys, don't try to lump yourselves in with what we're doing, okay? What we're doing is very charming and romantic.</p>
<p>We're setting up a meet-cute.</p>
<p>Ah, a-a w-what?</p>
<p>Are you trying to say, uh, "meat cube"?</p>
<p>Like, a little cube of meat?</p>
<p>Meat?</p>
<p>Because that's a good idea, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: No. ( <em>stammers</em> )</p>
<p>We're doing a meet-cute.</p>
<p>It's-it's where two soul mates meet under charming and/or cute circumstances.</p>
<p>Like, from a rom-com.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No.</p>
<p>Let-let's keep the trap simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>We can work this out, because I think we can probably stay in the same room to-together.</p>
<p>It wouldn't bother me if it wouldn't bother you.</p>
<p>I mean, I-I don't like to come off as a difficult person.</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Oh. Now, d-do you like to come off as a difficult person?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs softly</em> ) No.</p>
<p>No. Of course not.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Who-who would? Who would?</p>
<p>Yeah. No, no one likes to be a difficult person, so we can make it work.</p>
<p>I'm Dennis.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ): Uh...</p>
<p>I don't think my husband and I would be comfortable sharing a room.</p>

<p>Yeah, somehow I do.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>

<p>Absolutely. Yeah, you guys, you guys hit the hay.</p>
<p>We're probably gonna hit the hay, too.</p>

<p>All right, yeah. Best of luck.</p>

<p>Australia? Or what is that...?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>

<p>Alexi and Nikki.</p>
<p>Oh, wowee, Frank.</p>
<p>Those names are, those names are like...</p>
<p>Before they get here, we got to lay down some ground rules.</p>
<p>When we wind up working the same broad, no eye contact between the two of us.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>And they're gonna encourage us to explore each other's bodies.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>A-And that's a hard no for me.</p>
<p>No, for me, too.</p>
<p>Let's lead with that.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I want...</p>

<p>Uh... Hey, can...</p>
<p>I just kind of want you to explain what you...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...what you got on your mind here, but...</p>
<p>Who the hell are you?</p>
<p>Hi. We're here for the room.</p>
<p>Nah, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We're waiting for Nikki and Alexi.</p>
<p>Yeah. I am Nikki, and this is my father Alexi.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>( <em>grunts</em> ) What is this, man?</p>
<p>W-What, what are we doing?</p>
<p>I-I don't want to do this anymore. Can we stop?</p>
<p>Huh? No, we can't stop now.</p>
<p>We're-we're right on track.</p>
<p>I don't know, man. It just...</p>
<p>It just feels like a-a lot of effort, and it feels desperate, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, I-I never put this much work into banging some cute meat.</p>
<p>Cute meat?</p>
<p>Cute meat. That-that was your phrase.</p>
<p>No, Dennis, "meet-cute."</p>
<p>It has a name, Mac. Its name is Lisa.</p>
<p>This is fun, right? This is the banter. This is the, this is... this is all a part of act one banter.</p>
<p>And we are right on schedule.</p>
<p>Shh. Listen.</p>
<p>( <em>distant arguing</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>whispering</em> ): They're fighting.</p>

<p>( <em>distant squawking</em> )</p>
<p>What's that third noise?</p>
<p>Dude, i-is that, like, a chicken or a parrot or some shit? Dude, uh, I thought we said no animals.</p>
<p>Mac, tell them no animals in my room.</p>
<p>That's no animal.</p>
<p>( <em>knocking on door</em> )</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>We needed reinforcements.</p>
<p>Okay, catch me up to speed.</p>
<p>Shh, shh.</p>
<p>Listen, listen. ( <em>mouths</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: You can't keep blaming me for what happened with Teddy.</p>
<p>Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.</p>
<p>Who is Teddy? ( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Mm...</p>
<p>The wife must have cheated on the husband with some guy named Teddy.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that's all wrong.</p>
<p>The female love interest can't be a cheater, because that makes her unlikable.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn't a romantic comedy about the wife at all.</p>
<p>Maybe it's about the husband.</p>
<p>Yes. The husband is the lonely heart who needs to find love in the big city. ( <em>gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Dee, you're my new romantic lead, proving that romantic leads don't have to be likable at all.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't follow any of this.</p>
<p>Am I in or out?</p>
<p>You're out.</p>
<p>Great. I'm gonna go sleep in the living room.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>( <em>polka song playing, yodeling</em> )</p>
<p>Charlie, this is weird as shit.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey... hey, uh, Nikki, what's this that we're listening to here, pal?</p>
<p><strong>Nikki</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>It's just a little bit of music that I wrote.</p>
<p>Ah, you're a, you're a yodeler, huh?</p>
<p>( <em>music stops</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, y-yeah. Uh, may I ask if you have a small pot that I can boil these lederhosen in?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>I got something. Uh, let me just look around here.</p>
<p>( <em>Nikki humming</em> )</p>
<p>What do you got going there with the toe?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Does he speak English?</p>
<p>No, and sadly, he refuses to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Frank doesn't like to learn new things either.</p>
<p>Here you go. Tha-That should work.</p>
<p>Ask him what he's working that toe with.</p>
<p>( <em>speaking German</em> )</p>
<p>Um, how do you say... There is no word.</p>
<p>Uh, "toe spoon," for the digging out of the toe.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Don't flick it.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, can I talk to you for a second over here, man?</p>
<p>Mind if we just...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dude, this is weird as hell man.</p>
<p>We gotta... We're just gonna have to, like, power through this night, and then we'll figure something out tomorrow, man.</p>
<p>All right? We'll just... Let's just get into bed, and get out of here. Hey, hey, guys, you know, we figure we should just turn in early.</p>
<p>We're gonna go to sleep right now.</p>
<p>'Cause the night goes quicker, you know?</p>
<p>We usually sleep ass to ass.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>But let's see if we can...</p>
<p>I call the side.</p>
<p>I'll get...</p>
<p>You got the end, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Picked the side here.</p>
<p>Why don't you hop in.</p>
<p>All right, I'll hop in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, ass to ass.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We're ass to ass.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>( <em>snorts</em> )</p>
<p>fuck this.</p>
<p>( <em>whispering</em> ): Dennis. Come here.</p>
<p>What... What are you doing, man?</p>
<p>Shh! Shh.</p>
<p>Wh-Why are you in their room?</p>
<p>Shh, shh, shh.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I just set up the perfect meet-cute for Dee.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>See, Greg's in the shower, so I snuck in there, I picked the lock, and I just made my way in.</p>
<p>I checked him out for a quick second.</p>
<p>He has a tiny penis, just for the record.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Then, I open up the toilet.</p>
<p>I shit, like, my brains out into it, right?</p>
<p>I came at this thing like an animal, man.</p>
<p>And then I took a bunch of toilet paper.</p>
<p>I-I jammed it in there so it won't flush; it won't flush.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because when Greg gets out of the shower, he's gonna realize that this toilet is a mess.</p>
<p>I mean, it is a splatter-fest.</p>
<p>He's gonna look for a plunger. There is no plunger.</p>
<p>I'm gonna send him down to the hardware store, where he's gonna run into Dee.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Greg, y... Are you okay in there?</p>
<p>Um, no. I-I think there's a problem with the toilet.</p>
<p>You may need to get a plunger.</p>
<p>A plunger? Oh, man, we don't really even have a plunger here in the apartment, but we have a hardware store down the street.</p>
<p>If you go down there and get it, I can get you back.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. Hey, when did this happen?</p>
<p>Wh-What?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The shit in the toilet. It's not mine.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, when did that happen?</p>
<p>Just close the door.</p>
<p>That's what I'm asking you.</p>
<p>Okay, now the plan is in motion for you.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>What do you mean the plan's in motion for me?</p>
<p>I thought I was out.</p>
<p>Remember when we were saying that the female romantic lead would never cheat?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I overheard Lisa saying to Greg that she misses Teddy.</p>
<p>Huh? Why would she tell Greg that she misses the guy that she cheated with?</p>
<p>Unless she didn't cheat on him with Teddy.</p>
<p>Maybe Teddy was a platonic friend from high school that makes Greg jealous.</p>
<p>Don't you know what this means?</p>
<p>Lisa is still our romantic lead, which means...</p>
<p>So I'm still your leading man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs heavily</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>frying pan sizzling</em> )</p>
<p>This is crazy, Charlie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I mean, Dennis is having meet cubes with hot chicks, and we're stuck with these guys.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I want to be having meet cubes, right?</p>
<p>Me, too. Me, too.</p>
<p>( <em>exclaiming in German</em> )</p>
<p>What the hell? What the hell is he doing?</p>
<p>I don't know what he's doing.</p>
<p>What are you... What are you doing there?</p>
<p>What... What are you doing with the spoon?</p>
<p>You can't get to the hard-to-reach places with that.</p>
<p>You need a knife. You need an edge.</p>
<p>Here, take this.</p>
<p>What, uh...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What are you working on over here, pal?</p>
<p>Because, you know, Frank and I have a very specific diet; we like to eat pretty clean.</p>
<p>And I don't want to...</p>
<p>That is, uh, sausage...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>...mit peanut butter und apricot jam sandwich.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>But the trick is to melt the cheese on the outside.</p>
<p>Well, that's right, you put peanut butter on the inside, you put the cheese on the outside.</p>
<p>But you don't want to burn that cheese, right, so you...</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: ...so you finish it on the radiator.</p>
<p>I do that, too. I didn't think anyone did that, man!</p>
<p>And that is the trick. That's how you do it.</p>
<p>That's exactly... Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Hey, Charlie, this is pretty good.</p>
<p>You can get in there behind the toe, and it's rounded, so you don't have a chance of<em> filletin'</em> yourself.</p>
<p>Probably shouldn't share it, though, guys.</p>
<p>It's not... That's not sanitary.</p>
<p>I got a question. Tell me if it's asking too much, but I've always kind of seen myself as a yodeler.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to show me how you do that?</p>
<p>I would like that very much.</p>
<p>For real? Okay, 'cause I feel like...</p>
<p>( <em>phone chimes</em> )</p>

<p>He bangs that nasty snatch, and then Lisa recognizes that he is a dullard and needs to drop him, so that Lisa, the true hero of the story, can figure out that she needs to be free and find love.</p>

<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We got the backpackers we wanted, and they're as sexually free as we hoped.</p>
<p>Those girls are wild, man.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>They wanted us to, like-like, touch each other and stuff.</p>
<p>I'm like, "Dude, that's a hard no for me."</p>
<p>No, it was a hard no for me, too.</p>
<p>Well, but...</p>

<p>No, no, no, I wasn't...</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie and Frank chattering excitedly</em> )</p>
<p>I can't even understand them half the time.</p>
<p>It's like the accents...</p>
<p>I don't know. They were crazy chicks.</p>
<p>Hey, hoping you're having fun with your "meat cube" romance party. That does sound fun.</p>
<p>I do want some of those meat cubes later.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p>I know that it's crazy 'cause we just met, but I feel like if-if you just give us a chance, we could tell a love story for the ages. ( <em>chuckles softly</em> )</p>
<p>A gay... gay-ass love story.</p>
<p>A-And, yeah, maybe it won't play in Middle America, and-and maybe it's not even ready for the mainstream, but it'll win a ton of awards, and it'll get a shit ton of attention for the liberal press.</p>
