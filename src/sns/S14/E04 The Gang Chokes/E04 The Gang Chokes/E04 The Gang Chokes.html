<p>( <em>Glass clinking</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, guys, I-I'd like to raise a glass to Frank.</p>
<p>Frank, another year has gone by since you came into my life.</p>
<p>I don't see any blue on this menu.</p>
<p>Well, hang on. Don't interrupt.</p>
<p>Why do you want to eat blue?</p>
<p>The best foods are blue.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Charlie, let's just order, shall we?</p>
<p>Now, Dennis, what will I be having this evening?</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to just order, okay?</p>
<p>I'm trying to say some nice words here, okay?</p>
<p>About what?</p>
<p>About you, man.</p>
<p>Oh, God. You people.</p>
<p>Ugh, this guy again.</p>
<p>Come on, man. What are you doing here? This isn't Guigino's.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought you moved.</p>
<p>I moved back. So... Wait, you guys remember me?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, you're everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah. We can't get away from you.</p>
<p>You know what? Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>What's in them little bowls? Blue, I hope.</p>
<p>I... Bl...</p>
<p>No, i-it's amuse-bouche for the table.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>We didn't order yet, pal.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Again, Dennis, what am I having?</p>
<p>Stop asking me that.</p>
<p>I'm not paying for those, pal.</p>
<p>They're compliments from the chef.</p>
<p>We don't want compliments, we want food.</p>
<p>If I wanted a compliment, I'd walk into a bar. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, Dee. God.</p>
<p>Dee, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah, Dennis, do you want me to throw my glass of water in her face?</p>
<p>Well, don't ask. Just do.</p>
<p>Well, h-hang on a second, dude. You don't chew no good anymore.</p>
<p>You want me to chew that up for you?</p>
<p>I don't want that.</p>
<p>Well, you haven't had your teeth sharpened in a bit.</p>
<p>I better chew it.</p>
<p>He gets his teeth sharpened?</p>
<p>Not as often as he should. No. Uh...</p>
<p>( <em>Frank choking</em> )</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>I think he's choking.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, he can't get air.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>Choking continues</em> )</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, folks, we have a few specials tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>( <em>Grunting</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Gasping</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Low growl</em> )</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: That's it! Yeah, I'm absolutely having a fit!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All night long?</p>
<p>Look, I-I'm sorry, okay?</p>
<p>I'm having a fit. That's right.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened. I froze up, all right?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. You froze up.</p>
<p>May-Maybe I thought that's how you wanted to go out, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That's how I wanted to go? Me?</p>
<p>I don't know! I don't know how you want to die.</p>
<p>You only ever talk about how you don't want to die, like in a hospital bed or getting spit-roasted by two Latin King gang members in prison.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, look, at least here, you're in a fancy restaurant, right?</p>
<p>You're surrounded by your friends.</p>
<p>Oh, my friends.</p>
<p>Who are watching me choke to death with pleasure in their eyes.</p>
<p>Nobody had pleasure! Okay, maybe I was a little mad at you, all right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Y-You didn't let me finish my speech.</p>
<p>You kept interrupting me about anything that's blue on the menu, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn't let me chew your food for you. You know, you...</p>
<p>Oh, well, you're not gonna be able to do that, either.</p>
<p>No more chewing my food.</p>
<p>You mash it too thin.</p>
<p>You take all the flavor out of it.</p>
<p>( <em>Sputters</em> )</p>
<p>You get all the nutrients. I get all the mush.</p>
<p>You...</p>
<p>Do you think I want to chew your food?</p>
<p>Yeah, you...</p>
<p>Well, you don't have to do that anymore, because I'm going.</p>
<p>Where are you gonna go?</p>
<p>I'm going to the one person who actually cares about me.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Good. You know what, fine, go.</p>
<p>Get out of here. I don't care.</p>
<p>I'll go back to being me. You know, young and cool before I started chewing the food of some crazy old man.</p>
<p>You know, I used to do cool shit, Frank!</p>
<p>I used to be cool!</p>
<p>I'm cool.</p>
<p>( <em>Slurps</em> )</p>
<p>That was an interesting evening.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, it was. Frank was pissed.</p>
<p>I would've stepped in, but, of course, I was taking my cues from you.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, you didn't tell me whether I should save him or not.</p>
<p>But why? I mean, wh... why do I still have to tell you what to do?</p>
<p>Why do I still have to order your dinners for you?</p>
<p>And why is it up to me to decide whether or not you're going to save a man's life?</p>
<p>You know what the problem is?</p>
<p>I can't depend on you. I can't depend on anyone.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, if that had been me choking tonight... no one would've saved me.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I-I would've saved you, Dennis. I would have saved you.</p>
<p>( <em>Scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>If you told me to.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ... if I told you to?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>♪ Pizza man, pizza man ♪<br />
♪ I got pizza here, who wants pizza man? ♪</p>
<p>What are you doing here, man? It's, like, after midnight.</p>
<p>Uh, after midnight? What are you, like, in your 40s?</p>
<p>Yeah. As are you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have a slice. Let's get into it, boys.</p>
<p>No! No.</p>
<p>Dennis cannot eat cheese, because cheese is poison.</p>
<p>No dairy for this guy.</p>
<p>That's actually correct.</p>
<p>Oh. It's all good, though. I actually ate all the cheese on the walk over, so... no cheese!</p>
<p>Oh! That solves it. Dennis will have the crust and the sauce, then.</p>
<p>No, Mac.</p>
<p>Not gonna have the crust. Are you insane?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, carbs aside, it's absolutely teeming with gluten.</p>
<p>I knew that. I just... I forgot.</p>
<p>You didn't know that.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Don't worry about that, though. It's all good.</p>
<p>I ate the crust, too.</p>
<p>Oh, so you came over with a box of tomato sauce?</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Dennis will have the sauce.</p>
<p>Sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Actually, I slurped that up, too, because that was just kind of looking good, so I figured...</p>
<p>So you ate them all separately... all the elements... and then came over with an empty pizza box?</p>
<p>This is a nice gesture, you know.</p>
<p>It's not.</p>
<p>It's the suggestion of food.</p>
<p>Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groans</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You are not going to believe what just happened to me. Okay.</p>
<p>Christ. She's here now.</p>
<p>So, I'm wandering around, right, for hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I-I'm just thinking about what happened tonight and... with Frank, you know... and-and I'm not proud of it, but I, uh...</p>
<p>Something weird kind of happened to me with that whole thing, 'cause I... I got a pretty good rush from a man almost dying right in front of me.</p>
<p>I-I liked it, and-and, you know, I'm thinking about it so much that I sort of space out.</p>
<p>Long story short, I wind up in the middle of the street, okay?</p>
<p>And an Uber just goes flying by me at, like-like, 50. Almost hit me!</p>
<p>You're so good at telling stories. So concise.</p>
<p>I wish it did hit you.</p>
<p>You guys, the rush I got from that...</p>
<p>You would not believe it.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, I-I...</p>
<p>I don't believe it. I don't care about it.</p>
<p>I don't care. I don't care.</p>
<p>It blew my mind.</p>
<p>Why'd you come over?</p>
<p>No, wait, I-I can't stand this.</p>
<p>I-I can't do this. I mean, it's in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p>Okay? And I'm surrounded by lunatics here.</p>
<p>We are surrounded by lunatics.</p>
<p>You're one of the lunatics!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? This is the one thing I've learned tonight.</p>
<p>I can't depend on anyone but myself, okay?</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>So I got to take care of myself. I got to stay healthy.</p>
<p>You know what? I'm gonna go to bed.</p>
<p>That's what I should... I'm gonna go to bed.</p>
<p>Go to bed? What are you, 40?</p>
<p>We're the same age!</p>
<p>Uh, Dennis, should I go to bed, too?</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I don't care!</p>
<p>He said yes, I think?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't think he gives a shit what you do.</p>
<p>I don't think he cares.</p>
<p>He cares because we depend on each other, so I should probably go to sleep because we depend on each other.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I got to wake up and depend on him.</p>
<p>He's gonna depend on me, so good night, guys.</p>
<p>Okay, so, what do you want to get into?</p>
<p>Oh, I kind of wanted to hang out with the guys, so...</p>
<p>I know. I know. Me, too.</p>
<p>But they went to bed, so just you and me.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I-I don't want it to be.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey-o! Look who's up. Sleepyhead.</p>
<p>Here you go. You know you grind your teeth at night?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing in my home?</p>
<p>I'm moving in.</p>
<p>Hey, you had my back. Now I'm gonna have yours.</p>
<p>Uh, first thing we got to do is beef up the security around here.</p>
<p>You know how easy it was for me to get in that window?</p>
<p>Took me all of 30 seconds with this hammer.</p>
<p>I could have been bashing your face in before you knew what hit you, which would've been this hammer, which I already had in my hand, in case you weren't listening.</p>
<p>Wh-What's going on?</p>
<p>It's you and me against the world, kid.</p>
<p>You got a nice place here.</p>
<p>Wouldn't be bad to have a roommate.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I only saved you because it's what any decent person would do, but I don't need a roommate.</p>
<p>I already live here with my mother.</p>
<p>Oh. That old vegetable lady is your mom?</p>
<p>Nah, you don't have to worry about her.</p>
<p>I took care of her.</p>
<p>Took care of her? What do you mean?</p>
<p>I threw a sheet over her head. She was freaking me out.</p>
<p>Mom! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Are you all right?</p>
<p>I don't think she can hear you, pal. She's gonzo.</p>
<p>Why would you want to live with that when you can live with me and get a lot of good action?</p>
<p>Please leave before I call the police.</p>
<p>Suit yourself.</p>
<p>Door or window?</p>
<p>The door is fine.</p>
<p>It's gonna take me a long time to bash through that door.</p>
<p>Guys, how long is this gonna take?</p>
<p>Dennis needs to finish his pre-workout shake, Charlie.</p>
<p>And I rubbed down his calves, and now I have to tape his ankles.</p>
<p>Yeah, but can we just, like, play already?</p>
<p>No, we can't just play, Charlie. We can't just play.</p>
<p>Are you insane?! We can't just play!</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, what's he...? What?</p>
<p>Look, honestly, Dennis shouldn't even be playing basketball in the first place...</p>
<p>Wrong, Mac.</p>
<p>Basketball is exactly what I should be doing.</p>
<p>It's what men like Frank never did, and their bodies became soft and feeble and-and round and at high risk for injury and disease and choking on things.</p>
<p>Well, can we do something?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let's just... let's begin with a light warm-up of, uh...</p>
<p>( <em>Clears throat</em> ) passing, and then after 15 minutes or so of that, we'll work our way into a light jog, and then we'll do some layups.</p>
<p>Passing. All right.</p>
<p>Too hard. Too fast.</p>
<p>Still a little bit too hard.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ah, damn it.</p>
<p>Jesus, man. What-what the hell was that? Are you okay?</p>
<p>Ow. I don't know. My... timing's a little bit off.</p>
<p>I... might not be feeling too well all of a sudden.</p>
<p>( <em>Gasps</em> ) Wait a second.</p>
<p>Dennis, I-I feel like there's a little bit of pollen in the air.</p>
<p>Pollen?!</p>
<p>You didn't tell me there was to be pollen today.</p>
<p>I-I can't do pollen. I don't do pollen.</p>
<p>I know. I didn't know. I mean, maybe, on account of the season, I thought maybe...</p>
<p>Oh. Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>Panting</em> ): I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Come on, Dee. Why are you here?</p>
<p>Hear me out, you guys.</p>
<p>This whole thing with Frank and the Uber stuff... it's got me thinking, you know.</p>
<p>I feel like the only way to truly live life to its fullest is to live it on the edge.</p>
<p>On the edge of what?</p>
<p>On the edge of life or death.</p>
<p>So, I went into the Puerto Rican part of town, started making fun of their big fat asses and asked them if they were Dominican.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why-why would you do that?</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, I did start with some stuff that was slightly less offensive, but turns out, they're a very lovely community, so I really had to...</p>
<p>I had to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Really, really hit 'em where it hurt.</p>
<p>Anyway, they're on their way.</p>
<p>They're on their way?!</p>
<p>Yeah, after what I said, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, "Um, you guys, why don't you take a break from your cockfighting and, uh, you know, hop in your rafts and come bring it to a real American?"</p>
<p>And then I was like, "Follow me."</p>
<p>( <em>Singing "Mexican Hat Dance"</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: That's Mexican!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: That's Mexican.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh! That did it.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this?</p>
<p>It pissed 'em off.</p>
<p>Because it-it gave me a r... a-a thrill like you wouldn't believe.</p>
<p>Anyway, you guys want in on this with me?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>You-you would put us all at risk with your suicidal race-baiting. I... I-I...</p>
<p>Eh, something's off. I-I got to go home.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis. Dennis, yes.</p>
<p>I got to go home.</p>
<p>You're leaving?</p>
<p>You know what? He-he needs his post-workout shake.</p>
<p>You haven't worked out yet.</p>
<p>That's what it is. I need a...</p>
<p>Yes, we were playing basketball, and I've depleted my electrolytes, and now I'm Dee-shaming, and that's depleted me even more, so, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Uh, let me... let me get you home, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'm wobbly.</p>
<p>Here. You can count on me, buddy.</p>
<p>All right, get me...</p>
<p>You can count on me.</p>
<p>Get me home.</p>
<p>He can count on me, guys.</p>
<p>The hell's wrong with him?</p>
<p>Uh, pollen, I guess.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>So, uh, you want to take this beating with me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Waiter</strong>: Hey, Mom.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>Had to work a double shift.</p>
<p>Hey-o! All good.</p>
<p>Made her dinner already. She's eating blue.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Well, I figure, you were at work, and your mom was stuck home alone, so I broke in again.</p>
<p>What did you do to her?</p>
<p>What? Well, I just spruced her up a little bit.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think she look nuts!</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? Stop coming here.</p>
<p>I don't want you here. Stop breaking into my home, okay?</p>
<p>Whoa. Why are you being such a hard-on about this?</p>
<p>I'm just trying to help a little bit.</p>
<p>You know, I did a little homework while you were away.</p>
<p>You graduated at the top of your class with honors, and were enrolled in pilot school.</p>
<p>But then, your mommy got sick, and you had to take other jobs and make ends meet.</p>
<p>I mean, it must've been really hard being up there, slinging V8 Juice when you should've been captain of the ship.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Somebody enrolled somebody back into pilot school.</p>
<p>So, what do you say we quit that dead-end job you're in and put your mommy in a real nice home?</p>
<p>Something with 24-hour care, on me.</p>
<p>And not one of them bang 'em and bin 'em joints.</p>
<p>Something really nice.</p>
<p>Would be nice to go back to pilot school. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, let me give you some more.</p>
<p>Yeah. Here you go. Here you go.</p>
<p>Yeah. Blue has the most antioxygens.</p>
<p>( <em>Shudders</em> ): Ugh.</p>
<p>Christ. I feel like I'm dying.</p>
<p>Just let me help you, Dennis.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Here, have another health shake.</p>
<p>No. I don't want another one of your stupid shakes, Mac.</p>
<p>All right? And for the last time, please just leave me alone.</p>
<p>Just...</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I want to throw this shake in your stupid face, but I'm struggling.</p>
<p>Charlie, will you please throw this shake in Mac's face for me?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Dennis, do you want me to throw it into my own face?</p>
<p>That would ruin the effect.</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Right. Charlie, throw this in my face.</p>
<p>Well, don't tell him to throw it in your face, because now I feel like you want it.</p>
<p>Uh, what if I throw it in my face?</p>
<p>I don't want it.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: No, you're not following.</p>
<p>He wants you to throw that in my face, and he wants me to not want it.</p>
<p>I don't want it, right, Dennis?</p>
<p>You've both ruined the moment.</p>
<p>You've misunderstood what I'm going for, and I'm just gonna go lie down on my bed. I feel so awful.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll carry you, because I...</p>
<p>No, no, no. You're not gonna...</p>
<p>No. You dropped me twice last time.</p>
<p>You bumbling idiot. You're probably also covered in pollen, which is making me feel horrible.</p>
<p>A pollen-covered man offering to carry a-a perfectly well man.</p>
<p>It's insane.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, can I have your...?</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>( <em>Door closes</em> )</p>
<p>You mind if I have his shake, then, if he's not gonna have it?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Can I have this?</p>
<p>No, that's, uh...</p>
<p>That's his shake, so... you can't have it. Just...</p>
<p>Yeah, but... I-I want it, and he said he didn't want it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but he might want it later, so...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but I kind of want it now, so I'd like to have the shake, then.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's not really for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I want it, and he's not having it, so I don't really see any reason why...</p>
<p>You can't have it, Charlie!</p>
<p>Yeah! I will drink it!</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>It's a... protein shake.</p>
<p>It's just a health shake for Dennis.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it tastes like pizza.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Nah, it's...</p>
<p>You know what? There's a lot of different flavors.</p>
<p>That's probably, like, the pizza-flavored one.</p>
<p>And soda.</p>
<p>Wha... Are you feeding Dennis blended-up pizza and soda shakes?</p>
<p>Shh. Yes. Uh, I...</p>
<p>Why? Why are you doing that?</p>
<p>Because I'm...</p>
<p>I'm poisoning him, all right? Just...</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Look, uh, all the gluten and the sugar and the dairy, uh, just wreaks havoc on his system, you know?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And it makes him so weak.</p>
<p>And then he's gonna depend on me to take care of him, to bring him back from the brink of death.</p>
<p>Why are you doing that?</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p>Well, because I want him to depend on me, Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>( <em>Clattering nearby</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Nah! That's gonna take way too long.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p>Dee, did you just scale up the side of the building?</p>
<p>( <em>Strained</em> ): Yeah.</p>
<p>Free soloed it.</p>
<p>Sucked though. Didn't feel a thing.</p>
<p>Look, Mac, Munchausen by proxy, that's cute and everything.</p>
<p>But if you want Dennis to really depend on you, you're gonna have to save his life... for real.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna help you.</p>
<p>Aw...</p>
<p>Don't. Just don't.</p>

<p>Hey! You're just in time for a blue feast.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Did you have a good sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah. To be honest, I had the best night's sleep of my life.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel kind of guilty saying this, but, uh, since you found a home for my mom, I feel like this-this huge weight has been lifted off of me.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Great! Let's eat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come on. Okay. All right.</p>
<p>Okay. Great.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know if I want to eat that.</p>

<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) All right. Well, how 'bout if you just make a speech?</p>
<p>A what?</p>
<p>A speech. You know, something to honor our new relationship.</p>
<p>Uh, do I have to?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, uh... this is exciting.</p>
<p>Good start.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm excited to get back in the simulator, log some more hours.</p>
<p>Oh, good, good.</p>
<p>Well, but don't just make the speech about you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Put me in there a little bit, too.</p>
<p>Oh. Okay. Uh... ( <em>Inhales</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, thanks for sticking my mom in that home. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Never could've done it myself.</p>
<p>Yeah. Mm, mm.</p>
<p>She always said it's the last thing she ever wanted, so...</p>
<p>So, thank you.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Wait, your mom said that's the last thing she wanted, was to be in a home?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>She said it all the time.</p>
<p>So, when you saw her in there, why'd you let her stay?</p>
<p>Well, I didn't see her. You took her.</p>
<p>You mean you didn't have the decency to go?</p>
<p>You told me not to, to avoid the emotion of it all.</p>
<p>Well, I told you not to because I was sticking her in a bang 'em and bin 'em joint.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>They're much cheaper!</p>
<p>I'm starting to think I had you pegged all wrong.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, can we go back to the "bang 'em and bin 'em" thing?</p>
<p>To think I trusted my life with you, when you would treat your mother like that.</p>
<p>I bet you'd let me get spit-roasted by Latin Kings just like that, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't follow this conversation.</p>
<p>Where is my mother?</p>
<p>And if you think I'm paying the 40 grand you owe that flight school, you got another thing coming!</p>
<p>I owe them? I can't afford that.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Well, then you probably can't afford the bin 'em joint, 'cause that shit ain't free, bozo!</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>I'm out of here! Have a nice life!</p>
<p>And... kiss my ass, dirtbag.</p>
<p>I can't afford any of this!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This powder is a major histamine toxin.</p>
<p>The second Dennis drinks it, his throat's just gonna start to seize right up.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Mac, you jab him with that EpiPen... you save his life.</p>
<p>After a few minutes?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>15, 20 tops. Just until he flatlines. Then you bring him back.</p>
<p>Uh, no, Dee, we're not gonna do that.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>You're not gonna poison him?</p>
<p>You don't think Dennis is gonna see right through this silly ruse?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah. Now, Frank, on the other hand...</p>
<p>Yeah. Now, Frank's not gonna see through it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So-so that's why we invited Frank.</p>
<p>Because Charlie and I can jump to action and save Frank's life.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
<p>Now... Yeah. Now, of course, Dennis will see through that ruse as well, but he'll be very impressed with how far I'm willing to go to prove my worth to him.</p>
<p>Then Dennis will love me.</p>
<p>Frank's not gonna read into any of this.</p>
<p>He's just gonna be happy that I saved him.</p>
<p>Listen, consider the flatline though, okay?</p>
<p>'Cause I really got to know what people see on the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah. They're coming. Shut up. Shut up.</p>
<p>Shut up, Dee. Dee.</p>
<p>Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.</p>
<p>Frank! Dennis!</p>
<p>Here, uh, come-come on. Have a seat.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us, guys.</p>
<p>Uh, Frank, I, uh... I picked up your hair for you, so...</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis grunts</em> )</p>
<p>Dennis, you're looking better.</p>
<p>I'm feeling better, Mac, no thanks to you.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, I'd-I'd like to make a quick toast, if I could, before we begin.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Why?</p>
<p>Why are you people all here?</p>
<p>Hey, man, don't interrupt, okay?</p>
<p>We're not ready to order. Go.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn't take your order if I wanted to, because I'm just here to beg for my job back, thanks to this guy.</p>
<p>Do I know you?</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on here.</p>
<p>Can I get a whiskey, pal?</p>
<p>Can I have one as well?</p>
<p>Okay, guys, uh, before we begin, I-I'd like to make a-a quick speech.</p>
<p>Frank... ( <em>Exhales</em> ) look, we all understand why you were mad at us.</p>
<p>You have every right to be. But I'd like to make a peace offering.</p>
<p>I sharpened my teeth, FYI.</p>
<p>( <em>Teeth click</em> )</p>
<p>That's good. Wish you'd let me do it, but...</p>
<p>Please don't interrupt. I...</p>
<p>Charlie, would... could you get to the...</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Uh...</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> ) Over here is the peace offering.</p>
<p>Oh. Whoa. Is that a... is that a shake?</p>
<p>Yeah. Can you guys just not interrupt me though?</p>
<p>Can I have that, please?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: No.</p>
<p>It's not for you.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh...</p>
<p>No. Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>Because th-that's blue, and you don't like blue, Dennis.</p>
<p>Uh, well, I would very much like to have it, because I do feel like the shakes are finally kicking in and that's why I'm feeling a little bit better, so...</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no, it's not for him, okay?</p>
<p>It's for Frank.</p>
<p>I'm not interested.</p>
<p>He doesn't want it, so I would like to have it, please.</p>
<p>Absolutely not. I forbid it.</p>
<p>Stop trying to prove yourself to me in all the wrong ways, Mac.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, Frank, just drink the shake, okay?</p>
<p>You have to have it.</p>
<p>He doesn't want it!</p>
<p>Somebody drink it!</p>
<p>Give it to Dennis, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Give it to me!</p>
<p>No! Absolutely not!</p>
<p>Why not, goddamn it?</p>
<p>Because it's poisoned!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Uh, what?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: I had to tell him!</p>
<p>He was gonna...</p>
<p>Oh, come on! ( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>It was gonna be his blood and...</p>
<p>There's poison in it.</p>
<p>We poisoned it.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>It has a little bit of poison in it.</p>
<p>It has poison in it.</p>
<p>Poison in it.</p>
<p>It's got... It's poisoned.</p>
<p>You were gonna poison me, Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I was as well.</p>
<p>It's just... But I was gonna save you, dude.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Like, right afterward.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>I should've done that in the first place, man.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Shut up, Mac!</p>
<p>You're stepping on my...</p>
<p>Look, Frank, I'm sorry, dude.</p>
<p>I screwed up, man.</p>
<p>I should've saved you, and I'll always save you from now on, I promise.</p>
<p>Thanks, Charlie.</p>
<p>I knew you had my back.</p>
<p>And I had your back, too, with the plan.</p>
<p>I was gonna... do the plan...</p>
<p>Yeah, Mac glommed on to my thing and...</p>
<p>Yeah, and save Frank.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you were gonna be impressed by that and see that you need me as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Okay. I think I understand.</p>
<p>So you were still gonna rely on a decision that somebody else made, only, this time, you were potentially gonna kill a man?</p>
<p>Are you not pleased?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Holy shit. I think Dee drank the shake.</p>
<p>Dee, did you... Dee?</p>
<p><strong>Mac and Charlie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Oh, Dee!</p>
<p>( <em>Wheezing</em> )</p>
<p>That's okay. I have this.</p>
<p>Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Hit her with it, man.</p>
<p>All right, go.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm telling you to do it.</p>
<p>I don't need you to tell me what to do, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'm going to make my own decision.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac, now is not the time for this...</p>
<p>Charlie, shut up! I'm done with your plans.</p>
<p>She ain't moving, man.</p>
<p>She wanted to see the other side, and I want Dennis to see that I can make my own decision.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! What is wrong with you people?!</p>
<p>( <em>Exhales</em> ) Okay.</p>
<p>Uh... Ah. ( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Gasps loudly</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Exclaims, gasps</em> ) I saw it!</p>
<p>( <em>Gasps</em> ) I saw the other side. I didn't like it.</p>
<p>I hated it. It was just blackness.</p>
<p>There's nothing there. It's just dark.</p>
<p>That's it. Just lights out. I don't want to do that anymore.</p>
<p>I don't want to live on the edge. I don't want to die. Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, whoever you are.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, dude, can we get some, like, bread sticks and menus and, you know...</p>
<p><strong>Mac/Dee/Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, we've been here a while.</p>
<p>Dinner and a show.</p>
<p>( <em>Trio chanting backwards</em> )</p>
