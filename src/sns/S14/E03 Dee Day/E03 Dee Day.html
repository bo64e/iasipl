<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, now put your arms back.</p>
<p>You're like a... you're like a rocket ship, okay?</p>
<p>Now left.</p>
<p>Now right. Now left. Now right. Now go lower.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, come on. Come...</p>
<p>Can you guys go lower?</p>
<p>Dennis, is this really necessary?</p>
<p>Mac, you have the tendon dexterity of a sow, so yes, it's necessary. Guys, we're about to embark on the most important 24 hours of our lives here.</p>
<p>Okay, it's important to stay limber and loose.</p>
<p>Uh, yes. Very good, Charlie.</p>
<p>Can we just start?</p>
<p>No, we can't just start, okay?</p>
<p>Preparation is the key to victory.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yes, Charlie.</p>
<p>You're really nailing this today.</p>
<p>I got my eye on you. Okay.</p>
<p>Now, does everybody know what they're supposed to do?</p>
<p>Yes. Dennis, I know exactly what you told us to do.</p>
<p>I've memorized it. I know where to be and when to be at all times.</p>
<p>Okay, good. Yeah.</p>
<p>Needy and desperate for approval, but, uh, good. Charlie.</p>
<p>( <em>Blows</em> )</p>
<p>Now look at that. You see that?</p>
<p>With one little gesture, he tells me everything I need to know.</p>
<p>That wordless display of confidence earns my confidence.</p>
<p>Don't. I did it already.</p>
<p>You're so desperate.</p>
<p>I thought it was cool.</p>
<p>Okay, now, listen. Guys, guys.</p>
<p>We have exactly one day to pull this off, so everything needs to be executed to absolute perfection.</p>
<p>And, gentlemen, if we do that, well, the world is our oyster.</p>
<p>Don't say "oyster." Say "clam."</p>
<p>The world's our clam?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like clams better.</p>
<p>You like clams? Well, that doesn't sound very good.</p>
<p>They're both shellfish, so it's kind of the same, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah. One's disgusting, and one's delicious.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I personally prefer barnacles. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's some meat in there.</p>
<p>I like abalone.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Well, okay, guys.</p>
<p>Abalone's interesting.</p>
<p>I'm a clam person.</p>
<p>Seagulls...</p>
<p>Oh, mussels. What about mussels?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right, guys.</p>
<p>Let's not get into a whole thing. We're getting derailed, okay? Uh...</p>
<p>We can spend the whole day talking about which shell creatures we do or don't prefer or enjoy at any given moment.</p>
<p>That's not what we're doing here.</p>
<p>Okay, look, we put in the work.</p>
<p>Right? We're ready. We've done our dry run.</p>
<p>And if we put our minds to it, nothing, absolutely nothing can stand in our way.</p>
<p>World is our clam.</p>
<p>Bring it in, boys.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>♪ Uh, Dee is in the house ♪<br />
♪ Uh, Dee is in the house, uh, Dee is in the house ♪<br />
♪ Uh, Dee is in the house. ♪</p>
<p>First things first, we got to ditch Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's ditch her.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Guys, I am so excited to get started.</p>
<p>Get started on what?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. You forgot.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ): Oh, that makes it so much better.</p>
<p>Oh, guys.</p>
<p>From noon today until noon tomorrow, it's Dee Day.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I completely forgot.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>No, I...</p>
<p>No, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I know, I know. See, we did all your days, and now it's my turn.</p>
<p>So that means, for the next 24 hours, you got to do everything I tell you to do, and you got to listen to me.</p>
<p>And you can't complain, otherwise you're gonna get one of these.</p>
<p>( <em>Air horn blares</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>And I tack another day on.</p>
<p>Dee, please, please don't do this to us.</p>
<p>Oh, you better cram your insults in now while you got... oh, few more seconds left, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You... ( <em>Stammers</em> )</p>
<p>Dee's a bird!</p>
<p>( <em>Frantic shouting</em> )</p>
<p>Dee Day begins in three...</p>
<p>Dee's a bird! You're a bird!</p>
<p>...two...</p>
<p>You're a bird! ( <em>Shouts</em> )</p>
<p>I hate you, bird!</p>
<p>You're a stupid...!</p>
<p>...one.</p>
<p>( <em>Clock chiming, cuckooing</em> )</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p>As we all know, you guys just love to talk and talk about why men this and why God that and on and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And I-I can't even begin to count the number of pointless monologues I've been forced to sit through.</p>
<p>But not today. Today, it's you who will be forced to sit and just listen.</p>
<p>And my first topic?</p>
<p>My feelings.</p>
<p>That's fair.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yeah, I'm into it.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm excited.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Thought you would be.</p>
<p>Now, when I wake up in the morning, I feel sad.</p>
<p>And I feel sad for a very long...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: ( <em>Groans</em> ) Today of all days, and now I'm being forced to listen to her feelings?</p>
<p>I won't do it. And who cares about her feelings anyway?</p>
<p>Nobody, that's who.</p>
<p>What about my feelings? Now, that's interesting, okay?</p>
<p>Plus, the plan. We can't afford to waste a second, and these pea-brains are probably forgetting their parts with every second that passes by.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Uh-oh. I'm forgetting my part of the plan with every second that goes by.</p>
<p>Dennis is gonna yell at me again.</p>
<p>Hey, why was Charlie outshining me earlier?</p>
<p>I mean, what's that all about?</p>
<p>It's like he wants something from Dennis.</p>
<p>But what?</p>
<p>Attention? Love?</p>
<p>Why'd he throw me that look? Does he want to replace me?</p>
<p>Is that what's going on? What the hell does he want?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I'm pretty sure Dennis has candy.</p>
<p>I heard a crinkle in his pocket that sounded like the wrapper of a candy.</p>
<p>I gave Mac a look to let him know that I figured out Dennis has candy.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if we nail this plan, he'll give us some candy.</p>
<p>I want that candy.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: You know who eats raw shellfish?</p>
<p>Seagulls, that's who.</p>
<p>Clams you bake. Clams you fry.</p>
<p>Pop a rubber band around them, stuff them full of bread, boil them shits for an hour.</p>
<p>There's a million ways you can prepare a clam.</p>
<p>"Make the world your clam."</p>
<p>Just sounds better.</p>
<p>And that, I believe, is the reason for all of this toxic masculinity.</p>
<p>Would you agree?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well...</p>
<p>A-Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah. Everything...</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Everything you were saying, we were totally listening.</p>
<p>That's totally true.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, cool. Um, I'm gonna go take a quick squirt 'cause that beer just went right through me, and then we'll move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dee.</p>
<p>Sounds fun.</p>
<p>All right, Dee.</p>
<p>Sounds fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dee, this is gonna be great.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>This is really cool.</p>
<p>So excited. So excited.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this a lot.</p>
<p>Goddamn bird!</p>
<p>( <em>Grunts</em> )</p>
<p>I'm gonna...</p>
<p>Where's the scream pillow?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Guys, wait. We can still pull this thing off.</p>
<p>We can still pull this thing off.</p>
<p>I-I just came up with another plan.</p>
<p>It was actually based on what Dee just did.</p>
<p>She just went to the bathroom. See, everybody's got to take a dump at least once in every 24-hour period.</p>
<p>This got me thinking, right? So, at some point today, each and every one of us will have to take a shit, right?</p>
<p>We're gonna have to go find a bathroom, and at that point, you will go and execute your part of the plan.</p>
<p>Sounds good. That's good.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>See what I'm saying? All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So, Charlie, now it is time for you to take your shit.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Is there time?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, great. Nice.</p>
<p>And then, Charlie, go poop, and then we'll get started.</p>
<p>What? No, that's not what he's talking about, Mac.</p>
<p>What he means is that it's time for me to go to the school, break in using my old janitor's key, right?</p>
<p>Go into the nurse's office, 'cause he's probably still on his lunch break.</p>
<p>Make the call. Call the valet.</p>
<p>Let him know that his kid's "sick" and needs to be "picked up from school" ASAP.</p>
<p>My man. With that kind of focus, we're gonna be able to pull this thing off.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Way to go.</p>
<p>Yeah! And then when he's there, that's when he poops.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>Totally wrong. Just go, Charlie. Go.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>A-And keep this kind of good focus in mind when it comes to what's inside your pants, 'cause I want that, man.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. All right, great.</p>
<p>I want what's in your pants.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>( <em>Door opens</em> )</p>
<p>Okay. Where's Charlie?</p>
<p>He had to take a shit.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I, too, have to take a shit now, as well.</p>
<p>Oh, what?</p>
<p>No. What, now? No.</p>
<p>Well, make up your mind, or I-I do the horn.</p>
<p>Okay. It is a bit of an emergency.</p>
<p>No, it isn't.</p>
<p>He... You can, you can hold it. He's gonna hold it.</p>
<p>( <em>School bell ringing</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Knock, knock, knock.</p>
<p>Hey! How you doing, old Terry?</p>
<p>Old buddy, old pal!</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Do I know you?</p>
<p>Ah, come on, it's me! It's Charlie! Remember?</p>
<p>I used to be the janitor here a few years back.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I got fired on account of a relationship I was having with a Juggalo child, you know.</p>
<p>That's not the point. The point is though I got my old job back.</p>
<p>I'm ready to have new relationships with the children.</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering how I got in the building, that's how.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if memory serves, you usually take your lunch break about now.</p>
<p>So how about you pop on out, eat some lunch, and I'll clean up your office.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, I ate already.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>Lunch is at noon. It's 12:30.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Look at that there.</p>
<p>You know what happened though, Terry, was I got a little held up on account of it being Dee Day and all.</p>
<p>It's not D-Day.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Actually, Terry, I should tell you this.</p>
<p>Um, I saw some kids breaking in to your car outside.</p>
<p>I ride a bike.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's what I meant.</p>
<p>They were breaking on in to your bicycle.</p>
<p>Kicked it in half. Filled it with horse manure.</p>
<p>Kind of a prank, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't believe you.</p>
<p>Well, only one way to find out. Better pop outside, take a peek.</p>
<p>My bike is fine.</p>
<p>One step ahead of me, aren't you, Terry?</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ): Okay, you know what happened?</p>
<p>Dee Day just threw everything off, okay?</p>
<p>So I'm just gonna slide on in here.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm gonna make a little phone call.</p>
<p>No big deal. And I'm not gonna make a phone call.</p>
<p>I'll just have some candy, then.</p>
<p>And I'm not gonna have any candy 'cause candy's for the kids.</p>
<p>Terry, this has been an unfortunate, uh...</p>
<p>Hey, can I use your phone and pretend to be you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay. That's strike three on my, uh, count.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm gonna fuck your bike up, Terry.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>( <em>Taiwanese accent</em> ): Charlie, you would not believe what we're doing.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. What is that?</p>
<p>( <em>Puerto Rican accent</em> ): Ladies just doing it for themselves. I'm just playing.</p>
<p>I'm Martina Martinez.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p>You don't have to do the accent anymore, Frank. You're offstage.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. This is so racist, right?</p>
<p>It's insanely racist.</p>
<p>We didn't want to do it, but you know, Dee's humor is so lowbrow.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. What is she...?</p>
<p>Uh, she wants to do a whole retrospective of her stupid characters.</p>
<p>Wrote a play about it.</p>
<p>Her characters suck!</p>
<p>I know!</p>
<p>Her characters suck!</p>
<p>( <em>Irish accent</em> ): Charlie, thank God you're here.</p>
<p>Go get into costume. We're up next.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Dennis.</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis, uh, you're offstage, so y-you don't have to do the accent anymore.</p>
<p>That's why you suck at everything, Maxie.</p>
<p>I say if you're gonna do a racist stereotype, you best do it right. I mean, that's a bit much, but you know.</p>
<p>Oh, uh, where are we with the phone call?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p>I wasn't able to make it. I was not able to make the call, guys.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Okay, look.</p>
<p>Here's what we'll do. I'll-I'll go to the valet myself, okay?</p>
<p>I'll go to the restaurant. I'll get the key.</p>
<p>I-I can make it work, Dennis, all right? Don't get mad.</p>
<p>Who's desperate now, Charlie?</p>
<p>Shut up, Mac, you racist!</p>
<p>I'm not racist! She's racist! She's the one that's racist!</p>
<p>She's making us do it.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Hey, turkeys!</p>
<p>Shh. Shh.</p>
<p>What's the holdup in there?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Look, uh, you stay here, Charlie.</p>
<p>Um, Mac, Frank, you go down there, okay?</p>
<p>Um, you're not on again till the second act.</p>
<p>I won't let you down, Dennis.</p>
<p>Great. Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Charlie. Charlie, go get into your costume.</p>
<p>We got to learn a song.</p>
<p>What? A song?</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>The glue on these teeth is insane.</p>
<p>I would never be able to get them off and on in time.</p>
<p>Ah, this makeup is making me sick.</p>
<p>I'm... I feel awful.</p>
<p>It's not the makeup, Frank.</p>
<p>It's the bag of clams you made us stop before we came here.</p>
<p>The clam is fine.</p>
<p>If w-we got a bag of oysters, those would've made us really sick.</p>
<p>Whatever, dude. Just focus, all right?</p>
<p>The councilwoman's gonna be here any second.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, what do we got to do now?</p>
<p>Charlie screwed up the whole thing with the valet.</p>
<p>Now how are we gonna get her keys?</p>
<p>All right, well, I got a plan.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Now, when the valet gets into the next car, I want you to go to your car, and I want you to ram him, all right?</p>
<p>Nothing crazy, but it's got to be believable, all right?</p>
<p>Then, I'll step in as the valet.</p>
<p>I'll get the councilwoman's keys.</p>
<p>I'll go get a copy made. I'll be back here ASAP.</p>
<p>I have, I have a suggestion. I mean, if you want... if you want it to be really believable... the car accident... then I think you should do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not saying out loud why you should be the one to have the car accident, but I think it would play much better.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that you're working on your prejudices, Frank. I, too, am trying to become a better man and... but I just...</p>
<p>I-I-I really think that, unfortunately, it is a better plan.</p>
<p>It's a good plan.</p>
<p>So, uh, I'm just gonna go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>Whispering</em> ): Okay. Okay, he's coming. Oh, good.</p>
<p>You go get the keys. I'm gonna go do the acc...</p>

<p>Oh, are you okay?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I'm-I'm... I'm fine. I'm aces. It's just... It's just that I got a little skin thing going on.</p>
<p>But I-I... I may get sick, but it won't be clams. It won't be the clams, because if it was clams... ( <em>Gags</em> ) ...clams and I was sick, it would be all over the pavement.</p>
<p>( <em>Gagging</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, uh, I'm sorry, but is there someone else that can take my car from me?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>

<p>And, yeah, it's, uh...</p>
<p>It's great.</p>
<p>Birds are m-majestical.</p>
<p>Ooh, fun bird fact.</p>
<p>The ostrich's eyes are bigger than its brain.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>That's... cool.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Great bird.</p>
<p>It's a good bird.</p>
<p>Ostriches are good birds.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, I have to take another piss.</p>
<p>I'll be back.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>See ya, Dee. We're just gonna look at... look for some more birds that we love.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll keep on, uh...</p>
<p>Yeah, just gonna...</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I want to scream "bird," I want to scream "bird."</p>
<p>I want to scream, "Bird! Bird!"</p>
<p>That would be so good.</p>
<p>Do you want me to do it for you, Dennis?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Don't do it. She's probably hiding behind a tree.</p>
<p>Yeah. What's going on with you?</p>
<p>Why are you so off your game today?</p>
<p>Well, I... Charlie has been outshining me all day, and I want to shine for you, Dennis, so I'm just...</p>
<p>I haven't been outshining you. I was just throwing you looks because I wanted the candy, but I was gonna share it with you.</p>
<p>What candy?</p>
<p>Dennis has candy in his pocket.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, can we get back to talking about the plan?</p>
<p>You have candy?</p>
<p>Look, w-we're getting off track here.</p>
<p>Dennis has candy?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I heard it crinkle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want that candy, man.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yes, I have candy.</p>
<p>All right? Of course I have candy.</p>
<p>I keep candy in my pocket sometimes so that I can get Charlie's focus.</p>
<p>It was working like a charm, man.</p>
<p>I was zoned in on everything you were saying.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it was working; the whole goddamn thing was working till Dee came through with this Dee Day bullshit.</p>
<p>Are we gonna get the candy, or are you gonna keep it in your pocket all day?</p>
<p>I'll have some candy.</p>
<p>Here's the candy.</p>
<p>Yeah! Yes, I knew it.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh! I want...</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Children. Children.</p>
<p>Good candy, good candy.</p>
<p>This is good candy.</p>
<p>I don't need the candy anymore anyway, 'cause I have a backup plan.</p>
<p>We don't need the councilwoman's keys anymore to get into her house, because we have me. All right?</p>
<p>So I'll peel off. I'll go seduce her.</p>
<p>She'll invite me into her house, where I'll bang her as fast as I possibly can, and then, while she's cleaning up afterwards, I'll set all of her clocks back, causing her to sleep late and miss the boat, okay?</p>
<p>So when Dee comes back, just tell her I had to go take my shit.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Nice, man. All right.</p>
<p>Watch out!</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Where you rushing off to?</p>
<p>Oh, I-I got to take a shit.</p>
<p>Do ya?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll let you do that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But real quick first.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something with you.</p>
<p>I really have to shit, Dee.</p>
<p>Yeah, this'll be fast.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Oh, these are makeup wipes.</p>
<p>So that you can remove your makeup.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Makeup?</p>
<p>I'm not wearing any makeup.</p>
<p>Then it won't be an issue.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm wearing a little bit of concealer.</p>
<p>Is that what you're talking about having me remove?</p>
<p>Well, I'm talking about the concealer, yes.</p>
<p>But I'm talking about the rest of the makeup, the tape you have behind your jaw and your eyes.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the hair paint.</p>
<p>I'm talking about all of it.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: What a nice restaurant this is, filled with attractive, professional-looking people.</p>
<p>You know what it is? It's the kind of place where you wouldn't want to stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>How are you liking it, Dennis?</p>
<p>Yes, very nice.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Yes.</p>
<p>Would you like to go introduce yourself to some ladies?</p>
<p>No, uh, I-I'm okay. Uh, no.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll go round some up and bring them to you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Hey, don't mind her, dude.</p>
<p>Y-You look great.</p>
<p>Holy shit. That's her.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>The councilwoman.</p>
<p>She's right there.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Who? Right there?</p>
<p>Right there. That's her.</p>
<p>Right there? Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, this is incredible. What are the odds?</p>
<p>That's her, yeah.</p>
<p>Dee has no idea how good this is for us.</p>
<p>Dennis, go do your thing.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>( <em>Stammers</em> ): No, I-I...</p>
<p>I can't. No.</p>
<p>Buddy, makeup or not, you are the Golden God.</p>
<p>It's all about what's in here.</p>
<p>Oh. Is your pec deflated?</p>
<p>Sh-She took his pads out.</p>
<p>Yeah, he had...</p>
<p>Oh, your pec pads.</p>
<p>He had some pads.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, either way, man, you can do it. You're our only hope.</p>
<p>I can do this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>That's the attitude.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>You're looking good.</p>
<p>You got it. You got this. You got this.</p>
<p>You got this. You got this.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>He ain't got this.</p>
<p>That's what his soul looks like.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>Did I frighten you?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm not, I'm not, uh... I'm Dennis.</p>
<p>Do you like hard candy?</p>
<p>I have candies. Oh, you know what?</p>
<p>Actually, I don't. Scratch that. I...</p>
<p>I threw all the hard candies at those idiot children.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Oysters or clams?</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>Oysters, obviously.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) You know?</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Plus, like, they-they...</p>
<p>You can, you can get sick off clams.</p>
<p>Like, I got real sick off clams when I was, like...</p>
<p>Anything can make you throw up if you're, if you're, uh... if it's gone bad.</p>
<p>You know, my dad was, like, throwing up off...</p>
<p>He's not really my dad, but you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But anyway, it's oysters for me. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Clears throat softly</em> )</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Hey, uh, you know what? I just realized.</p>
<p>We don't have a lot of time, so let's...</p>
<p>We should get this over with. Can I get your house key?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We don't, uh, have to have sex like this.</p>
<p>I can, I can... I can put another man's face on.</p>
<p>If you give me your house key, I can go to your house and put on some of your makeup...</p>
<p>Get away from me.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Um, uh, we... I'm supposed to be taking a shit right now.</p>
<p>And so... Yeah.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>What are you doing to this woman?</p>
<p>Uh, it was my turn to take a shit, and then I was gonna do it with her.</p>
<p>I am so sorry about him. Okay?</p>
<p>This man is clearly a monster, and he will be punished accordingly.</p>
<p>G-Go wait for me over there, monster.</p>
<p>We'll find another woman.</p>
<p>It's Dee Day.</p>
<p>♪</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Just so you know, you look... a lot better now, but you looked fine.</p>
<p>I just don't look good when I haven't got enough sleep.</p>
<p>And I got a little nap in, so, you know, I'm back.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I bet you the city council's voted already.</p>
<p>Dying to figure out which way they voted.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, dude.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. Like, the bird bitch ruined everything.</p>
<p>We had a plan. We had...</p>
<p>Shh. Keep your voice down.</p>
<p>We may have lost this one, but the most important thing is that we don't get another Dee Day.</p>
<p>Oh, man. That's, like, the 20th piss I took today.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, hey, it's important to stay hydrated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Knock it off. Looks like you guys are gonna make it.</p>
<p>And I have to say, I am very impressed that you were able to focus on anything other than yourselves for one entire day.</p>
<p>Well, Dee, it's been a real pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, we haven't made it yet, so...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We've enjoyed it.</p>
<p>It's been really great.</p>
<p>And Dee Day ends officially in three, two, one.</p>
<p>( <em>Clock chiming, cuckooing</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Frank sighs</em> )</p>
<p>All right, let me have it. Pile it on me.</p>
<p>News.</p>
<p>Pile it on me.</p>
<p>TV. TV. Yeah, put the...</p>
<p>Channel 7. Channel 7.</p>
<p>Put the news on. Put the news on.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What channel? What channel?</p>
<p>S-Seven? Seven?</p>
<p>Yeah, it might be.</p>
<p>( <em>News theme plays</em> )</p>
<p>In a stunning upset, local ordinance LC-103 passed today.</p>
<p>The controversial proposal actually legalizes public urination.</p>
<p>It passed! It passed!</p>
<p>It passed! It passed!</p>
<p>It passed!</p>
<p>( <em>Men cheering, laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>It passed anyway.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>What passed?</p>
<p>Dee, we have been working for weeks on a very intricate plan to ensure the passage of that ordinance.</p>
<p>Yeah. All we had to do was stop one city councilwoman from voting, that was it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. So we had this ingenious plan to, uh, get ahold of her keys, sneak into her house and, uh, turn all of her clocks back, mess with her phones a little bit or whatever...</p>
<p>It was a good plan.</p>
<p>...so that she would sleep too late, she would miss the vote, and the ordinance would pass, and it passed!</p>
<p>( <em>Dennis and charlie laugh</em> )</p>
<p>We knew that she would be the one dissenting vote.</p>
<p>So we had to stop her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Oh, well, it's a group...</p>
<p>Uh, well, yeah.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: It's all men and she was the one lady.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Men are free once again...</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We are free!</p>
<p>...to relieve themselves where God intended.</p>
<p>You guys are idiots!</p>
<p>That's the most ludicrous thing I've ever even heard.</p>
<p>Why didn't you just go and slash her tires, like, five minutes before she had to leave for the meeting?</p>
<p>Oh. Oh.</p>
<p>What? Oh, yeah, just do that.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, just do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Dee, you know what? You don't get it. Okay?</p>
<p>Women will never understand what it's like to be a man.</p>
<p>Like, we just, like, we need to piss in public, okay?</p>
<p>We need to hatch plans ( <em>Laughs</em> ) that actually work.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Dee, your plan would not have worked.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? My plan did work, jackass.</p>
<p>I got close enough to the councilwoman in the restaurant to steal her wallet, got her address, and then replaced the wallet without her seeing.</p>
<p>And then, in the middle of the night when I told you guys I was going to "take a shit" like you were doing all goddamn day, I snuck over and I slashed her tires.</p>
<p>You did? Why?</p>
<p>Did you see how many times I peed today?</p>
<p>I have a teeny, tiny, little bladder.</p>
<p>I want to be able to pee on the street if I have to.</p>
<p>Oh! You?</p>
<p>Ugh! Gross.</p>
<p>In front of us?</p>
<p>Just out there in the public?</p>
<p>A woman?</p>
<p>Squat?</p>
<p>Dee, you nasty.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Nasty.</p>
<p>Dee, you n...</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> ): She's so nasty.</p>
<p>No, you know what? You guys are just pissed because I outsmarted you.</p>
<p>Oh, you outsmarted us?</p>
<p>You're embarrassed.</p>
<p>Dee, ( <em>Chuckles</em> ) you spent the entirety of Dee Day coming up with a plan that eventually led to us getting exactly what we want, so...</p>
<p>We scored.</p>
<p>You're a stupid bird.</p>
<p>Don't even bother trying to explain it to her.</p>
<p>Her tiny bird brain will never get it.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Birds don't understand plans.</p>
<p>What about this one? Dee's a bird.</p>
<p>( <em>Laughs</em> )</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh.</p>
<p>You should all probably check your phones.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis and Charlie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Just 'cause I pushed the cuckoo clock ahead an hour.</p>
<p>( <em>Clock chimes</em> )</p>
<p>No. Shut up.</p>
<p>Here's the problem, guys.</p>
<p>You just insulted me on Dee Day.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. God.</p>
<p>Oh, no, wait...</p>
<p>You know what that earns you?</p>
<p>Another day of Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no!</p>
