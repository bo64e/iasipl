<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>Come on, hurry up, guys. I want to get a good seat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: <em>What do you mean you want to get... Charlie, this is a sexual harassment seminar.</em></p>
<p>There are no "good seats." Where are you going?</p>
<p>Up front.</p>
<p>This is so unfair.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't happen to, like, loads of women all the time, but I don't harass anybody, so why am I here?</p>
<p>Because some Internet warrior put Paddy's on a list of unsafe places for women and we can't have that, okay?</p>
<p>Not in this climate.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Ugh! You kids and your climates.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I banged all my secretaries.</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>That's the way you did it.</p>
<p>You hire some girl with no experience, you bang her, you promote her.</p>
<p>It's a win-win situation for everybody, except for the wives.</p>
<p>Frank, modulate your volume, okay? This is serious, okay?</p>
<p>The future of Paddy's depends on us completing this seminar.</p>
<p>You guys should be really worried.</p>
<p>I'm not worried about anything, man. If anyone should be worried about weird shit with women, it's you, bro.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>The only reason we're here is because you DENNIS'd someone probably and she put us on the list. We're only here 'cause of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you perv. You happy now?</p>
<p>You happy?</p>
<p>Happy?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) You guys, this isn't about me.</p>
<p>I don't know if you noticed, but women are on a little bit of a rampage right now and anyone could be taken down at any moment, so, you know, no, I'm not happy right now.</p>
<p>Who could possibly be happy right now?</p>
<p>Hey-o!</p>
<p>Who's ready to party?!</p>
<p>♪ Time's up, time's up, time's up ♪<br />
♪ Time's up, time's up, time's up. ♪</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>Hello. I'm Kate.</p>
<p>And I want to begin today by addressing the reason that we're all here, the so-called "Shitty Bar List" of unsafe places for women.</p>
<p>Ah, yes. Uh, just a quick question.</p>
<p>How many points do we need?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, points?</p>
<p>Yeah, how many points do we need to score to get our name taken off the list?</p>
<p>Oh. No, there's no points.</p>
<p>Everything is graded by points, right?</p>
<p>I mean, otherwise, how could the Eagles have won the Super Bowl, right?</p>
<p>All you have to do is complete the seminar and then your bar will have its name removed from the list.</p>
<p>There you go. Simple.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, but our-our name shouldn't even be on that list 'cause, like, we don't really have any history of misbehavior at Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure a lot of people here today feel that way, but I encourage you to keep your minds open...</p>
<p>And your dicks in your pants. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Ma'am, that kind of language is inappropriate in a professional setting.</p>
<p>That's one of the things that you'll learn in the seminar.</p>
<p>Uh, yes? Do you have a question?</p>
<p>Statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Okay. I'm just trying to get through the introduction here, but since you asked, the federal law is 300 days from the last act, depending on the state and...</p>
<p>Sir, are you leaving?</p>
<p>Frank!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>They got nothing on me past '92, tops.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hold on a second there.</p>
<p>Uh, pardon me, Kate, but, um, aren't some states considering doing away with the statute of limitations altogether?</p>
<p>Some states like, uh, Nevada?</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Yes, that's right.</p>
<p>Can they do that?</p>
<p>It's possible. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Nevada, huh?</p>
<p>Ah, it's getting warm in here.</p>
<p>Uh, got to make some calls. shit.</p>
<p>You can continue now.</p>
<p>I promise you there will be no further interruptions.</p>
<p>Right. We're gonna jump right into the group work.</p>
<p>Half of you are gonna go with me and the rest will be led by my associate Alan.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone. I'm Alan.</p>
<p>Oh! Here comes the boss man.</p>
<p>Finally, a dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, cool. He's in charge.</p>
<p>Uh, ma'am? Could we go with Alan, please?</p>
<p>Actually, I think we should split your group up.</p>
<p>That's, uh, that's gonna be a lot harder for me to keep tabs on you guys.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Dennis.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make you so proud.</p>
<p>I'm gonna work really hard and get all the points and...</p>
<p>What is with you and the points?</p>
<p>There are no points. We established that.</p>
<p>Well, that's how the Eagles won the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>I know that's how the Eagles won the... but this isn't the Eagles. Okay?</p>
<p>This is a seminar.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Go Birds, though.</p>
<p>Oh, go Birds, go Birds.</p>
<p>All right, fine, go Birds. Yes.</p>
<p>I know. Go Birds. Get your hand off my knee.</p>
<p>Look, just sit here and do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: <em>So, in this room</em> we're going to be talking about harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>And thank you to Elliot who's agreed to play our boss.</p>
<p>I'll just need another volunteer from the group.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! Alan!</p>
<p>Alan! Alan! Alan!</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: I'll do it.</p>
<p>Uh, so, uh...</p>
<p>Alan! Alan!</p>
<p>Sir, would you mind just jumping in for me?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groans</em> )</p>
<p>Um, great. So just read from the script and I'll jump in as and when.</p>
<p>"Good morning, boss."</p>
<p>"Hello, Johnson. Have that report on my desk by 5:00.</p>
<p>"Hey, did you see the boobs on that new intern?"</p>
<p>And stop.</p>
<p>Now, can anyone tell me what the boss did wrong there?</p>
<p>Yeah. He mumbled his lines.</p>
<p>I didn't believe a word out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Uh, no, sorry. I mean in the scenario.</p>
<p>He-he used vulgar language.</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>B-But she didn't hear it.</p>
<p>This is just locker room talk between guys.</p>
<p>Now, that's actually a common misconception, okay?</p>
<p>Lewd comments can be a form of harassment even if directed to a third party.</p>
<p>But it's not for her. It's about her.</p>
<p>No, sorry. It's-it's actually, it's the employee who's talking to the boss that is the one that was offended.</p>
<p>What? Why?</p>
<p>No, no, no, the employee would find it hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, not this guy 'cause the boss sucks at telling jokes.</p>
<p>Well, also, we really don't know how funny the joke is yet 'cause we haven't seen the girl's boobs. Can we see them?</p>
<p>Okay. Uh, let's...</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ) let's switch gears.</p>
<p>Maybe try a different scenario. Thanks, gents.</p>
<p>Just, uh, uh, take a seat.</p>
<p>Um, so, uh, Mac, what is it that you do at the bar?</p>
<p>I am the head of security at Paddy's Pub.</p>
<p>He's our doorman.</p>
<p>No, he's just like our gay guy now.</p>
<p>No, well...</p>
<p>Great. So, you check IDs. That-that sort of thing.</p>
<p>He should.</p>
<p>Not once has he ever checked an ID.</p>
<p>It's one aspect of the job.</p>
<p>Yeah, he should.</p>
<p>Why don't you, why don't you hop up here and we'll do a little scenario that-that might be a little more familiar to you.</p>
<p>You are very tall.</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Now, should I take my shirt off for the scenario?</p>
<p>Because I feel like standing next to you, they're not gonna be as intimidated, but if I were to take my shirt off, they would be intimidated.</p>
<p>I'm not in the scenario.</p>
<p>We're good. We're good.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're okay.</p>
<p>We get it. We get it.</p>
<p>That's him doing his gay guy thing.</p>
<p>So, uh, can we also get a female customer?</p>
<p>Ooh, yeah.</p>
<p>A volunteer?</p>
<p>I will be the young, female customer.</p>
<p>"Young, female customer." Great, good. Yes.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, um, just, uh, do your job as you would normally and I will, um, you know, jump in if you cross over into any gray areas.</p>
<p>Okay. So what's my character?</p>
<p>Uh, you're just trying to get into the bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why?</p>
<p>To get a drink, I suppose.</p>
<p>Why? I just drank three beers on the way over.</p>
<p>You don't show up at a bar sober.</p>
<p>What a waste of money. What are you gonna...</p>
<p>Just you're trying to get into the bar.</p>
<p>I'm here for revenge.</p>
<p>Okay. Sure.</p>
<p>Alan, what's my character again?</p>
<p>You're the doorman.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And how many drinks have I had at this point?</p>
<p>You are... you're not in the scenario.</p>
<p>I've had five.</p>
<p>Okay. Marvelous.</p>
<p>Let's, uh, let's begin whenever you're ready.</p>
<p>( <em>clears throat</em> ) Excuse me, sir, have you...</p>
<p>( <em>all shouting</em> )</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie laughs</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Why did you do that?</p>
<p>Oh, well, well, she came at me, and it was sort of my instinct.</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>That was great, right?</p>
<p>You got me, like, a foot off the ground.</p>
<p>A-Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. No, it doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>Did it-did it make you feel humiliated?</p>
<p>Did it make you-make you feel small?</p>
<p>That's what it is, it made me feel teeny-tiny.</p>
<p>Like Thumbelina.</p>
<p>That's what I was going for. Thumbelina!</p>
<p>That's the highest I've ever gotten.</p>
<p>He's never gotten me that high before.</p>
<p>You're lucky I haven't called the police.</p>
<p>Why-why would you call the police?</p>
<p>Oh, wait. H-Hold on. Is that sexual harassment?</p>
<p>No, that is sexual assault.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Assault?</p>
<p>No. Dee, Dee. I did not assault you.</p>
<p>Please tell Alan that I did not assault you.</p>
<p>Well, now that I've gotten a little distance from the event.</p>
<p>Wha... No, Alan, we do this kind of stuff all the time.</p>
<p>W-Charlie, would you tell him?</p>
<p>He's gone.</p>
<p>You do this all the time?</p>
<p>Y-You've got a big problem, all right? She could press charges.</p>
<p>Could I?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: No! Dee. No.</p>
<p>He just said I could, so...</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>It just, i-it... did somebody turn up the heat?</p>
<p>Yeah, you sweating? You sweating a little bit, Ronald?</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>No, it's just the climate.</p>
<p>The term "sexual harassment," it wasn't coined until 1975, by a woman named Carmita Wood.</p>
<p>Carmita Wood. Oh. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) You really know your history.</p>
<p>Well, this is important stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p>God, get lost, Dee.</p>
<p>No way, I'm on a roll.</p>
<p>So who could tell me...</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: ( <em>clears throat</em> ) Hey.</p>
<p>Is it sexual harassment when a man constantly calls his female coworker a bird?</p>
<p>That depends. Is that a sexual innuendo of some kind?</p>
<p>Just a big dumb flightless bird.</p>
<p>Well, it's not very nice, but it's not sexual harassment.</p>
<p>( <em>quietly</em> ): ( <em>laughs</em> ) Nice try, you dumb bitch.</p>
<p>( <em>regular volume</em> ): Um, Kate, if I may, yeah.</p>
<p>Um, federal law really only recognizes two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo and hostile work environment.</p>
<p>That is very good, Dennis.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>No, no, don't do that.</p>
<p>This man is a monster. Believe you, me.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ): What?</p>
<p>He is the worst person I know.</p>
<p>Got to protect me on this, Larry.</p>
<p>I... start with the secretaries.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. Pants.</p>
<p>I was sweating through my clothes.</p>
<p>It's this damn climate.</p>
<p>Sir, that robe is inappropriate.</p>
<p>And I don't think...</p>
<p>Hon, I'm on the phone, you see?</p>
<p>I don't know. I bought her a Camaro. No...</p>
<p>You know I don't go Chinese.</p>
<p>I don't know why, I just don't.</p>
<p>Korean?</p>
<p>Oh, put her on the list.</p>
<p>I really did a number on her.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Why don't we take a break?</p>
<p>Got to get your shit together, Frank.</p>
<p>You...</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I was dead.</p>
<p>These vultures are picking my carcass clean.</p>
<p>Whoa, Frank. Hey, stop talking.</p>
<p>Where'd you get that robe?</p>
<p>Upstairs.</p>
<p>I got to get one of them, man. Nice.</p>
<p>Whoa. Wait, Jesus, Mac. What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p>I'm gonna be honest. The first half has not gone well.</p>
<p>You got exposed, too?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, he did. Big time.</p>
<p>He did a role-play thing, it went bad.</p>
<p>Wait, role-playing thing? Y-You were supposed to do nothing.</p>
<p>I mean, n-now you're all sweaty and twitchy?</p>
<p>Well, it's-it's so hot in here.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like they crank up the heat.</p>
<p>Oh, they cranked it up. I'm roasting.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Which one of you just grabbed my ass?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Did you see that? Did you see...</p>
<p>T-that is a problem for us.</p>
<p>T-Their powers are growing. Okay?</p>
<p>Now, we got to start taking this more seriously, okay?</p>
<p>Can you guys just go back in there and do nothing, okay?</p>
<p>Just don't say or do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: <em>Can anyone tell me</em> the two types of sexual harassment?</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, oh. Uh, uh, flirting and groping.</p>
<p>No! Uh, groping and-and dick pics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I know that sending dick pics is one of them.</p>
<p>You're kidding. Christ.</p>
<p>I got to shoot some texts.</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Actually, it's quid pro quo and hostile work environment.</p>
<p>Would you please stop interrupting me?</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ): Ooh, ooh, burn.</p>
<p>Please... And you.</p>
<p>Could you please sit down?</p>
<p>No, it's cool. I'm on your side.</p>
<p>There are no sides.</p>
<p>shit, I just looked at her tits.</p>
<p>Frank! Don't tell her that.</p>
<p>Okay, don't panic.</p>
<p>A passing glance is not sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Oh. I like your tactic here.</p>
<p>Get them all horny with your titties.</p>
<p>That's when they make their mistakes.</p>
<p>Ma'am, that's victim blaming.</p>
<p>No, I'm blaming Frank. He's been staring at your boobs this whole time. Still doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Frank!</p>
<p>What? I'm not allowed to like things anymore?</p>
<p>It's a compliment.</p>
<p>How is that a compliment?</p>
<p>Well, they're not <em>that</em> great.</p>
<p>Make her feel good.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey. Don't let them get to you.</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>Okay? Your tits are fine.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: <em>Okay, everybody,</em> if, uh, you could take a seat, please.</p>
<p>So now what we're gonna do is, uh, imagine a-a hypothetical scenario, uh, based right here in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>So, uh, i-imagine a-a woman, we'll call her "the waitress," who works at a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>( <em>clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>Now, i-in this particular instance, this waitress is being harassed by one of her customers.</p>
<p>He's following her home from work, uh, digging through her trash and calling her repeatedly, until she complains to her boss about it.</p>
<p>Now, the boss does nothing.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me who's legally at fault here?</p>
<p>Ooh. Wow, what do you think, Charlie?</p>
<p>I-I think The Waitress is.</p>
<p>Y-You know, 'cause, for-she doesn't realize that, like, true love is in front of her stupid face.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Why would she say that's an assault?</p>
<p>Hold on a second. Now, this is just a-this is just a hypothetical, uh, scenario that he's painting.</p>
<p>He's not getting the whole big picture, right?</p>
<p>Well, of course, it's a hypothetical.</p>
<p>I know, but maybe she, like, only thought like she wasn't into him, but then, like, 15 years later, when she needed a baby, like, really bad, and she'd been in and out of, like, a women's shelter, he banged her.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p>That-that doesn't mean that the customer didn't harass.</p>
<p>All right, well then, I think all of the customers' friends harassed her, too, because they all banged her.</p>
<p>I mean, he did.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>Oh, well, don't bring me into th...</p>
<p>This is a hypothetical scenario. I'm not involved.</p>
<p>Neither are you.</p>
<p>She also did hand stuff to Mac.</p>
<p>She did. I-It wasn't very good, though.</p>
<p>All right, look, are you trying to tell me that no matter what, it's always just gonna be the customer's fault?</p>
<p>It is, in fact, the boss's fault.</p>
<p>The boss.</p>
<p>Well, that makes sense. I always hated Seth.</p>
<p>He's a real creep.</p>
<p>Well, you don't know his name because this is hypothetical, and he didn't say t-that...</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause she just said what I-what I did to her wasn't harassment because Seth did it to her.</p>
<p>Sorry. I... Can I just make this very clear?</p>
<p>Okay? What the customer did was harassment.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes. <em>If</em> it were you.</p>
<p>And so, take in the information, but don't take it personally.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, technically, don't, like, I get, like, a free pass and stuff, 'cause I mean, I was molested.</p>
<p>( <em>audience murmuring</em> )</p>
<p>Ah... W-Well, now, actually, that is true.</p>
<p>He did get molested by his uncle Jack.</p>
<p>His-his uncle Jack got to him pretty good.</p>
<p>No, Uncle Jack never molested me.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I dodged him.</p>
<p>Oh, no, he got you. He got you.</p>
<p>He got you big time.</p>
<p>You weren't there.</p>
<p>You wrote a whole play about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did write a play.</p>
<p>I got molested by Dee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What? Oh, c-that's ludicrous.</p>
<p>No, it's true. Like, a couple years ago, she banged me, and I didn't want to do it.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. You had sex with Charlie?</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>You had sex with Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We, okay, it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll say.</p>
<p>I-It... I regret every second of it, but it was consensual.</p>
<p>It was not!</p>
<p>I totally wanted her to stop, and, like, I was very intimidated by her larger frame.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I can see that. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>I have a petite frame. I... i-it's a Thumbelina frame.</p>
<p>I don't... Not to me.</p>
<p>Y-You didn't tell me to stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I kept saying...</p>
<p>( <em>muffled protests</em> )</p>
<p>And you're like, "Shut up! Stop talking! Be still.</p>
<p>"Let me do my thing. I can't, I can't get off with you moving and talking and shit."</p>
<p>Oh, shit. Yup. That's ringing a bell.</p>
<p>Jesus, Dee. Ugh, God.</p>
<p>All right, but yeah. ( <em>stammers</em> )</p>
<p>Either way, It does... I can't molest you, you know?</p>
<p>It doesn't work that way 'cause I'm a woman and you're the man.</p>
<p>Right, right? Back me up, girlfriend.</p>
<p>Actually, a woman can sexually harass and even rape a man.</p>
<p>Is that what happened here?</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings, clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>Actually, maybe.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. You don't, you don't just throw around the-the "R" word, Kate. It's hot, right?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yello?</p>
<p>What? Then find her through the abortion records.</p>
<p>Can the group from Paddy's Pub please focus up.</p>
<p>You guys have been very disruptive.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should explain it more better because I'm totally confused about...</p>
<p>Maybe if you stopped interrupting.</p>
<p>Maybe if you two stopped sucking a fat dick.</p>
<p>You do suck a fat dick.</p>
<p>You've sucked a dick through this process.</p>
<p>What? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>After all of this, I ended up firing her?</p>
<p>( <em>all groaning</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Hey, Larry? How soon can you get to the Hyatt?</p>
<p>My dong fell out. Some woman saw it.</p>
<p>Well, goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: All right, calm down, calm down.</p>
<p>Everybody take it easy, everybody take a deep breath.</p>
<p>You know, we're gonna get through this.</p>
<p>I think, look, Kate, you two are clearly a little in over your heads here.</p>
<p>Right? Yeah. You're never gonna be able to rein in this particular group, so I tell you what.</p>
<p>I have some experience running, uh, little educational seminars like this, so why don't I take over for a little bit.</p>
<p>You guys, scoot. All right? On your bikes.</p>
<p>Here's a statistic for you: 100% of men are capable of being sexual harassers.</p>
<p>And 100% of women are capable of being sexually harassed.</p>
<p>Now, am I saying that all men are sexual harassers? No, no, no, no. No, no.</p>
<p>Of course not. No. Absolutely not. No.</p>
<p>Yes, some men are, uh, well, they're-they're sexual harassers, but they don't represent all men, you know, just like all women aren't represented by a few bad ones, you know. Women like, uh...</p>
<p>( <em>dramatic music plays</em> )</p>
<p>You know, and of course...</p>
<p>And then we got...</p>
<p>Point is, that gender really doesn't have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>There's really only one thing that determines whether a person will be accused of sexual harassment, and that is... ugliness.</p>
<p>( <em>all gasping</em> )</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Now, see, here's a, here's a graph of ugliness as it relates to time.</p>
<p>Now you see how the, how the arrow plunges pretty steeply downward as your ugliness increases.</p>
<p>Now I want you to imagine a scenario for me where this man walks into work one day, sees a woman, and says, "I like your dress."</p>
<p>Oh. Mildly sexual, but innocuous enough, yeah.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same sentence spoken by this man.</p>
<p>( <em>groans, gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you're very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We're all uncomfortable just looking at him now.</p>
<p>Because he's gross, he's ugly, he's a little bit of a monster.</p>
<p>Now is it this man's fault that he looks this way?</p>
<p>No. He was, he was born this way, but the point is, I know it's not my fault, you know. Is it your fault? I don't think so.</p>
<p>It's certainly not the woman's fault, you know?</p>
<p>The point is, know your place, monster man. Your time's up.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what you're thinking.</p>
<p>You're thinking, "How do I know if I'm ugly?</p>
<p>Well, if you're not sure, probably best to assume that you are.</p>
<p>Everyone in this room is. I-I did a scan.</p>
<p>Now here's the part where you say, "But, Dennis, I can't be ugly, I'm rich."</p>
<p>And, yes, money can offset and reduce ugliness, but it actually increases your risk.</p>
<p>You see, a construction worker, he can can catcall women all day long, right? And he gets away with it 'cause nobody gives a shit, but a rich guy...</p>
<p>A rich guy's fun to take down.</p>
<p>( <em>clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>Time's up.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>"But, Dennis," you're saying, "I can't be ugly, and-and it doesn't matter because I'm gay."</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Well, guess what, pal?</p>
<p>You-you are ugly, and it doesn't matter how much you work out. It's never gonna change that fact.</p>
<p>You've also objectified tons of men, including me.</p>
<p>You know, you got to stop kissing me, man.</p>
<p>I don't want it. I don't want you touching me at all.</p>
<p>Okay, it's never gonna happen. All right?</p>
<p>Not willingly. Your time's up.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>"But, Dennis, I can't be ugly. I'm a hopeless romantic."</p>
<p>( <em>clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>But no, you're-you're not.</p>
<p>Okay, you're-you're a sad, pathetic wretch of a man, so desperate to be loved that you'll actually go rifling through somebody's garbage.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ): And there's nothing...</p>
<p><em>nothing</em> more unattractive than desperation.</p>
<p>To... No, not him.</p>
<p>No, talking about you. No.</p>
<p>Not him, either. Yeah, I am talking about you. You know what, never mind. Your time's up.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>"But Dennis...</p>
<p>"I-I... see, I can't be ugly, all right?</p>
<p>I'm a woman."</p>
<p>( <em>clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>Well, no, women can be ugly, and you are one of them.</p>
<p>One of the ugly ones. You're lanky, and your hair's... well, it looks like a wig. Yeah. What's going on?</p>
<p>Is it a wig? Doesn't matter. Your time's up.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>But guys, I got some good news for you.</p>
<p>Okay? It's not a crime to be ugly.</p>
<p>But you can't be ugly and sloppy.</p>
<p>So, take me, for example.</p>
<p>I'm neither. Yeah, you see that?</p>
<p>That is 11% body fat. Now, the only place you're gonna...</p>
<p>What year was that photo taken?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Not taking questions right now, Mac.</p>
<p>So just... Yeah.</p>
<p>Point is, I keep my body tight.</p>
<p>But I also keep my life tight.</p>
<p>I got the tapes. I got the receipts.</p>
<p>They're all time-stamped and coded.</p>
<p>After every encounter, I received a text confirming each partner's consent and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask, "Well... would a woman really-really text that, Dennis?"</p>
<p>Their phones did.</p>
<p>I got the documents to prove it, so don't try coming at me.</p>
<p>But some of you... you just haven't been careful enough.</p>
<p>So you're asking yourself, "What can I do to save myself now?"</p>
<p>You got to clean up your act. Otherwise, you're going down, and you're gonna take me down with you, and I ain't going down.</p>
<p>You understand? I've been telling you this for years, but you refused to listen.</p>
<p>And so that's why I had to find a way to make you listen, which is why <em>I</em> created the Shitty Bar List.</p>
<p>( <em>crowd murmuring</em> )</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I made the spreadsheet, I posted it online, and I even hired these two bozos to host the seminar.</p>
<p>Wait, <em>you</em> hired us?</p>
<p>You're a monster.</p>
<p>( <em>clock ticking</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Prove it.</p>
<p>( <em>bell dings</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, wow! I feel like we should clap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was pretty good.</p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm gonna be honest, I didn't follow most of it, but so cool, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty drastic move to publicly expose us, but I see why you did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's true. I mean, women are out to get us.</p>
<p>Well, well, no, no. Women are right.</p>
<p>I mean, men are monsters. We're constantly harassing them.</p>
<p>I'm just saying we need to be more careful so we don't get accused.</p>
<p>And we should probably stop harassing them.</p>
<p>Uh, well, you know, I don't know. One step at a time.</p>
<p>We don't want the whole system to collapse, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Ease-ease into it.</p>
<p>It'd be chaotic. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Ease into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. You guys want to go grab some margaritas by the pool?</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Booze.</p>
<p>I'm ready for some booze.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>( <em>all laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, "MeToo."</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Very good, and for a woman, a good joke.</p>
<p>Hey, you guys think that Alan guy's got a big dick?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>I saw it in the bathroom. I sought it out.</p>
