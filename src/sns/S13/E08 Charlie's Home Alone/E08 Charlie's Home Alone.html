<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: <em>Where is it? It was right here.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot find it. And by the way, Mac, what're you even talking about?</em></p>
<p>The word is superstition, not "stupid-stition."</p>
<p>I know what the word is, Charlie.</p>
<p>I'm saying your green man suit is a stupid superstition.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Then why do the Eagles keep winning?</p>
<p>Also, by the way, dude, uh, you're a Cowboys fan, so shut the hell up.</p>
<p>I'm not a Cowboy fan, I'm a Tony Romo fan.</p>
<p>And he retired, so now I bleed green.</p>
<p>Go, Birds! Go, Birds!</p>
<p>All right, well, I'm not going to the Super Bowl without it. I got to find it.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't make us late, Charlie, all right?</p>
<p>I-If you can't find it, you can't find it, you know?</p>
<p>The-the fans have no effect on the outcome of the game, anyway.</p>
<p>Do you know how football works?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>That's right, your voodoo bullshit is not gonna mean anything if...</p>
<p>Wh-What's going on with your eye?</p>
<p>Uh, nothing, I got a, I think I got an eyelash in it.</p>
<p>Well, you're, like, scratching it, and it's blinking.</p>
<p>I just, I slept on it funny.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie groans</em> )</p>
<p>What the hell is the holdup here?</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Frank, this is why I wanted total control over the guest list, all right?</p>
<p>The eyes of the world are gonna be on Philadelphia, and I want to show them that we are not just degenerates, okay?</p>
<p>And that is why I'm very nervous about these guys.</p>
<p><strong>Men ( <em>chanting</em> )</strong>: Chug! Chug! Chug!</p>
<p>Chug! Chug! Chug!</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Chug! Oh!</p>
<p>Do me a favor, hold that corner right there.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Uh, I got to put up a sign.</p>
<p>I want people to know we're closed for salmonella because of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Okay. First of all, how is "salmonella" the only word you spelled correctly?</p>
<p>And second of all, which is it? Are we closed for salmonella, or are we closed 'cause of the Super Bowl? It's very confusing.</p>
<p>Look, do me a favor? Okay? Just go find green man.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Please? Please, thank you.</p>
<p>Charlie. Here, eat this asparagus.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, I can't eat that right now. That-That's not right.</p>
<p>It's not part of my rituals.</p>
<p>Okay, do you know what's not right... is that we are trying to start a family, and you're not taking it very seriously.</p>
<p>Okay, no, I hear you, but what I need to take seriously right now is the Super Bowl, okay?</p>
<p>And that means sticking to my color system.</p>
<p>All right? I <em>wear</em> green. I don't eat it.</p>
<p>I'm green man. I eat brown, preferably, uh, milksteak with a little light char to it.</p>
<p>And I drink yellow, because beer is yellow, and that is what has been working all season long!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about this right now.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where're you going?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Got to find green man.</p>
<p>Why does no one understand this?</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Nobody cares about your stupid superstitions.</p>
<p>Dude, just get off my back, all right? Let me find it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Man, look, I just wish one time you would not make everything so difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know what?</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish you'd just disappear.</p>
