<p><em>Let us gather. Please, gather for me.</em></p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>We're gathered.</p>
<p>Okay, so, now that you've gathered, I know that a lot has been on your minds these last couple weeks since I've been back.</p>
<p>Burning questions about my personal life, yeah.</p>
<p>I was gone. Now I'm back.</p>
<p>That's been confusing for you. It's been overwhelming.</p>
<p>The whole thing has been overwhelming for you.</p>
<p>And you've danced around the topic for a while now out of respect for my privacy.</p>
<p>And I-I really do appreciate that, but I would like for you all to know that I am ready now, and I think it's time to open it up to questions.</p>
<p>Now, don't hold back, guys. You can ask me anything.</p>
<p>Really. All those questions that you've got for me about what's going on, go ahead and ask them to me now.</p>
<p>You want to ask me if I'm gonna stay or if I'm gonna go.</p>
<p>I don't care. Do you care?</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn't really...</p>
<p>I may go back. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So, you guys want to ask me questions about my family.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, listen, sometimes it's best to raise a family from a distance.</p>
<p>And that's what I've decided to do, okay?</p>
<p>And I'm not the first man in history to ever do it.</p>
<p>All right, dude.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>Okay, so, if we're gonna sit here, and you guys are gonna insist on asking me personal questions, then be serious.</p>
<p>All right? L-Look, look, so, if all of you are done with your stupid questions, okay, then I have a question to ask.</p>
<p>I want to know, where is it?</p>
<p>Where's what?</p>
<p>Where's what? Where's what?</p>
<p>Where's my car, man?</p>
<p>Where's my Range Rover?</p>
<p>I'm sure you guys, like, stashed it somewhere safely, you know, in my absence. And that's cool. I get it.</p>
<p>But now I want it back, so where-where is it?</p>
<p>We didn't move you car. It's right where you left it.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>♪ ♪</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) I got to tell you, guys, that Range Rover, that was... that was like a part of me.</p>
<p>You know, I considered it part of my identity, really.</p>
<p>So it's-it's almost like a piece of me is gone now.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys wouldn't really understand 'cause you've never owned a vehicle.</p>
<p>We own vehicles.</p>
<p>Yeah? Name one.</p>
<p>Well, we had those matching Mongoose bikes back in the day.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I felt like a piece of me was gone when they got stolen.</p>
<p>Oh, that's right.</p>
<p>So it's not like I can't relate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dude, I wonder if they have bikes around here.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>They don't have bikes.</p>
<p>What are...?</p>
<p>She's a beaut, right?</p>
<p>How can I help?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, she's cool. She's cool.</p>
<p>Sort of lacks the original's, uh, masculinity and beefiness, you know, but there's a grace to it that I-I think I could probably work with.</p>
<p>That being said, do you guys have any '93 models?</p>
<p>We don't keep anything before 2015 on the lot.</p>
<p>Oh. Well, that sucks.</p>
<p>Uh, well, I'll take... I'll take this one, then.</p>
<p>Uh, it's-it's great, and I'm gonna drive it straight out of the showroom.</p>
<p>So go ahead and open up those big doors or however the hell you get these cars in there.</p>
<p>Open those up.</p>
<p>Well, sir, we need to talk financing first.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) Come on.</p>
<p>Yes, yes. Um, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Here-Here's my guy here. You're gonna want to talk to him about financing.</p>
<p>You never bought me a Range Rover.</p>
<p>All I got were shit cars, which you guys crashed, and you certainly never reimbursed me.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, quit your squawking, Dee.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, Frank, this guy needs to talk financing.</p>
<p>This is the one I'm gonna get here.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Very nice. Here you go, Dennis.</p>
<p>( <em>Dee scoffs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>That's for you.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, what is this, Frank?</p>
<p>That's $473.</p>
<p>That's the Kelley Blue Book value of your car.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ): Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, that-that's not gonna be nearly enough to pay-pay for the down payment on this, on this car here, so...</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Uh, is it?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Come on, man. What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Why did you do this?</p>
<p>I came here to buy myself a Range Rover.</p>
<p>In fact, that's the one I'd like.</p>
<p>It's a beauty. Look at that.</p>
<p>Hmm. Yeah.</p>
<p>And-and I'm gonna pay full price, so take it out of there, please.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. Yeah.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>That's right. It feels so good.</p>
<p>I haven't bought myself a new car in ages.</p>
<p>I just need to see a driver's license.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>I got it. Right here. Absolutely.</p>
<p>There you are. ( <em>sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Uh, sir, I'm afraid I can't sell you this vehicle, either.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Your driver's license is expired.</p>
<p>Since when?</p>
<p><strong>Salesman</strong>: 1984.</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Dork.</p>
<p>( <em>Mac and Charlie laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Jump this manhole.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Oh, still got the skid.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Radical.</p>
<p>Bro, bro, I feel like a carefree, young kid on a bike again, man. World at my fingertips.</p>
<p>Yeah! Me, too.</p>
<p>( <em>Charlie whoops</em> )</p>
<p>Why did we stop riding these things in the first place?</p>
<p>You don't remember?</p>
<p>Dude, Shawn Dumont and their buddies, they stole our bikes.</p>
<p>Shawn Dumont. That's right.</p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you remember what he said to us when we went back to get them?</p>
<p>"What are you gonna do about it?"</p>
<p>What are you gonna do about it. And what can you say to that?</p>
<p>That's, like, the perfect line.</p>
<p>Yeah! Well, you just got to walk away, 'cause it's the end of the conversation.</p>
<p>It ends all conversations.</p>
<p>( <em>sighs</em> ) You know, I'm starting to think that Dennis was right.</p>
<p>It's like what you ride is your identity.</p>
<p>It-It's like who you are. It's like, this, this feels like who I am.</p>
<p>And so Shawn Dumont didn't just steal our bikes.</p>
<p>He stole our identity.</p>
<p><strong>Boy</strong>: Cool bikes.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks, man. Uh... your bike's really cool, too.</p>
<p>I know it is.</p>
<p>You guys look like you're 40.</p>
<p>Well, we are 40.</p>
<p>Do you have the same bike as your boyfriend? Gay!</p>
<p>Oh, well, well, I am gay, but he's not my boyfriend, 'cause I could do much better than him.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>Then why don't you, Mac?</p>
<p>It's difficult out there.</p>
<p>You guys will understand when you get older.</p>
<p>Oh, don't push your agenda on them.</p>
<p>I'm not pushing an agenda. I'm just saying statistically at least one of them...</p>
<p>You guys suck.</p>
<p>Ah, that's...</p>
<p>That's... Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, look, we don't mean to bug you.</p>
<p>We'll-we'll be on our way.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don't want any trouble.</p>
<p>So, uh, Mac, find a hole.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!</p>
<p>Sorry. Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Go. Go. Go, Charlie, go!</p>
<p>Hey-ho. Look alive.</p>
<p>Snuck up on you there, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, she's quiet. She's quiet.</p>
<p>But that's a virtue. Stealth. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, personally, I never saw myself in an economy car, but I got to tell you, it's got its advantages. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I've been gone for a while.</p>
<p>I'm sure you noticed.</p>
<p>But now I'm back on the scene, you know? Doing my rounds.</p>
<p>See where the housewives are posted up. Have a good time.</p>
<p>You know, do me a favor, keep it out front for me, because I don't think I'm gonna... Oh.</p>
<p>Probably doesn't speak English.</p>
<p>( <em>horn honks</em> )</p>
<p>Hey-ho.</p>
<p>What up, ding-dong?</p>
<p>Whoa, what is this? W-What am I seeing?</p>
<p>Oh, what, you like my new beast?</p>
<p>How are you in this car?</p>
<p>Well, it's Frank's car.</p>
<p>But, uh, until he gets his license back, it's mine. I'm gonna drive it.</p>
<p>I just got to drop him off where he needs to go.</p>
<p>Just dropped him off at driver's ed.</p>
<p>And I got to tell you, Dennis.</p>
<p>I get why you want to be a Range Rover man.</p>
<p>You know, it's kind of like you're up on a throne, a-and you-you're looking down on all the minions, you know?</p>
<p>Very powerful. Yeah. Oh.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Thank you. You just, uh, keep it out front.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Don't bother. He doesn't speak English.</p>
<p>Of course, ma'am.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>No, I mean, he didn't spe... He doesn't, um...</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I'm-I'm saying he doesn't, I'm saying he...</p>
<p>What were you saying?</p>
<p>He doesn't always speak English.</p>
<p>Sometimes he's... I come here a lot, so, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, anyway, you want to hear something that's really cool?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I drove all the way here and barely used an ounce of gas.</p>
<p>Now, that is both economically and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Is that the 2018?</p>
<p>Oh, it most certainly is.</p>
<p>I was just telling my friend Brenda here that she needs to upgrade.</p>
<p>She is still driving a 2013.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Oh. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Are you loving it? I mean, just loving it?</p>
<p>I tell you what, I am loving it. And Brenda, you got to upgrade, you stupid bitch. Okay? Don't be a dumb idiot.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>both laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, you are fun.</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Would you like to join us for lunch?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh, you know, ladies, you know, while we're on the subject of cars, um, I actually drove here in a Prius today...</p>
<p>Oh, so you don't have a Range Rover.</p>
<p>Uh, well, no.</p>
<p>I just said I have a Prius...</p>
<p>No? Okay.</p>
<p>Then why are we talking to you? ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>women laugh</em> )</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> ): Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>So when you come to a four-way stop, who has the right of way?</p>
<p>Okay, what you want to do is, you want to lurch into the intersection.</p>
<p>It's like, kind of like a game of chicken.</p>
<p>You lurch, and then you lurch, you lurch some more, and whoever doesn't flinch gets to go first.</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds, if you would just look at the book.</p>
<p>Well, e-excuse me, in all due respect, but this book does not have the real rules of the road in here.</p>
<p>There's nothing in this book about the Asians.</p>
<p>( <em>students gasp</em> )</p>
<p>You can't be PC on the road and expect to live.</p>
<p>You will die.</p>
<p>You go to a four-way stop, and you think the rules of the road are going to apply to an 80-year-old Asian woman, you're going to get blasted.</p>
<p>( <em>school bell rings</em> )</p>
<p>Right. Well, we are out of time for today. I urge you all to study what's in the book and not listen to this man here.</p>
<p>Bruh, that shit was hilarious.</p>
<p>You're gonna fail so hard, man.</p>
<p>I can't afford to fail. I ca...</p>
<p>You mind if I cheat off you?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What's in it for me?</p>
<p>I'll buy you a case of beer.</p>
<p>Nah, I never get carded.</p>
<p>Cigs? Weed? Blow?</p>
<p>Nah, I'm in high school, man. I can get all that shit.</p>
<p>How about porno? Yeah.</p>
<p>porno?</p>
<p>Dude, I've got a phone.</p>
<p>I've been looking at porno since I was, like, ten.</p>
<p>No, I'm talking about the real thing.</p>
<p>The real shit?</p>
<p>Yeah, the real deal.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>( <em>car door opens</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, man.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>Wha-What are you doing?</p>
<p>Oh. I'm John. Aren't you my Uber?</p>
<p>Am-am I your Uber? No, I...</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Okay.</p>
<p>( <em>laughing</em> ): Yeah, I think I see what's happening here.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, I'm-I'm not your Uber, I'm not your ride.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> ): Oh, God.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so why don't you... um, why don't you get out?</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, man.</p>
<p>( <em>chuckles</em> ) Nice car, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, no, it is a...</p>
<p>It is a nice car, isn't it? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Not at all. It's very sensible.</p>
<p>I Uber 'cause I drive this old piece of shit that gets no mileage, so...</p>
<p>Ah. Yeah. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Hey, John, was it?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>That's a strong economy name.</p>
<p>You know, it says so much, yet it says so little.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got a good economy face on you, too.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Eh.</p>
<p>Hey, man, I got to get going.</p>
<p>I have some friends from my fantasy league coming over, so I should find my ride.</p>
<p>Hey, I like sports, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do, but I've never really engaged with the fantasy element of it.</p>
<p>No? Oh, it's the best.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And daily fantasy makes every game matter.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>You get way more bang for your buck.</p>
<p>Ah. Well, that's economical.</p>
<p>I... You know what? That makes total sense.</p>
<p>I think I'm, I think I'm starting to understand now.</p>
<p>It always seemed foolish to me before, but this economy car has got me thinking I could enjoy economy activities.</p>
<p>You know what, John. Cancel your ride.</p>
<p>I'll drive you to your fantasy.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Aw, dude, when was the last time we bought baseball cards, man?</p>
<p>I don't know, but it's fun, dude, and it's also, like, a great investment, right?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I got a Chuck Knoblauch!</p>
<p>That's, like, pre-yips, man.</p>
<p>Pre-yips?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That could be worth a fortune!</p>
<p>Yeah, it's gonna be worth a lot, man. He was good.</p>
<p>Goddamn.</p>
<p>See, this is what I feel like we missed out on.</p>
<p>Like-like our whole lives could've been different if those bikes weren't stolen, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Wait. Where's your bike?</p>
<p>Ah, shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, bro, I don't know if I'm down for whatever you got planned out here.</p>
<p>I mean...</p>
<p>No, no. Here you go.</p>
<p>What the hell is...?</p>
<p>This is, this is it.</p>
<p>This is it. This is it. This is where I kept it.</p>
<p>Check this out. Huh?</p>
<p>Check this out. <em>Trésor.</em></p>
<p>Check this out. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Trésor?</em></p>
<p>Look at this. Look at that.</p>
<p><em>Skank.</em> Hold on to that.</p>
<p>Look at this. <em>Score.</em></p>
<p>Okay, but...</p>
<p>Look at it. This is...</p>
<p>Brah, I-I thought, I thought you was gonna get me laid, all right?</p>
<p>That would have been lit.</p>
<p>Huh? Well, this is just...</p>
<p>This shit's just weird as hell.</p>
<p>Well, no...</p>
<p>I mean, the plastic bags? Come on, man.</p>
<p>Well, the...</p>
<p>Look, my-my boy Dennis is tight with the girls.</p>
<p>He's gonna get you laid, but you got to help me pass that test.</p>
<p>Here, check this out. Look at that. Ooh!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Hey, hey. No, no.</p>
<p>Huh? That's nice. Wait, wait.</p>
<p>Hold that up. I want to get it for my Instagram story.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was good. That was good. Here you go, here you go.</p>
<p>Check this out. ho!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>This shit's weird as hell, man.</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>( <em>relaxing music playing</em> )</p>
<p>I mean, sure, it feels a little fast.</p>
<p>And at first I thought it was 'cause I had the newest model, but that's not it.</p>
<p>They recognize me for who I really am.</p>
<p>You know, my true identity.</p>
<p>They, uh, invited me to Turks and Caicos for Karen's birthday on a private jet. ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>That's when I was like, "Okay, well, which one is it?</p>
<p>Turks or Caicos? 'Cause I'm not invited back on Caicos."</p>
<p>( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Why aren't you laughing?</p>
<p>No. Well, you probably don't speak English.</p>
<p>I speak English. It's just not funny.</p>
<p>( <em>women laughing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Deandra, that massage was everything.</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>Ah. We deserve it.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>At least I do.</p>
<p>I just wish my second husband came with a dimmer switch.</p>
<p>I forgot how much energy men in their 20s have.</p>
<p>Oh. ( <em>chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Karen upgraded. Her first husband was, like, 70.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Now she's got a boy toy with five percent body fat. Yum.</p>
<p>Karen, you dog.</p>
<p>But his brain is the size of a pea, so conversations are like pulling teeth.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about these things 'cause you've never been married.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>The fuck is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Oh, Karen, you bitch.</p>
<p>You dumb idiot. You stupid savage.</p>
<p>You're not the alpha here, you crusty-ass fool.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm gonna cuck you so hard.</p>
<p>Your boy toy... he's mine.</p>
<p>I will destroy you.</p>
<p>I am a 2018 Range Rover woman.</p>
<p>I am a golden goddess.</p>
<p>Who are you, idiot?</p>
<p>Savage!</p>
<p>( <em>echoes</em> ): Idiot!</p>
<p>Yo, yo, Den dog, we're here. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: ( <em>chuckles</em> ) Hey, Frankie.</p>
<p>Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p>What's up? Hey.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks for inviting us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, listen, everybody, this is my friend Frank and his, uh... friend. His-his, uh...</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>...young friend.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting us. Yeah.</p>
<p>Make yourself at home.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey. Uh, what do you think, guys? It's pretty great, right?</p>
<p>John's got a pretty nice setup.</p>
<p>You know, he's got great Wi-Fi, too, which is great for playing fantasy sports.</p>
<p>We're-we're doing a little fantasy baseball right now.</p>
<p>Is this the dude you're talking about?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. Mm, yeah.</p>
<p>Don't embarrass me, man.</p>
<p>I'm not embarrassing you.</p>
<p>Dennis.</p>
<p>This place is weak, bro.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Bro.</p>
<p>It's not... no, not weak.</p>
<p>( <em>Frank laughs</em> )</p>
<p>Who is...? Yeah. Not weak, guy.</p>
<p>You know, these guys, they-they totally get it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? Hey, look.</p>
<p>They work hard, but they play hard, you know.</p>
<p>They play fantasy hard, too.</p>
<p>Yeah. I really want to show you this lineup I...</p>
<p>( <em>stammers</em> ) Dennis?</p>
<p>At least hit on the one chick that's here.</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, no. That's-that's Tara, and I think, uh...</p>
<p>I think John's got a little bit of a thing for her, so...</p>
<p>You lose your mojo?</p>
<p>( <em>scoffs</em> ) I didn't lose my mojo.</p>
<p>I still got my...</p>
<p>Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>You got the moves?</p>
<p>I got my mojo.</p>
<p>I said you-you...</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Uh, Insta story.</p>
<p>Kids.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>( <em>groans</em> ) What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Aidan</strong>: It's video, bro.</p>
<p>Uh, okay. What do I do? Like, should I do, like, a thing, or...?</p>
<p><strong>Aidan</strong>: Oh, this dude sucks.</p>
<p>What are you doing, man? I don't suck. Dude, I'll suck you.</p>
<p>You'll suck me? ( <em>laughs</em> )</p>
<p>No, that's...</p>
<p>That's not what I meant.</p>
<p>Oh, that's perfect, man.</p>
<p>What are you, what are you gonna do with that, dude?</p>
<p>Don't put that out in the world.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Go hit on the girl, will you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'll show you what sucks, huh?</p>
<p>Let's go. Let's see it.</p>
<p>I'll hit on Tara, man. You'll see.</p>
<p>I want to watch. Let's go.</p>
<p>Who is this guy?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come watch this. Watch this.</p>
<p>All right. All right.</p>
<p>Yo.</p>
