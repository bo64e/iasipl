<p>What the shit is this?</p>
<p>Uh, Cheech over here bought himself a bong.</p>
<p>Deandra, this is wacky.</p>
<p>Go download me a hoagie off the Internet.</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>Those words don't make any s- sense.</p>
<p>Oh, God, you guys.</p>
<p>Oh, weird, I feel weird.</p>
<p>Rip another one.</p>
<p>Yeah, say something else stupid, too.</p>
<p>My arm's kind of numb.</p>
<p>Dennis, can you feel my head? Am I hot?</p>
<p>I'm not touching you.</p>
<p>We're enjoying ourselves over here.</p>
<p>I'm serious, you guys.</p>
<p>Something's not right.</p>
<p>There's pigeons in the bar.</p>
<p>I feel...</p>
<p>Pigeons in the bar.</p>
<p>I'm being really serious, you guys, I need some he...</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>What is her problem?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>So... heart attack.</p>
<p>Yeah, yikes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.</p>
<p>And the EMT says basically I'm like a ticking time bomb at this point 'cause it was just a little one.</p>
<p>I didn't know women could have heart attacks.</p>
<p>You know, what's scary about this whole thing, really, is that I have the same genes as her.</p>
<p>I'm concerned for myself and Charlie as well.</p>
<p>We lead a very rock-and-roll lifestyle.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I just had a heart attack. Can we focus on me for two minutes here?</p>
<p>I feel like we did talk about you.</p>
<p>Dee, your ship has sailed.</p>
<p>Okay, it's time to move on to us, the people who are going to live on.</p>
<p>Guys, we got to make sure that this does not happen to us.</p>
<p>That's the important thing here.</p>
<p>We need to focus on ourselves...</p>
<p>Ms. Reynolds?</p>
<p>Doctor, thank God. Listen, let's just do all the tests you've got, okay?</p>
<p>I feel like the big one's right around the corner.</p>
<p>Well, actually, Ms. Reynolds, first we need to discuss how you'll be paying for your stay.</p>
<p>Paying?</p>
<p>This is a hospital.</p>
<p>Since when do you pay to stay in a hospital?</p>
<p>Since always.</p>
<p>Uh, no, I believe that is what taxes are for.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don't pay a fireman to put out a fire.</p>
<p>Or a cop to shoot a guy or...</p>
<p>How do you not know how this works?</p>
<p>You've been in a hospital before.</p>
<p>I guess I must have slipped through the cracks.</p>
<p>I do always give a fake name 'cause I like to stay off the grid.</p>
<p>They usually just give me a bunch of antibiotics, the sores go away, and I walk out.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Doctor, I have health insurance.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're on our father's policy.</p>
<p>You guys, check out this cool gown.</p>
<p>Really lets your ass breathe.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Why are you wearing that thing, dude?</p>
<p>I'm getting a full-body scan.</p>
<p>I've been partying real hard lately.</p>
<p>Whatever. She needs to see the insurance card.</p>
<p>I canceled that shit when you were nine.</p>
<p>You canceled our insurance policy?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What, am I gonna carry that burden around?</p>
<p>You couldn't have given us a heads-up about that a long time ago?</p>
<p>Okay, let me get this straight.</p>
<p>Ms. Reynolds, you have no health insurance?</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, get out.</p>
<p>Harsh.</p>
<p>Why is the government not providing us with health insurance?</p>
<p>I mean, what is this, like some kind of socialist country or some kind of communist dictatorship? This is insane, this is un American. You don't pay for health insurance. That's crazy.</p>
<p>All I know is we need to find insurance ASAP.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, we're going to get sick eventually.</p>
<p>So we just find a couple of side jobs, right?</p>
<p>That way we'll have insurance, and when disaster inevitably occurs, we'll be covered.</p>
<p>We'll be covered.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>"Position available.</p>
<p>Major sales corporation.</p>
<p>Motivated individuals.</p>
<p>Good interpersonal skills".</p>
<p>You don't have to say anymore.</p>
<p>That's us, that is us.</p>
<p>"Salary and benefits".</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Why are you still wearing that thing, dude?</p>
<p>Did you wear that all the way here?</p>
<p>I let my ass breathe.</p>
<p>You keep saying that, but I don't know what it means.</p>
<p>Yeah, how does an ass breathe?</p>
<p>Explain that to me.</p>
<p>How does a...?</p>
<p>Just leave me alone, okay?!</p>
<p>I can't get worked up.</p>
<p>My doctor told me not to get worked up.</p>
<p>I'm under too much stress.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>That's a lot of pills, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the beauty of having insurance.</p>
<p>You can get the top-quality anti-anxiety drug.</p>
<p>Wow, you got a lot of 'em, huh?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm taking 'em because I can't sift through the duds.</p>
<p>I got to take 'em all because I got to get healthy really fast.</p>
<p>You're taking 'em all at once?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't think that's a good idea.</p>
<p>It seems a bit aggressive to me.</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing!</p>
<p>Oh, this is great, Dee.</p>
<p>This is perfect.</p>
<p>I mean, getting in shape is like the best health insurance you can get.</p>
<p>Yeah, you take care of your body, you don't need a doctor. I want that.</p>
<p>That's exactly right, yeah.</p>
<p>You look good, you feel good.</p>
<p>It's all connected, baby.</p>
<p>It's connected. You're talking about the mind- body-abs connection.</p>
<p>I would personally like to get some side abs going.</p>
<p>You want to get some side abs?</p>
<p>That's a good idea. You know what I'm concerned about?</p>
<p>I don't want to get too bulky.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I want to stay nice and lean and tight.</p>
<p>I want to get that Jesus-on-the-cross look.</p>
<p>I think that crucifixion must have been really good for your core because...</p>
<p>Absolutely. Jesus had, like, the best abs. He had the right idea.</p>
<p>Hey, he knew: no pain, no gain.</p>
<p>He had good messages.</p>
<p>I'm sure he started that.</p>
<p>All right, well, let's do some cardio since we're here.</p>
<p>Yeah, here we are.</p>
<p>Let's, uh, let's get our blood pumping.</p>
<p>Let's hop on these treadmills and, uh, you know, let's do this thing.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm ready.</p>
<p>I'm not feeling ready.</p>
<p>Uh, I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>I feel a little low-energy.</p>
<p>That's what it is.</p>
<p>We need to fuel up.</p>
<p>Now, I see people utilizing a lot of shakes and powders around here.</p>
<p>We should probably look into that.</p>
<p>We should do that.</p>
<p>You know what else we should do?</p>
<p>Get some new outfits.</p>
<p>Let's get some new outfits.</p>
<p>That's a great idea.</p>
<p>You decided to rock jeans, for instance. I'm confused by that.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, I chose jeans. I'm not seeing a lot of other jeans...</p>
<p>I've never seen jeans in a gym.</p>
<p>Okay, well, look, that's fine.</p>
<p>This is what we'll do.</p>
<p>We'll dial it back.</p>
<p>We'll get fueled up, we'll get some sick new outfits, and then we'll come back and work out.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>"Official resum√© of Mac and Charlie".</p>
<p>So both of you are...</p>
<p>Well, gentlemen, I've never seen two people share a resume before.</p>
<p>Well, we thought we'd save paper.</p>
<p>You know, go green.</p>
<p>Uh, "Work experience: Paddy's Pub management"?</p>
<p>And duties that include "ordering supplies and taking care of business".</p>
<p>T.C.O.B.</p>
<p>Uh, "Business coordinator for several year"... I don't know who this is.</p>
<p>Coordinator.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>"For several years, I've been in complete charge of pretty much everything in my life."</p>
<p>I don't miss a beat.</p>
<p>That would actually be him.</p>
<p>Uh, not... pretty much everything.</p>
<p>There's certain things that you just can't have control of, sir.</p>
<p>I think you'll find that what we lack in formal education, we more than make up for in street smarts.</p>
<p>Okay, so we can wheel, we can deal, we can oversee hostile takeovers.</p>
<p>Whatever you need, bud.</p>
<p>You name it.</p>
<p>It's a mailroom gig, and there's only one spot available.</p>
<p>Kind of a package deal.</p>
<p>We sort of work as a team.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>What if we split the pay right down the middle?</p>
<p>You'd be willing to do that?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, this has nothing to do with money.</p>
<p>This is sort of a health insurance situation for us...</p>
<p>...so, you know, frankly, you don't even really have to pay us at all.</p>
<p>Legally, I have to pay you something, but, uh, minimum wage maybe?</p>
<p>Minimum wage?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>That's great.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That's a government salary right there, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p>The job is both of yours.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>Congratulations to you.</p>
<p>Bro.</p>
<p>Minimum wage.</p>
<p>Minimum wage.</p>
<p>Fat burner?</p>
<p>Well, I'm already on a nitric oxide energy stack, but yeah, sure, I'll take some fat burner... why not?</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>Before we begin today, are there any physical ailments that I should know about first?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I just had a heart attack.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>I just had a heart attack. Maybe you should turn this techno music down.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got to be honest, buddy, I'm not really feeling these tunes.</p>
<p>Boom, there we go.</p>
<p>Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm rifling through your music, and it's pretty terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what, put it down.</p>
<p>Does he have any '80s?</p>
<p>Doesn't appear to.</p>
<p>No, it seems like he's got a bunch of goddamn dance mixes.</p>
<p>Hang on. It's all good.</p>
<p>I got a Steve Winwood CD in my car.</p>
<p>I'll just go out and grab that.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, don't do that.</p>
<p>Please don't do that.</p>
<p>Why, what's wrong with Steve Winwood?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, "Higher Love"?</p>
<p>It's a classic.</p>
<p>Listen, I pick the music in this class, okay?</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>I had no idea that this was all about you.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't think you should even be here if you just had a heart attack, ma'am.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you shouldn't dress like a bumblebee, bitch.</p>
<p>You just dogged, bro.</p>
<p>You just got dogged.</p>
<p>Guys, please leave my class.</p>
<p>Spin class.</p>
<p>A bunch of hamsters on a wheel.</p>
<p>I'm gonna ride a bike hard, I'm gonna ride a bike fast and oh, yeah, I'm not gonna go anywhere.</p>
<p>And then when I walk out, I'm gonna put a bunch of metal onto a metal bar and lift that metal over and over like a metal jerk.</p>
<p>You know, I got to be honest with you.</p>
<p>I feel like these supplements are doing a great job on their own, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I've got tons of energy.</p>
<p>My heart rate's up.</p>
<p>Things are going great.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I feel good, too.</p>
<p>Look how vascular I am.</p>
<p>Look at how my veins are popping.</p>
<p>I look good, and I feel good.</p>
<p>I feel good, too, apart from the recent bouts of explosive diarrhea.</p>
<p>Been having diarrhea?</p>
<p>Oh, God, all over the place.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You know what that is?</p>
<p>That's probably your body flushing out all the toxins.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>I do think so.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, have not taken a shit in days.</p>
<p>Days?</p>
<p>Days.</p>
<p>That doesn't sound good.</p>
<p>Oh, no, it's good.</p>
<p>My body's working at 100% efficiency, yeah.</p>
<p>My body is absorbing every single nutrient, and it's not wasting a single thing.</p>
<p>Your body's taking its job very seriously.</p>
<p>My body is doing its job like it's never done before.</p>
<p>Okay, we're gonna start climbing just a little more.</p>
<p>30% more resistance.</p>
<p>Why don't we up the supplements, which we know work, and eliminate working out, which we know blows?</p>
<p>That sounds like a pretty good plan.</p>
<p>You know what, I'm gonna take it one step further and propose that we start working on a muscle that we've been neglecting this entire time.</p>
<p>And it's the most important muscle in the entire body.</p>
<p>Which muscle?</p>
<p>The face.</p>
<p>That's a gift for you, bumblebee.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Enjoy it, Coach dick and Balls.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor whose grandpa was a sailor.</p>
<p>There you go, Mr. Scott who drinks his coffee hot.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Mr. White whose wife is not too bright, there you go.</p>
<p>Come on, dude, I'm trying to network by the water cooler.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I'm doing both of our jobs here, so you want to help out?</p>
<p>Okay, the mail doesn't stop down there, Mac.</p>
<p>I need help.</p>
<p>All right, this is Felix's pile.</p>
<p>He receives for Eric.</p>
<p>He receives for Janet.</p>
<p>Don't ever look Janet in the eye because she's a horrible devil woman.</p>
<p>I feel like you are taking this shit way too seriously.</p>

<p>Will you just help me out, man?</p>
<p>This is Johnson's mail, okay?</p>
<p>Now, Johnson's gone AWOL for the week with the wife and kids down in Orlando, so I want you to keep a pile in a neat stack somewhere that's all Johnson's mail.</p>
<p>Oh, wait a second.</p>
<p>This guy's in Orlando for the week?</p>
<p>Yeah, man, come on, help me out here.</p>
<p>Oh, hold on a second, bro.</p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm gonna hang out in his office and pretend I'm the new guy.</p>
<p>I don't think that's gonna work, dude.</p>
<p>Have you seen The Secret of My Success?</p>
<p>They're gonna catch on to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, but before they do, I will come up with an idea that will save the company millions, and they'll be forced to promote me.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>How does that movie end, dude?</p>
<p>I can't rember.</p>
<p>He bangs that old lady, and then they play that song from the '80s.</p>
<p>"Day Bow Bow."</p>
<p>What the hell is "Day Bow Bow"?</p>
<p>No, Mac, seriously...</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>At least give him his mail.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude, what's going on in here?</p>
<p>I'm really behind the eight ball, Mac.</p>
<p>The mail doesn't stop, bud.</p>
<p>You're smoking now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm smoking now.</p>
<p>You kidding me?</p>
<p>My nerves are like...</p>
<p>So I'm trying to smoke.</p>
<p>I'm trying to calm myself down, and hey, we got insurance, so what the hell, I can smoke.</p>
<p>Maybe you're right 'cause I need to calm my nerves a bit, dude.</p>
<p>It's a shark tank up there.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, is it?</p>
<p>I bet.</p>
<p>Have some coffee, too.</p>
<p>That will calm you down.</p>
<p>What's your system here, bro?</p>
<p>It's pretty complicated.</p>
<p>The mail goes into three sections according to how important I think the thing looks, okay?</p>
<p>Now, the least important stuff, I'm gonna burn that.</p>
<p>If it's important, they're gonna send it again, right?</p>
<p>The middle important stuff, I put that back in the mail addressed to me so I buy myself a couple more days.</p>
<p>And the most important stuff, that gets delivered, although, you know something, Mac, I actually burn that, too, most of the time.</p>
<p>Okay, well, it looks like you've got this under control.</p>
<p>I'm gonna get back to my office.</p>
<p>All right, bud, all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm...</p>
<p>The mail doesn't stop!</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, buddy.</p>
<p>All right, I'm gonna get back to my office, and then...</p>
<p>You know, I'll see you later.</p>
<p>All right, man.</p>
<p>Okay, bud.</p>
<p>You're not gonna stop, are you?</p>
<p>Come on, man, hit me.</p>
<p>Come on, hit me again.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>I found him wandering the streets.</p>
<p>No ID, no nothing.</p>
<p>Figure we turn him over to you until someone claimed him.</p>
<p>Poor thing.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p>I think he crapped himself.</p>
<p>This way.</p>
<p>Right through here.</p>
<p>Hit me, hit me again.</p>
<p>Hit me.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><em>Who is this?</em></p>
<p>This is Mac.</p>
<p>I'm the new guy.</p>
<p><em>What are you doing in my office?</p>
<p>Who are you, and why are you in my office?</em></p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p><em>This is Johnson.</em></p>
<p>I thought you were in Orlando.</p>
<p><em>I am in Orlando. I'm trying to check my voicemail.</em></p>
<p>I can check it for you.</p>
<p><em>No, don't... just...</p>
<p>What is your name, sir?</em></p>
<p>Why don't you just give me your name?</p>
<p>Your full name, sir.</p>
<p>Oh, this is going to be great, sis.</p>
<p>I mean, we already got the mind, body and soul going.</p>
<p>Now all we need is to get our faces nice and tight, and we'll be healthy as all hell.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Now, you're clear on these instructions, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>You know what you're doing?</p>
<p>They're in Spanish.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know, if you know Latin, you know, like, three languages, so...</p>
<p>As far as I know, you don't speak Latin.</p>
<p>I don't speak Latin, but there's pictures in here, so I think we're good.</p>
<p>So you're good with the pictures then?</p>
<p>Can we get going with this, though?</p>
<p>'Cause those supplements are giving me the squirts like you would not believe.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I would kill for your bowel movements right now.</p>
<p>I am so blocked up.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do your eyes first, so hold really still.</p>
<p>Easy, easy.</p>
<p>Seriously, do not move.</p>
<p>It's in?</p>
<p>It's out.</p>
<p>It's out?</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>It's out, and it's in.</p>
<p>Pretty good, right?</p>
<p>Painless.</p>
<p>Great. Let's just let that settle for a minute, and I'll...</p>
<p>Think about what I would like to do.</p>
<p>Number one, I'd like to get rid of these crow's feet that I have been noticing coming in, which I do not appreciate.</p>
<p>And hear me out on this one.</p>
<p>It's a little weird.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about doing something to my earlobes.</p>
<p>I've never really liked my earlobes. Jesus!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>How's that eye feel?</p>
<p>Oh, it feels a little weird.</p>
<p>I'm having a little trouble seeing out of it.</p>
<p>That's normal, right?</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>It's not? Really?</p>
<p>God, now that you mention it, sis, I do feel a fair amount of pain coming on.</p>
<p>God, it stings.</p>
<p>shit, Dennis, I think maybe I switched these up.</p>
<p>You switched 'em up?</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm thinking...</p>
<p>What the hell!</p>
<p>Maybe I put some collagen in your eye.</p>
<p>You injected Mexican collagen in my eye?!</p>
<p>Sorry. I can't handle the stress you're giving me right now.</p>
<p>My heart is very weak.</p>
<p>It's a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>Oh, God, I think I'm going blind in one eye.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I feel very weird.</p>
<p>I'm going blind.</p>
<p>I feel like my heart might explode.</p>
<p>Are you feeling better today?</p>
<p>I like to hear that.</p>
<p>Now take your medication.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Hello, Chief.</p>
<p>They're onto me, dude.</p>
<p>Those guys are sharp as nails up there.</p>
<p>You can't put anything past them.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude, I'm freaking out.</p>
<p>I am so stressed out. I feel like I'm having a panic attack.</p>
<p>You want to talk about stress?</p>
<p>You want to talk about stress?!</p>
<p>Okay? I've stumbled onto a major company conspiracy, Mac.</p>
<p>How about that for stress?</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>This company is being bled like a stuck pig, Mac, and I got a paper trail to prove it.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Take a look at this.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Charlie.</p>
<p>That right there is the mail.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the mail.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the mail, please, Mac?</p>
<p>I've been dying to talk about the mail with you all day, okay?</p>
<p>Pepe Silvia... This name keeps coming up over and over again.</p>
<p>Every day, Pepe's mail's getting sent back to me.</p>
<p>I look in the mail.</p>
<p>This whole box is Pepe Silvia.</p>
<p>So, I say to myself, I got to find this guy.</p>
<p>I got to go up to his office.</p>
<p>I got to put his mail in the guy's goddamn hands.</p>
<p>Otherwise he's never gonna get it.</p>
<p>He's gonna keep coming back down here, so I go up to Pepe's office, and what do I find out? What do I find out?!</p>
<p>There is no Pepe Silvia.</p>
<p>The man does not exist, okay?</p>
<p>So, I decide, "Oh, shit, buddy.</p>
<p>I got to dig a little deeper."</p>
<p>There's no Pepe Silvia.</p>
<p>You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>I got boxes full of Pepe!</p>
<p>All right, so I start marching my way down to Carol in HR, and I knock on her door, and I say, "Carol, I got to talk to you about Pepe."</p>
<p>And when I open the door, what do I find?</p>
<p>There's not a single, goddamn desk in that office.</p>
<p>There is no Carol in HR.</p>
<p>Mac, half the employees in this building have been made up.</p>
<p>This office is a goddamn ghost town.</p>
<p>Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna have to stop you right there.</p>
<p>Not only do all of these people exist, but they have been asking for their mail on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It's all they're talking about up there.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude, we are going to lose our jobs.</p>
<p>Well, calm down, 'cause here's one thing that's not gonna happen.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We're not gonna get fired.</p>
<p>We're not?</p>
<p>'Cause we've already been fired.</p>
<p>We've lost our jobs?!</p>
<p>About three days ago, a couple of pink slips came in the mail.</p>
<p>One for you and one for me. So what did I do?</p>
<p>I mailed them halfway to Siberia, okay?</p>
<p>Charlie, if we've lost our jobs, that means we've lost our health insurance, which means all of this was for nothing.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, dude.</p>
<p>I'm having a panic attack.</p>
<p>I am actually having a panic attack.</p>
<p>Oh, will you settle down and have another cup of coffee?</p>
<p>I am, bro.</p>
<p>All right, well, fine.</p>
<p>You know what, Barney?</p>
<p>Give this guy a cigarette.</p>
<p>He's freaking out.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Barney. He's the guy who tipped me off to Pepe Silvia.</p>
<p>Barney?! Who the hell is Barney?!</p>
<p>You don't see Bar...?</p>
<p>Oh, shit, where the hell did he...?</p>
<p>You've lost your mind.</p>
<p>You've lost your goddamn mind, Charlie.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, dude, will you forget the mail, all right?</p>
<p>Forget the mail?</p>
<p>The mail's the most important thing in the world now.</p>
<p>Dude, you're gonna give me another panic attack.</p>
<p>You have a cigarette?</p>
<p>I hear Barney.</p>
<p>Where's Barney, huh?</p>
<p>How long is the wait at this place?!</p>
<p>We have been here for hours and hours.</p>
<p>Goddamn Frank.</p>
<p>Where the hell is he?</p>
<p>shit!</p>
<p>Where am I?</p>
<p>Tonto...</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Come on, bub, let's go.</p>
<p>Get up. You got to help me out here.</p>
<p>Pick this up and throw it through this window.</p>
<p>Pick... throw.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>One...</p>
<p>Two... and three.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>You go first.</p>
