<p>If there is anything I have learned from this godforsaken rock, it is that I never want to see any of you assholes ever again!</p>

<p>Get her, banshee.</p>
<p>I will speak at whatever volume I choose, and if you don't like it, you can suck my big fat dick!</p>
<p>One volume? For every single person in the whole wide world?</p>
<p>That's socialism, and I won't stand for it!</p>
<p>We should be able to speak at whatever volume we identify with!</p>
<p>Because that is the American way!</p>

<p>We are America, sweetheart!</p>

<p>Because we love her! And when you love someone, you can't bear to leave 'em behind!</p>
