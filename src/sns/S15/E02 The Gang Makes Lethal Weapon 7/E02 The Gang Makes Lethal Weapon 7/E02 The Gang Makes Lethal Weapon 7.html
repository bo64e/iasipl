<p>It's an outrage. It's un American is what it is.</p>
<p>I thought this was a free country.</p>
<p>Free. This is censorship. That's what it is.</p>
<p>What ever happened to free speech, huh?</p>
<p>You tell me that.</p>
<p>Frank, we're not inside your head, man.</p>
<p>We don't know what the hell you're talking about.</p>
<p>Lethal Weapon 5 and 6 are gone.</p>
<p>Huh? What do you mean they're gone?</p>
<p>They removed them from the library.</p>
<p>They got pulled?</p>
<p>Yeah. The lady said they took them down because of insensitivity.</p>
<p>Huh. Well, I'll be honest with you guys, I'm not sure how we, uh, talked the local library into displaying those movies in the first place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They were works of art.</p>
<p>Well, well, yeah, I mean, they would've been works of art had Mac not ruined them with his blackface.</p>
<p>Okay. Look, uh, my heart was in the right place, and I-I-I feel awful about it now.</p>
<p>Look, you never should've done it in the first place.</p>
<p>That was the whole point of the conversation we were having.</p>
<p>I told you not to do it, man.</p>
<p>I know, I know, but, look, I've done a lot of learning over the past year, as we all have.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>We've also done a lot of growing.</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>A lot of learning, a lot of growing, and a lot of being scared.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis and Dee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, guys, fear is a great motivator to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. Frank, look, while it is, uh, awful that they removed our movies, I think it's probably best in this instance to just let sleeping dogs lie.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We'll just put them in the past, and we'll move on.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Guys, Lethal Weapon 5 and 6 are in the past.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Now we have the path forward and the knowledge to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I think it's obvious what that right thing is.</p>
<p>Make Lethal Weapon 7.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Let's get going on it.</p>

<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You know, as we all know, guys, our Lethal Weapon movies were always intended to be a trilogy that followed a trilogy, plus a sequel, but the most important thing is making sure that this third movie in a series of seven can be seen and enjoyed by audiences of today's moral and ethical standards.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Right, because the-the first time we made that one mistake, and that was...</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Well, uh, actually two, because you did blackface in the sequel.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Ooh, right. The two mistakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, uh, so did Dee, actually.</p>
<p>Okay, so three, we... three mistakes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you've also done multiple insensitive characters in the past, you know, on and off-screen.</p>
<p>You've played...</p>
<p>I don't know if that's going into the conversation we're having here.</p>
<p>It should.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and Frank did red-face in...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's also frowned upon.</p>
<p>Oh, Christ Almighty.</p>
<p>It's also frowned upon.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what? Let's not... Six, seven, eight, nine, ten mistakes. Guys, let's not get into it, <strong>Frank</strong>: It wasn't red, it was brown. because Hollywood has a very clear moral code on mistakes. Okay, you get one, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Like Woody Allen, right? Roman Polanski.</p>
<p>One mistake and that was it.</p>
<p>Uh, no, actually, those guys continued to make films for the next 40 years.</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>Well, he made about 50 mistakes. ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>And-and I would actually argue that all these things we're talking about, they-they weren't so much mistakes as they were violent sexual crimes.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, Right. but either way, look, the point is, I think we should make a few adjustments to the script, you know, and to our casting choices, to make sure that this film is palatable to a modern audience.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, as long as I get to bang the broad.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Uh, I think we might want to avoid that, as well.</p>
<p>How about a blow job then?</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Look, a hand job or I'm not paying for this.</p>
<p>( <em>Groans</em> )</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>That's a very important part of the filmmaking process.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I ain't paying for it unless I get a hand job.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You don't even like hand jobs.</p>
<p>Fine. You can get a hand job, but it's got to be under a towel or a blanket because I don't want to see your genitalia.</p>
<p>Can-can-can we just talk about the elephant in the room?</p>
<p>Right? Let's talk about Murtaugh.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now, uh, obviously, I will not be playing Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon 7.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>O-Okay.</p>
<p>I will be magnanimously taking a step back.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like you're talking really slow and taking a bunch of pauses. I don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>I-I'm waiting for you guys to praise me.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, what?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Oh, 'cause I'm doing something anti-racist, and I think I deserve praise for that, do I not?</p>
<p>You don't get praise for telling people you're not racist.</p>
<p>Then why am I doing it?</p>

<p>Sorry I'm a little late.</p>
<p>I got stuck up on some traffic on the 405.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got off at Sepulveda, and then I-I made my way over to Moorpark.</p>
<p>From there, I sort of wiggled down to Tujunga, then I ticky-tackied over to the, to the Laurel Canyon.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, what is she doing?</p>
<p>That accent is terrible.</p>
<p>And what's with all the directions?</p>
<p>Why is she explaining so much?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>W-We found that people had, uh, no idea where the characters were in the first two, so we thought we'd clear it up.</p>
<p>Everyone was confused about where things were happening and what things were happening.</p>
<p>Where props came from, et cetera.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully, Murtaugh's good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, who-who did you wind up getting for that?</p>
<p>Oh, well, so, Frank went under the bridge to get a prostitute for his sex scene.</p>
<p>He talked the pimp into playing Murtaugh, so, you know, some guy named Pepper Jack, or something like that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pepper Jack?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know this guy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Well, he is a pimp.</p>
<p>So, give him the note.</p>
<p>So, you...</p>
<p>Give him the note.</p>
<p>Just tell him to tone it...</p>

<p>Wait, wait, wait. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.</p>
<p>This ain't working for me.</p>
<p>It's not working for me.</p>
<p>Cut. Okay.</p>
<p>It's just not working.</p>
<p>Okay, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. No.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: 'Cause, uh...</p>
<p>Guys, take five.</p>
<p>Yeah, I say that.</p>
<p>I say, "Take five." Also, I say, "Cut," guys, 'cause I am the, I'm the director.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, listen. Listen, Frank.</p>
<p>I agree. It's not working. Okay, Dee is terrible.</p>
<p>Okay. She's terrible, but it's not her, it's my thing.</p>
<p>I'm talking about... Look, like, first of all, it's just, you know, I say, "Big bang."</p>
<p>I ain't even banging this chick.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good point. It's continuity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>You're right. Okay, maybe you could say, "I'm sick of getting jerked around.</p>
<p>I'm ready to explode."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I don't think it's too much to ask for me to have a little real stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Okay, listen, Frank, you should not be actually having sex with anybody.</p>
<p>It's called acting, Dennis.</p>
<p>No. ( <em>Stammers</em> ) Mm.</p>

<p>You were gonna give some notes.</p>
<p>Yes. Uh, yes. Uh...</p>

<p>What's this? Now, I hope you're not, uh, hating on Pepper Jack's flow?</p>
<p>No. No, no, I'm not hating on your...</p>

<p>Are my headphones working?</p>

<p>You guys are... Yeah.</p>
<p>Um, no. I-I think what...</p>
<p>Your flow is great. I think what you're doing's great.</p>
<p>The thing is, maybe this next take, you could do it a little bit more...</p>
<p>A little more...</p>
<p>...Pepper Jack.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A little bit more Pepper Jack.</p>
<p>That's what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Well, okay then.</p>
<p>Now we cooking. All right.</p>
<p>Okay. We're cooking.</p>
<p>Thank you, Pepper Jack. Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, no problem, man.</p>
<p>Little more Pepper Jack.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Hey, man, you didn't give him the note.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well...</p>
<p>Guys, look, I-I just don't think we should be silencing Black voices.</p>
<p>Guys, there's a larger issue at play here, and that is that all the people of color that we know are people of the bridges and the streets, okay?</p>
<p>Look, they're pimps and prostitutes, which, I tell you, says a lot more about us than it does about them, that's for sure.</p>
<p>That's not a great look.</p>
<p>That's not...</p>
<p>We're gonna have to do some real soul-searching.</p>
<p>We should really open up our...</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>We got to dig real deep into our contacts, and we got to find, like, diverse voices that don't...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, oh, guys, actually, I think I know how to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity, and I'm hip to your hustle.</p>
<p>Bringing a woman of color to spice things up.</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>Wait, where-where is she? Where is she?</p>
<p>The woman of color? Is right here.</p>
<p>You're a woman of color?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm Persian.</p>
<p>That's the ethnicity from Iran. Hello?</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) He's, uh, ignorant.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's a dearth of Iranian female directors, so thank you.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Yeah, uh, to be clear, you will be the assistant director.</p>
<p>Okay, we'll see. Now, let's talk about payment.</p>
<p>I will accept the following things: coins, cash, checks, food, vape pens, pens in general, scissors.</p>
<p>Sure. Let's-let's move on from this.</p>
<p>Uh, guys, uh...</p>
<p>I made a few changes to the script because Dee was, well, she was terrible.</p>
<p>Oh, I could see that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I sent her out to lunch, and I'd like to shoot before she gets back.</p>
<p>So can we do that?</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Let's shoot. Okay, guys, let's get to places.</p>
<p>Okay, guys, let's get to places.</p>
<p>Uh, well, I... That's what the director...</p>
<p>Well, let's get to places.</p>
<p>Let's get to places. Director in the house.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. I'll give the note.</p>
<p>Can you just let her speak?</p>

<p>Uh, I got off on "Spelly-ba-da," but I took that all the way down to Moorpark.</p>
<p>And then I took that down to "Ta-ca-ha" Cucamonga.</p>
<p>And then I tackied all the way over to Laurel Canyon. Ticky.</p>
<p>Uh, this is gonna be tough to cut around.</p>
<p>( <em>Sighs</em> ) Artemis, did-did you give Pepper Jack the note?</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah, I simply asked him if he's ever been to a child's birthday party.</p>
<p>He said yes. I said, "Take us to that place.</p>
<p>Make it authentic to your experience."</p>
<p>What? What do you mean this is not my kid?</p>
<p>Are you motherfucker kidding me?</p>
<p>I've been paying child support for five years, and Pepper Jack's pullout game is strong.</p>
<p>So, if I don't get some answers real fast, Pepper Jack about to cut all of y'all.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Go with it, Charlie. We can use it.</p>
<p>What's next? Come on. The phone.</p>
<p>The phone. The phone. We're going to the phone bit.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Fix it, Charlie. Fix it.</p>
<p>All right, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, man, I would cut, I would cut someone, too. Damn.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure you do have a good pullout game, Pepper Jack.</p>
<p>( <em>Phone ringing</em> )</p>
<p>Uh-oh. What's that? This is phone, that I've whole had on me this time.</p>
<p>( <em>Phone beeps</em> )</p>

<p>No! No butter. There's no butter involved.</p>

<p>It don't work the other way.</p>

<p>You gonna have to pay Pepper Jack, whether you bust a nut or not.</p>
<p>You understand that, don't you?</p>
<p>I don't know what's happening. Are we still in the scene?</p>

<p>Let's take a five.</p>
<p>Listen. Guys, none of this is working.</p>
<p>You think we got to fire Pepper Jack?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. His anger and intensity are-are good, you know?</p>
<p>Just... not for this role. ( <em>Sighs</em> )</p>
<p>I think we need to recast Murtaugh.</p>
<p>We need someone lovable, someone versatile, someone with the skill, range, and talent of one of the best actors of our generation.</p>
<p>We need Don Cheadle.</p>
<p>You know Don Cheadle?</p>
<p>No. But I know the guy that plays him.</p>
<p>( <em>Jazzy music playing</em> )</p>

<p>Oh, sorry I'm late. People be driving like bitches on the 405.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>And my level of intensity is because I am crazy on account of my wife's murder.</p>
<p>In case anybody is feeling uncomfortable about it.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed it works.</p>
<p>( <em>Phone ringing</em> )</p>
<p>Hold that thought, son. My shit be blowing up.</p>
<p>Talk to me.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>What are you doing in this park in my neighborhood?</p>
<p>Who is this, bitch?</p>
<p>It's Karen. Karen White.</p>
<p>And I live in this neighborhood, and I am sure that you do not.</p>
<p>And if you don't leave right now, I will call the police, and I will tell them you attacked me.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how this is a villain.</p>
<p>Well, one of the last socially acceptable groups to villainize are entitled white women.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>It's just, like, making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It's not fun, is it?</p>
<p>It's no fun.</p>
<p>No. She's a cuոt. She's a cuոt.</p>
<p>You want our movie to be fun.</p>
<p>She's a little bit cunty. It's just too real.</p>
<p>Damn it, guys. I really wanted this to work.</p>
<p>I really did, but maybe putting up any group of people as villains these days is potentially problematic. I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe-maybe villains shouldn't be people at all, huh?</p>
<p>Wait, you're totally right. Right?</p>
<p>Like wh... Like what if we make the villain, like, a big dog or something, right?</p>
<p>Or a bunch of raccoons stacked up in a trench coat? You know? ( <em>Gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Or a trench coat full of bees flying around?</p>
<p>Like, that would scare me. Imagine seeing that.</p>
<p>Bees! Bees are cool.</p>
<p>Bees are scary.</p>
<p>What about, like, a plague? An act of God.</p>
<p>All the best villains in the Bible were acts of God.</p>
<p>A tsunami.</p>
<p>( <em>Overlapping agreements</em> )</p>
<p>Ooh, but, you know what? Let's call it a tidal wave.</p>
<p>That feels less racially charged.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right, right.</p>

<p>I don't want to say that all waves are Asian.</p>

<p>( <em>Dramatic music playing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Tidal wave! Where'd that come from?</p>
<p>Well, no country specifically.</p>
<p>Just an act of God, I guess.</p>
<p>No God specifically, just the universe or whatever.</p>
<p>This is a piece of shit.</p>
<p>( <em>Mac sighs</em> )</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can't work like this.</p>
<p>No. ( <em>Stammers</em> )</p>
<p>We can't even get past the first scene.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what the point of making a movie is if we can't even be in it.</p>
<p>Yeah, or bang whores.</p>
<p>All right, guys, listen.</p>
<p>We can still do this. Okay, what about this?</p>
<p>What if Riggs and Murtaugh start to shoot out a path so that the tidal wave moves to a field that's been decimated by climate change.</p>
<p>That doesn't even make any sense.</p>
<p>Climate change? That's so dumb.</p>
<p>That sucks, man. I don't want to watch that movie.</p>
<p>Guys, I know it's not great, all right?</p>
<p>But it's the right thing to do, and we have to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Since when do you care about doing the right thing?</p>
<p>Guys, guys, listen, listen.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year, I've learned to listen, to not talk, to grow.</p>
<p>Guys, I'm woke.</p>
<p>Okay? Now, let me tell you how I reached this awakening.</p>
<p>I was on a date, and, as usual, I fibbed about my age a bit so I could score a younger prospect.</p>
<p>The woman was in her 20s, and the date was going quite well, or so I thought.</p>
<p>It becomes just, like, so clear that the patriarchy is-is really just an off-shoot of privilege.</p>
<p>( <em>Stammers</em> ) Uh, 100%. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I... Yeah. Um...</p>
<p>You know, you have the most beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Thanks. D... ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Don't you agree with what I was just saying, though?</p>
<p>Abso... Yeah. Tot... I mean, yeah. ( <em>Stammers</em> ) Whatever.</p>
<p>Whatever?</p>
<p>Listen, can... can we just keep this light, you know?</p>
<p>I'm-I'm less interested in politics and more interested in what makes you tick.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, you're gross. God.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: The young generation on the left seemed to be a tough nut to crack, so I turned my attention to the youth of the right.</p>
<p>Socialists are ripping away our freedom.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It's a slippery slope until we are living in a failed welfare state.</p>
<p>Right. Hey, what do you say we get out of here and get into our own slippery state?</p>
<p>You know what I mean, Lisa?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm talking about us banging, you conservative little minx.</p>
<p>Pig.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I was learning.</p>
<p>This generation is more socially active on both sides of the aisle, so... this time, I engaged.</p>
<p>I mean, don't you agree?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We need to allow others a chance to speak for once.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but even by saying, "Allow," you're implying that you have all the power.</p>
<p>Uh, but I thought you were saying I did have the power?</p>
<p>Are you twisting my words?</p>
<p>No. I'm just, uh...</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) I'm just trying to understand what the hell you're talking about. I-I can't follow.</p>
<p>( <em>Scoffs</em> ) See? This is exactly what old people always do.</p>
<p>Old people?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>I'm 26.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: But my rational thinking and my desire for an open dialogue were a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>It was all starting to make sense.</p>
<p>See, this generation doesn't even understand half the shit that they're saying.</p>
<p>They aren't more ethical than us.</p>
<p>They just want to be perceived as such.</p>
<p>And who could blame them?</p>
<p>I mean, they've spent their entire adult lives only 280 characters away from being tweeted into oblivion.</p>
<p>Either way, I took a new tack...</p>
<p>We need to use our privilege as much as we possibly can to protect people.</p>
<p>How can you not see that?</p>
<p>We need to use our privilege to protect people as much as we can.</p>
<p>How can I not see that?</p>
<p>Because if we don't, who will?</p>
<p>Because if we don't, who will?</p>
<p>Exactly. What we need is a revolution.</p>
<p>Exactly. What we need is a revolution.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Simply regurgitating back to them exactly what they're saying to each other in their ridiculous echo chambers is all they want.</p>
<p>And then, we can get what we want.</p>
<p><strong>Anna</strong>: Yes, Daddy! ( <em>Moaning</em> )</p>
<p>Daddy!</p>
<p>( <em>Groaning</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Anna panting</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Oh, also they're riddled with insecurity and have serious daddy issues, so that helps.</p>
<p>Guys, we have to listen to the young.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we are doomed to have sex with only old people for the rest of our lives, and I won't do that.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I never thought about that, man.</p>
<p>So, you know what I say?</p>
<p>Finger on the pulse, finger on the puss.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>That's gross.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying now.</p>
<p>So-so what do we do?</p>
<p>I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>( <em>Quietly</em> ): All right.</p>
<p>Uh, hi.</p>
<p>Hey, hey.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Uh, Mr...</p>
<p>Cheadle... Uh, Donovan McNabb...</p>
<p>T-Tiger Woods, Elvin... whatev-whatever your name is. Um, listen, we have, uh, we have come to the conclusion that, um, you and only you have the knowledge, the experience and the-the authenticity to tell this story.</p>
<p>So, we are gonna do the right thing. We're gonna, we're gonna do the woke thing, and hand complete creative control over to you...</p>
<p>I feel like you were gonna say something else?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>I think he was waiting for the applause.</p>
<p>Well... ( <em>Chuckles</em> )</p>
<p>Oh. Okay? Uh...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! Yay!</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>If you must.</p>
<p>It's nice when it happens, isn't it?</p>
<p>Feels nice.</p>
<p>Sure. Nice when it happens naturally.</p>
<p>When it happens naturally, I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, um, listen, the point is, we want you to know that we are allies.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>We are allies.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: We are your allies.</p>
<p>Up top.</p>
<p>Allies!</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>( <em>Whooping</em> )</p>
<p>We're on your side.</p>
<p>( <em>Dramatic music plays</em> )</p>
<p><strong>Geoffrey</strong>: But were they?</p>
<p>Lethal Weapon 7 was destined to be an inferno of quasi-wokeness and, uh, good old-fashioned racism.</p>
<p>( <em>Chuckles</em> ) Out of the, uh, smoldering ashes, however, I pieced together a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>An exploration, not of what is gained by learning, but of what is lost by staying ignorant.</p>
<p>( <em>Explosion</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>Audience applauding, cheering</em> )</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.</p>
<p>Where does he get off telling our story without even including us at all?</p>
<p>And he made us look like assholes.</p>
<p>I feel used.</p>
<p>I feel misunderstood.</p>
<p>What does he know about our experience?</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll tell you, there's only one thing left to do.</p>
<p>Make Lethal Weapon 8?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>( <em>Overlapping chatter, agreement</em> )</p>
<p>Yes. Yes!</p>
<p>I'll play Murtaugh.</p>
<p>Goddamn it, Mac.</p>
<p>I-I'll play Murtaugh.</p>
<p>No! No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Did you not watch the...</p>
<p>I'll do it good.</p>
