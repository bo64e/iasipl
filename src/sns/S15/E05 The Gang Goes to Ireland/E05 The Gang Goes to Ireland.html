<p>He's not really gonna do it, dude, he's just being dramatic.</p>
<p>Do it, bitch!</p>
<p>Yeah, do it, bitch.</p>
<p>I'm not really gonna do it. It's just a cry for help.</p>
<p>Yeah, no shit! Just-just come pick us up, all right?</p>
<p>All right, all right, goodbye!</p>
<p>Wait, let me get this bag...</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Come on, let's get this stuff out of here.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous, man. What are you doing?</p>
<p>You're throwing it in a keg, seriously?</p>
<p>What, what are you gonna do? I got to get rid of 'em.</p>
<p>She has arrived, the obnoxious American MILF is walking!</p>
<p>The MILF is walking.</p>
<p>You're two hours late.</p>
<p>Am I now? Oh, gosh. Well, I did get caught up in a little bit of a shred-and-spread, plus it's hard to tell with the time difference.</p>
<p>Um, you can show me to my trailer now.</p>
<p>And I'd love a cup of coffee... Two creams, please?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I am so confused.</p>
<p>Is this more makeup?</p>
<p>( <em>Stammers, gasps</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn! I mean...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it looks as though the makeup did redistribute down into my, my eye area.</p>
<p>I think just a quick touch-up from a professional would do the trick.</p>
<p>Okay, ma'am, I don't know what's going on with you, but please leave my set.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no... no, come on. Give me a chance, please.</p>
<p>I can still be an obnoxious American mom you'd like to F!</p>
<p>Please, just give me a chance.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, we've already recast your part.</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>Do you two know each other?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I asked you first!</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>I've just been backpacking across Europe.</p>
<p>About an hour ago, some guy approached me, said I'd be perfect for an obnoxious American MILF.</p>
<p>Here I am.</p>
<p>You don't know what you're doing! You're not even an actor.</p>
<p>Neither are you.</p>
<p>Oh, you bitch!</p>
<p>Oh, you dumb bitch!</p>
<p>Okay. Security!</p>
<p>Get this woman off my set!</p>
<p>Don't you start!</p>
<p>Security!</p>
<p>Don't you...</p>
<p>Come on, man! Okay, okay, okay, it's fine!</p>
<p>Okay, it's fine. Everyone, listen, please.</p>
<p>Please, please, I'm begging you.</p>
<p>I'm begging you... I need this so bad!</p>
<p>I need this worse than I've ever needed anything in my entire life.</p>
<p>Please give me a role, any role.</p>
<p>A speaking role.</p>
<p>I'll say anything.</p>
<p>I'll also do anything.</p>
<p>That won't be necessary.</p>
<p>Is it the black eyes, like...?</p>
<p>Because I don't trade roles for sex.</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn feminists ruin everything.</p>
<p>Come on, man.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>L-Look, we're casting for the role of "abused wife" for a scene that shoots tomorrow.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It's only one line, but...</p>
<p>I suppose given your current face situation...</p>
<p>Yes, I'll take it! I'll nail it!</p>
<p>I'm gonna be fucking hilarious! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You'll see, you'll see how funny I am.</p>
<p>The role is "abused wife."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's nothing funny about it.</p>
<p>Oh, dramatic role.</p>
<p>Even better. That's where the awards are.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever. Just be here tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Okay, yep, yep. No, I won't.</p>
<p>And don't be late.</p>
<p>Abused wife! Is it Abused Wife Number One?</p>
<p>Or... It doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I'm gonna nail it.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Well, gentlemen, this driving experience has become much more charming now that I've switched to driving on the correct side of the road. Huh?</p>
<p>( <em>Horn honks</em> )</p>
<p>See, the Irish are so accommodating.</p>
<p>They-they don't want to drive headfirst into a maniac.</p>
<p>They will simply move to avoid us.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>( <em>Coughing</em> )</p>
<p>Dude, are you sick?</p>
<p>( <em>Coughing</em> ): I'm not sick.</p>
<p>I think I'm c-coughing 'cause of all the European exhaust.</p>
<p>The air is probably thick with, uh, petrol.</p>
<p>He can't smell nothing.</p>
<p>Plus he's got a fever.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Do you think you might have COVID, dude?</p>
<p>I-I don't have COVID, okay?</p>
<p>It's probably just, like, allergies or something.</p>
<p>( <em>Horn honking</em> )</p>
<p>You know? Swerve, asshole!</p>
<p>Do you want to collide with an oncoming car?!</p>
<p>( <em>Coughing</em> )</p>
<p>Oh, my God, I'm on a call sheet!</p>
<p>That's my name!</p>
<p>I can't believe this!</p>
<p>I'm gonna be an abused wife!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>This is the greatest day of my life... oh, shit!</p>
<p>Got to look right when you're in Ireland.</p>
<p>That would've been stupid...</p>
<p>( <em>Tires screech</em> )</p>
<p>( <em>All shouting</em> )</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Oh, G...</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Aw, man!</p>
<p>Oh, goddamn it, Dee!</p>
<p>Why weren't you looking?</p>
<p>Well, she looked right.</p>
<p>Well, you got to look both ways.</p>
<p>I mean, that's standard shit, man.</p>
<p>All right, well, don't yell at her... she's unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right, you know what, Frank, give her some stew.</p>
<p>I finished the stew.</p>
<p>All right, uh, maybe breathe your stewy breath in her face?</p>
<p>Stew and stew breath have never...</p>
<p>( <em>Coughing</em> )</p>
<p>You definitely have COVID, man.</p>
<p>You're the only one that didn't get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I'm fine, I'm fine. Now, we told Dee that we were gonna pick her up from her acting gig, and that's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>We're gonna, we're gonna pick her up.</p>
<p>Pick her up? I mean... she's all gangly and then I'm gonna be crammed in the backseat with an unconscious person.</p>
<p>Like, is there anything else we can do?</p>

<p>All right, th-this is just gonna be much better, I think, you know?</p>
