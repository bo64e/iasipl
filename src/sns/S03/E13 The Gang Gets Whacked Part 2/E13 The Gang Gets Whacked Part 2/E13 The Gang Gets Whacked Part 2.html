<p>We keep putting more on, and It's not showing up at all.</p>
<p>Well, then I guess cocaine is weightless, all right?</p>
<p>I'm gonna file that up here actually.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Cleaning my hands off.</p>
<p>What are you, a cat? Use a towel. My mouth's right here.</p>
<p>We talked about this. No getting high on the supply.</p>
<p>I'm not getting high. I'm just cleaning my hands.</p>
<p>We have to be very careful, considering our past addictions to glue and crack.</p>
<p>We got over that.</p>
<p>I got over that.</p>
<p>I don't smoke crack anymore.</p>
<p>You huff glue every single day.</p>
<p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>No? Did you have any today?</p>
<p>It's still gross, Frank.</p>
<p>We made a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>No. I made a thousand dollars. You didn't do shit.</p>
<p>You just sat in the car and read a magazine. What the hell do I need you for?</p>
<p>Give me that money.</p>
<p>Every ho needs his pimp.</p>
<p>We got any vials around here? Vials for what?</p>
<p>We went back to Bingo. We got a little of the cocaine back... with the money that we got from the pills.</p>
<p>You better go back and get a gun, because dealin' drug is dangerous.</p>
<p>No, it isn't. It's a rich person's drug. There's no danger involved.</p>
<p>It's, like, stockbrokers and high-powered business executives.</p>
<p>We'll just go down to Center City and...</p>
<p>Waltz into a board meeting, slap your drug down on the conference table... and be, like, "Hey, you guys wanna buy drug? We're drug dealers. "</p>
<p>Are you saying that's not gonna work? What are you saying?</p>
<p>What are you saying exactly?</p>
<p>I'm saying that that is not gonna... You don't like that idea?</p>
<p>At least we didn't become prostitutes.</p>
<p>I am not a prostitute. I am providing... Let me handle this.</p>
<p>Dennis is providing a very important service to lonely people in need.</p>
<p>Really? So he speaks for you now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was... He doesn't have to speak if he doesn't want to.</p>
<p>I don't? Really? No. You leave everything to me.</p>
<p>All you have to do is sit there, relax, have yourself a drink... and just keep looking handsome.</p>
<p>Okay. I like that arrangement.</p>
<p>Get me a beer, Frank.</p>
<p>Oh, no beer. Too many calories.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It's all about keeping this body fit. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Ehheh. I'll get you a nice vodka tonic.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn't have much calories... so I think that's a smart... drink.</p>
<p>I take care of my boy.</p>
<p>Every time you talk, you weaken the nation. Shut up.</p>
<p>Why you wanna hurt me? I'm not hurtin' you. Just shut up and play cards.</p>
<p>You're judgin'. You judge me all the time.</p>
<p>I'm just tryin' to remain elegant over here.</p>
<p>Don't try so hard.</p>
<p>Remain quiet.</p>
<p>Oh! Youse guys got the right idea with these.</p>
<p>It's, like, the perfect mix of comfort and wind resistance.</p>
<p>They make that In men's?</p>
<p>Huh? I think this is men's. Yeah, it's men's.</p>
<p>Listen, guys. I was thinkin' we go down to Paddy's, put the squeeze on 'em.</p>
<p>We're right in the middle of somethin' right now.</p>
<p>Don't you guys do anything besides play cards and eat deli meats?</p>
<p>Go wash my car.</p>
<p>Fellas! I feel like I'm being seriously underutilized here.</p>
<p>Look, if you just give me a chance...</p>
<p>I could show you how hard I actually am.</p>
<p>What? That's right. I'm so hard that people are scared of me.</p>
<p>And they should be, 'cause I'll explode all over them.</p>
<p>What's the matter with you? I'm eatin' here.</p>
<p>What? What are you talkin' about, your dick?</p>
<p>My dick? No, I'm talkin' about my brute force and my catlike reflexes.</p>
<p>You hear that, Anthony?</p>
<p>He's got catlike reflexes.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Hands like a cat.</p>
<p>You know what? I think someone just earned themselves a nickname.</p>
<p>Really? What?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>From now on, you'll be known as Pussy Hands.</p>
<p>I'd like to go on record saying I don't like Pussy Hands.</p>
<p>But Cougar Hands would be good.</p>
<p>Here's to you, Pussy Hands.</p>
<p>That's great. It's settled.</p>
<p>Hey, Pussy Hands, go wash my car.</p>
<p>How about Jaguar Hands?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Leopard Hands?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Panther Hands.</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Go get your saucer of milk, honey.</p>
<p>He does have gorgeous hands though.</p>
<p>Excuse us.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Sir? Ma'am?</p>
<p>Hi. Would you two be interested in...</p>
<p>These people are just walking too fast.</p>
<p>You know what we should do? We should go back to the country club.</p>
<p>Remember the country club, with the jockeys?</p>
<p>This about the horse, Charlie? It is about the horse.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. I'm pretty sure those jockeys are raping that horse.</p>
<p>They're raping the shit out of it. Excuse me, sir. Can I talk...</p>
<p>They're racing by us as fast as they can.</p>
<p>These people are revved up. They're in fifth gear, and we're stuck in first.</p>
<p>We need to boost our r.p.m.'s. </p>
<p>Let's get goin' a little bit.</p>
<p>What are you suggesting?</p>
<p>A little dip into our Bolivian marching powder, then we're back on the street.</p>
<p>Not in your nose. That's how you become a drug addict.</p>
<p>Rub it all over your gums, Dee. All over your gums.</p>
<p>Okay. Feel that? How's that feel for you?</p>
<p>Whoa. I see what you mean, Charlie.</p>
<p>I see... It's like my mouth is no longer a part of my head.</p>
<p>I kind of feel nothing, but it feels so good.</p>
<p>That's the feeling you're going for. That's where you wanna be at.</p>
<p>Keep reapplying every 10 to 15 minutes. That's what I've been doing.</p>
<p>It kinda wears down. What?</p>
<p>Charlie. Ten to 15 minutes?</p>
<p>No. We're gonna run out. No more gumming for a little while.</p>
<p>No more gumming. We're good though.</p>
<p>I'm ready. I'm good.</p>
<p>I feel pretty good.</p>
<p>I feel weird, but pretty good. Let's start the show.</p>
<p>Let's be like Wall Street and... Rickety Cricket.</p>
<p>That's Rickety Cricket!</p>
<p>Rickety!</p>
<p>Rickety Cricket!</p>
<p>Rickety!</p>
<p>Rickety Cricket!</p>
<p>Rickety!</p>
<p>Where have you been hiding? Where have you been?</p>
<p>They let you become a priest again, huh? Congratulations.</p>
<p>It's the reverend. Hey, man. How you doin', man?</p>
<p>Keep your head up, Reverend. Keep the faith.</p>
<p>Bless you.</p>
<p>Oh. Yikes. I get it.</p>
<p>It's like... Okay.</p>
<p>Ever since you convinced me to abandon the church... my life has been in a bit of a tailspin.</p>
<p>Who? Me or Charlie?</p>
<p>You, Dee. You.</p>
<p>That doesn't ring a bell. There was something that happened.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure that it was that. I don't think it was that.</p>
<p>So you're livin' on the streets now, Cricket.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm living... That's great. That's really great.</p>
<p>Actually, it's the opposite of great, Charlie.</p>
<p>It's one of the darkest times of my life.</p>
<p>Is it? Is it? That makes sense. Yes.</p>
<p>But the good thing is that you must know a lot of drug addicts.</p>
<p>Yes. I was actually attacked by a couple last night. Almost got stabbed.</p>
<p>Really? That's great.</p>
<p>Did you? Did you really?</p>
<p>Wonderful, Cricket. Then you can help us sell our cocaine.</p>
<p>Do you know those guys?</p>
<p>Can you sell drug to them?</p>
<p>Do you bump into them? Do you guys hang out on certain corners?</p>
<p>Are you close?</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>You want me to sell drug for you?</p>
<p>We would do it, but we're not street urchins. Yeah, man. Yeah.</p>
<p>Know what I mean?</p>
<p>But you.</p>
<p>They would buy drug from a street urchin like yourself.</p>
<p>You got the "street urchin" thing goin' on.</p>
<p>Please stop calling me a street urchin. I'm not a street urchin.</p>
<p>You are what you are now.</p>
<p>You know what I'm sayin'.</p>
<p>I was a priest. I have a master's in theology.</p>
<p>That was then. This is now.</p>
<p>What good's it doing you?</p>
<p>I am trying to get my life back on track.</p>
<p>I don't think selling drug is a smart move.</p>
<p>Uhoh. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Come on, Cricket.</p>
<p>I guess Charlie and I didn't see you sitting atop your homeless ivory tower.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, oh.</p>
<p>What is your problem? You just push my buttons, don't you?</p>
<p>You just enjoy pushing my buttons.</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>I've done nothing to her.</p>
<p>Can I stop this little lovers' quarrel?</p>
<p>You're not fooling anybody, Cricket.</p>
<p>Clearly, the two of you have strong feelings for each other... and you're letting that get in the way of a good business deal here.</p>
<p>Look, Cricket, for the love of God, help us out here, man.</p>
<p>I am not...</p>
<p>I tell you what. I'll let you stay at Dee's place.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Till you're back up on your feet.</p>
<p>Dee's place? Yeah. You two alone, together.</p>
<p>One thing could lead to another. You never know.</p>
<p>You think she still likes me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure. I know we have sort of a sexual tension.</p>
<p>No, no, no. You guys got your own thing going on.</p>
<p>I gotta take a cut now, Cricket. We're working together.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Frank. I can't believe you had that thing made.</p>
<p>Every pimp has a chalice.</p>
<p>This one is the shit.</p>
<p>Great. How much money did you drop on that?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>You spend a shitload of money on a chalice you're just gonna eat cereal out of... but you won't bail us out by paying the mob?</p>
<p>By the way, your Jane is sitting over there.</p>
<p>Aw, you gotta be kid... Dude, she's, like, a hundred years old.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight tops. That's still extremely old.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not kissing that.</p>
<p>You don't have to kiss her. We can make that one of your rules.</p>
<p>This time, nothing with the ass.</p>
<p>That got really weird last time.</p>
<p>What are you talkin' about? You didn't set up that ass play on the last one?</p>
<p>No. I never set up any ass play.</p>
<p>All right. Well.</p>
<p>I wanna set up a doctor's appointment anyway just to be... just to be safe.</p>
<p>All right. Do that.</p>
<p>All right. Here we go.</p>
<p>Hypothetically speaking here... do you think you could teach a horse to sit on a barstool and drink beer?</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe. Would you hypothetically pay really good money to see that?</p>
<p>Is this about bringing a horse back to the bar? That is completely insane.</p>
<p>I'm askin' hypothetical questions here.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm a little preoccupied with worrying about being killed by the mob... because a homeless priest ran off with all of our drug. Sure. Sure.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>It's Matt.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Matthew Mara.</p>
<p>It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket.</p>
<p>Hey! Come on in, man.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Come in. Oh! Yeah!</p>
<p>Where should I put this?</p>
<p>Why does he have that?</p>
<p>Why does he have his stuff? Charlie said I could move... It's not important.</p>
<p>Look at this place.</p>
<p>It's exactly as I imagined it would be. What is?</p>
<p>Cricks? How'd you do with our drug, man?</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, I sold 'em. Here.</p>
<p>Hey, is there a dream catcher above your bed?</p>
<p>shit, shit, shit! Holy shit! Look at all that money.</p>
<p>That is a huge wad of money. This is more money than we make at the bar.</p>
<p>I have never seen this much money in one spot. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I guess we can pay the mob back.</p>
<p>We can definitely pay them back.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>But we have another day.</p>
<p>We have a whole day. We have 24 whole hours to go. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</p>
<p>He flipped this in what?</p>
<p>No time really.</p>
<p>He flipped it so fast, Charlie.</p>
<p>Let's think a little bit for a second.</p>
<p>We could flip another batch.</p>
<p>We could pay the mob back.</p>
<p>We could have money left over for ourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe a little coke.</p>
<p>Yeah, more coke.</p>
<p>I can get a horse. You're not gonna get a horse, Charlie.</p>
<p>We can have some coke then. She likes Swiss!</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>I pictured Swiss.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, Cricket.</p>
<p>Cricket, buddy.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p>Look, uh, you did such a fantastic job... that we're gonna need you to go back out there and do it again.</p>
<p>But you guys said it was a onetime thing. We say things all day.</p>
<p>We say words all the time.</p>
<p>We said so many things.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe I'd curl up on that bed of Dee's and I'd sleep with the bear.</p>
<p>Now's not a good time for that, man. I'm so tired.</p>
<p>Are you tired?</p>
<p>I'm just so tired.</p>
<p>Check it out. I got the thing for you right here.</p>
<p>Where'd you get that? Every good dealer keeps a head stash.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Dip your finger in there.</p>
<p>Look, Cricket. I got the thing for you here.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Let's speed you up.</p>
<p>And then you'll wanna get back out there.</p>
<p>Oh. Aah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Shh.</p>
<p>Where am I having dinner tonight, Frank?</p>
<p>I'm kind of in the mood for Asian fusion.</p>
<p>No more dinners. We're going straight to bangin' from now on.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, man.</p>
<p>What, you got a problem?</p>
<p>Yeah. This makes me seem like a whore. You are a whore.</p>
<p>I'm not a whore.</p>
<p>I'm a handsome companion who goes to nice dinners with fancy women... and who has rules about what he'll do.</p>
<p>What happened to the rules, Frank?</p>
<p>You can still have your rules.</p>
<p>It says right here... "No Rules. " Don't be so uptight.</p>
<p>I'm walkin' from this...</p>
<p>What the hell, dude?</p>
<p>I'm knocking some sense into you, Dennis. This is all you got.</p>
<p>Dude, why do you keep hitting me?</p>
<p>Don't talk back to me!</p>
<p>Okay. Sorry.</p>
<p>Look, I'm gonna get you out of this.</p>
<p>It's you and me against the world.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you.</p>
<p>You promise?</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>And, hey, I don't wanna hit you, baby.</p>
<p>So please don't make me, okay?</p>
<p>You're my one and only.</p>
<p>You gotta do right by me, okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Come on, Cricket. Where is he, Charlie? Why do we trust him?</p>
<p>He came through for us once. He'll do it again.</p>
<p>This is empty.</p>
<p>Get rid of that.</p>
<p>You know what, this is his whole plan. It's not a plan.</p>
<p>Yeah. He convinced us that he was on our side.</p>
<p>Now he's gonna stab us in the back. I don't think so.</p>
<p>What's with the pants?</p>
<p>These things? These are horse-riding pants. You can't get a horse.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because it's crazy.</p>
<p>Is it any crazier than having a dog that bites or sheds?</p>
<p>Or a cat that poops in a box while it's biting you?</p>
<p>While it's biting you?</p>
<p>Oh! You guys!</p>
<p>Cricket! There you are! What are you doing? Cricket! There you are!</p>
<p>I'm workin' on my moves.</p>
<p>What moves?</p>
<p>For my musical.</p>
<p>I'm writing a musical.</p>
<p>It's about life on the streets. Archangel has to live on the streets and fight crime.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's great. Where are our drug?</p>
<p>I sold the drug.</p>
<p>Good. Give us the money.</p>
<p>Spent the money on these sweetass kettledrums. Look at these.</p>
<p>Those are trash cans.</p>
<p>Trash cans, Cricket!</p>
<p>These are trash cans? Then why do they sound like this?</p>
<p>You "sold" our drug money on two garbage cans?</p>
<p>No. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I did some too.</p>
<p>We can see that! Is there any left? Can we have what's left?</p>
<p>There is some left. You guys are yelling like crazy.</p>
<p>I can't compute.</p>
<p>Don't do all of it.</p>
<p>I still gotta write the seventh act. It's kinda all up here.</p>
<p>Come on back to the bar.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>I'm not going anywhere without these kettledrums. Bring your trash cans.</p>
<p>Yeah, don't forget the trash cans.</p>
<p>I'm bringing the trash cans.</p>
<p>Watch the crack addicts though. They will cut you.</p>
<p>You understand? It's $200 for the first hour... and a hundred and fifty every hour after that.</p>
<p>Unless you want him to act like he's enjoying it.</p>
<p>Then it's a little extra. Eh?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I need... I need you Make it sexy.</p>
<p>I need... I need you You like ass play? He'll do anything with the ass.</p>
<p>I never said...</p>
<p>I wasn't gonna tell...</p>
<p>Don Sal?</p>
<p>Yeah. What?</p>
<p>Forgive me for speaking out of line here, but...</p>
<p>I don't think I'm being properly utilized within the organization.</p>
<p>I've tried to be eager and work with a smile... but I'm not making any forward progress.</p>
<p>Aren't you the janitor?</p>
<p>It's not important, Don Sal.</p>
<p>What is important is that I get out on those streets... and start doing some gangster shit.</p>
<p>There's gotta be a union boss I can put the squeeze on.</p>
<p>Or a truck I can hijack, right?</p>
<p>How would you like to do me a personal favor?</p>
<p>Sounds shady. I'm in.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I need you to go over to my house... and take care of my wife.</p>
<p>You mean, like, rub her out?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You want me to bang her? I'm sorry.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you say that? Communication problem.</p>
<p>What I need you to do is just go over there.</p>
<p>Like a protection thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's somethin' like that.</p>
<p>Okay. I mean, you don't mind gettin' your hands dirty, do you?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Goddamn mafia!</p>
<p>Two hearts that beat as one Like that? Huh?</p>

<p>Two hearts that beat as one Dennis?</p>
<p>We gotta talk. Now.</p>
<p>What the hell you doin' here?</p>
<p>I'm working. What are you doing?</p>
<p>You cannot seriously be thinking about banging this old lady.</p>
<p>No, Mac, you have to separate yourself from the way they look.</p>
<p>Frank says that the only thing that matters in this game is cash.</p>
<p>What did Frank do to you?</p>
<p>Frank takes care of me.</p>
<p>You don't understand the nature of our relationship. What?</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! You! Out! This is our turf. Get out.</p>
<p>Frank, he cannot bang this woman. It's the mob boss's wife.</p>
<p>What do you think she's gonna do... call her husband and say she's banging a whore?</p>
<p>Dennis, up those stairs.</p>
<p>Dennis, don't do it.</p>
<p>He's got you brainwashed.</p>

<p>What about you, Pussy Hands?</p>
<p>Me? Oh, no. I would never sleep with you. You're gross.</p>
<p>Last taste. Last taste.</p>
<p>One more. That's it.</p>
<p>Last one. That's it because we're almost out of it.</p>
<p>We can't do this.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>All right. Okay.</p>
<p>Here's the plan.</p>
<p>I'm gonna cut it with flour. I don't think the mob's gonna know the difference.</p>
<p>You sure that's gonna work? People do it all the time. I think this will trick 'em.</p>
<p>That's too much, huh?</p>
<p>That's too much flour.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>They're gonna kill us!</p>
<p>We're dead!</p>
<p>Here's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>We're dead 'cause of the flour. We're outta here.</p>
<p>Where we going? We're gonna skip town.</p>
<p>We're gonna go up to the mountains.</p>
<p>We can't tell anybody. We just gotta go. We'll go to the mountains.</p>
<p>We gotta get outta here.</p>
<p>We're gonna have a fresh start.</p>
<p>We'll start over.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>It's just gonna be you and me and Peter Nincompoop.</p>
<p>Who's Peter Nincompoop?</p>
<p>Huh? Huh? Oh, my God.</p>

<p>How did that get here? I rode it here. What do you think?</p>
<p>Hop on. We're outta here.</p>
<p>I'm not hopping on there.</p>
<p>We can't get outta here on that.</p>
<p>We need a car. It's too obvious.</p>
<p>It is?</p>
<p>People will see... us and it.</p>
<p>We gotta get out in a car.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You got a better chance without us, don't you, buddy?</p>
<p>Okay. You know what.</p>
<p>Get outta here. Hah!</p>
<p>Go, Peter Nincompoop!</p>
<p>I miss you already!</p>
<p>I love you, Peter Nincompoop.</p>
<p>Mmm. Let's go.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>What are you doin'?</p>
<p>I'm gonna try and stay sharp here. That's mostly flour.</p>
<p>But if we do enough of it, it should still work, right?</p>
<p>Well, then, let's do a lot of it. Let's go!</p>
<p>That's a pop. That's a pop. That's a pop.</p>
<p>Make it sexy.</p>
