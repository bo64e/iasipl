<p>Goddamn, I'm bored!</p>
<p>Come on. Let's do something.</p>
<p>We're a little busy here, Frank.</p>
<p>What the hell are you reading?</p>
<p>In Touch.</p>
<p>In Touch?</p>
<p>Why would you read that crap?</p>
<p>We are trying to stay "in touch" with what's happening in the world.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if we like to keep ourselves informed.</p>
<p>You want to be informed?</p>
<p>Read a newspaper. Dude!</p>
<p>Nobody gets their news from a newspaper anymore.</p>
<p>Ah, no, no, no. But, Dennis, look.</p>
<p>"Plutonium smuggled into Syria. "</p>
<p>That's gonna change my life drastically.</p>
<p>That's gonna change everyone's lives! No one can go to Syria anymore for vacation!</p>
<p>Don't you guys get tired of doing nothin' except sitting around drinking?</p>
<p>What does that mean? Is that a joke?</p>
<p>How could you get tired of that?</p>
<p>Heyoh! What's up, bitches?</p>
<p>What is up?</p>
<p>Turn the TV on right now, dude!</p>
<p>This is huge! Turn the TV on!</p>
<p>I'm gonna be on the news!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There was an accident today. Then the news talker asked Mac what happened.</p>
<p>And he totally went off! I went off for 20 minutes. It was amazing.</p>
<p>I totally popped. Here it is! Oh, you popped. You're gonna be famous.</p>
<p>Shut up! Shut up! This is Ken Jacobs coming to you from Market Street... where two buses collided just minutes ago.</p>
<p>We talked to one local resident who had this to say. It was absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>Police are currently investigating the cause of the accident. Back to you, Jim.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Yeah, you really popped. I think you're gonna be a star.</p>
<p>You're gonna be a big star.</p>
<p>Be in a magazine. No, no, no.</p>
<p>I talked for, like, 20 minutes about how the traffic system sucks.</p>
<p>And the lights... And that we should only have yellow lights... because then we can be very cautious but not get stuck in traffic.</p>
<p>It was great. That sounds incredibly dangerous and stupid.</p>
<p>The point is that that newscaster... that bastard newscaster... just went in there and cut it all up... Cut you all up, dude!</p>
<p>Just to make his corporate bosses happy, which is bullshit.</p>
<p>Nobody's getting the real news anymore! That's not real news.</p>
<p>Remember when we made the news show for eighth grade? For social studies?</p>
<p>Now, see, that was real news. We didn't distort facts!</p>
<p>We told it like it was.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember that video. You guys were burning G.I. Joes and throwing rocks at cats.</p>
<p>That was what was happening! That's what was going on in the world, man!</p>
<p>That was the truth. We'd been throwing rocks at cats for years, Dennis.</p>
<p>We had been! And that's what we were reporting on.</p>
<p>What was happening in the world! We can make better news.</p>
<p>We could, Charlie. You want me to grab my camera?</p>
<p>Yes. Just like the old days. Let's go out there. Let's make some news.</p>
<p>I want in on this action because I am bored to death sitting here.</p>
<p>No, that's a bad idea. Usually when you get involved, somebody gets hurt.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous. I'm just palling around with the guys. How's anybody gonna get hurt?</p>
<p>How much more tape? I just don't want it to jiggle around.</p>
<p>I don't want to put any more tape on it. I'm the one who's carrying it.</p>
<p>What are you guys doing? I've put a light on the front of the camera.</p>
<p>What this does is it makes the news talker look brighter.</p>
<p>It always looked fine when we did it. Frank's got a good idea here.</p>
<p>We're gonna put this stuff on public access TV.</p>
<p>Anybody can get on that!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What? Nobody watches that shit!</p>
<p>Dude, there's all sorts of great stuff on public access.</p>
<p>Oh, is there? Well, let's see what kind of quality programming we have here.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>This is public access.</p>
<p>God, that Is so strange.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Should I turn It off?</p>
<p>No! Well, don't jump to... We'll just keep it on for a little bit.</p>
<p>Let's watch it for a little while. Let's find out what...</p>
<p>Do It.</p>
<p>Get after it, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, let's turn It off! Turn It off! Shut It off!</p>
<p>Okay. We're gonna go down to the power plant... and talk about how it's giving the whole city cancer.</p>
<p>Holy shit, dude! I didn't know that! He's making it up, Charlie.</p>
<p>Why would you do that? That's a great story! It scares the shit out of everybody.</p>
<p>Yeah. Everybody will be terrified.</p>
<p>We don't want to just scare people. We want to blow the lid off of real scandals.</p>
<p>Expose real crime and corruption.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>People don't care about that shit. They want glitz and glamour, celebrities.</p>
<p>They want to read about shit that's gonna help them forget how miserable their lives are.</p>
<p>And pretend like they know what it's like to be famous 'cause that's what everybody wants.</p>
<p>Of course everybody wants to be famous 'cause celebrities get everything.</p>
<p>Easiest job in the world. You don't even have to do anything anymore to be famous.</p>
<p>No. Look at Paris Hilton. She's just a dirty, drunken whore.</p>
<p>You could be famous for being a dirty, drunk whore. You're a dirty, drunk whore already.</p>
<p>I'm not. But I could be famous if I just got drunk, went out to a club... let people shoot some video with their fancy camera phones.</p>
<p>Right. Get a couple of up skirts, a couple nip slips. Boom. You'd be famous like that.</p>
<p>I think I'd like to avoid the nip slips and up skirts. I see where you're going with this.</p>
<p>I'll talk you into it at some point. And I could be famous just by being friends with you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Great. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Frank, Charlie and I are gonna go to where the real action is.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Why'd you drag us to a place like this?</p>
<p>It smells like the bottom of a birdcage.</p>
<p>Lots of shady shit goes down in nursing homes, Frank, okay? These places are like prisons.</p>
<p>Like people getting assraped?</p>
<p>What? Oh, my God, dude. No, not like people getting assraped.</p>
<p>People don't want to be here because they feel like... They're getting assraped.</p>
<p>Nobody's getting assraped, Frank!</p>
<p>God, man. Stop saying "assraped. "</p>
<p>We're locked and loaded here, man. I'm ready to shoot this thing.</p>
<p>Let's talk to this woman. Yeah, let's go. Come on. Let's move.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. I'm gonna do, like, a catchphrase thing.</p>
<p>Ready? In, three, two, one.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Good afternoon, Philadelphia. This is Mac coming to you live from the Malvin Retirement Home.</p>
<p>Go, go, go, go. Hello, miss. What's your name?</p>
<p>Irvene Simon.</p>
<p>Hello, Irvene. Why don't you tell us what's really going on here?</p>
<p>Cool face. Hold It. Hold It.</p>
<p>Well, I get up around 5:00.</p>
<p>5:30, if it's bingo the night before.</p>
<p>Then I eat breakfast.</p>
<p>I like to have fruit.</p>
<p>She steals the grapes!</p>
<p>I do not!</p>
<p>Check her purse! I think we've covered breakfast. Let's move past it.</p>
<p>Good save.</p>
<p>Then after breakfast...</p>
<p>I like to sit and read recipes.</p>
<p>I don't even know how to cook.</p>
<p>Is there anything that you want to tell the world, Irvene?</p>
<p>My grandson's birthday's on Friday.</p>
<p>No, no. Is there anything about this place that you don't like?</p>
<p>The blacks.</p>
<p>Cut!</p>
<p>Cut! Cut that! What are you cutting for? That was just starting to get good.</p>
<p>It was not good, okay? It was the ramblings of a crazy, old racist. Is it hot in here?</p>
<p>I meant to bring this up. How are you sweating so much? It's freezing!</p>
<p>It's freezing! Yeah. They try to keep them alive.</p>
<p>Because meat spoils slower in a fridge. So they keep it cold.</p>
<p>That interview was terrible. It was terrible.</p>
<p>We need a more exciting truth. We do. Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's set this place on fire. Let's burn it to the ground! Now you're talking.</p>
<p>We're not setting a nursing home on fire!</p>
<p>Those curtains would go up like a snap.</p>
<p>No, we need to find a more exciting part of the city. Wait a second.</p>
<p>I know just the place.</p>
<p>The shit's always going down in Chinatown, boys!</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Quick conference, guys.</p>
<p>Everyone keep their eyes peeled for drifting. All right?</p>
<p>People here, they love to... Look. Look at this guy.</p>
<p>He's definitely a drifter. He's going to his car and he's gonna slide it sideways.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. And you know what happens with Tokyo drifting? It leads to bickering.</p>
<p>They always bicker. Which, of course, leads to karate.</p>
<p>Which eventually will lead to dudes flying from window to window and treetop to treetop.</p>
<p>Shooting lightning bolts out of their fingers. Yeah!</p>
<p>There's the guy that shoots the lightning bolts out of his hands!</p>
<p>He wears the big, straw hat. And he does that.</p>
<p>We're on the same page. His eyes go all white and shit.</p>
<p>Let's do It. And Kurt Russell fights him.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, dude. The smell is overwhelming.</p>
<p>What the hell are these guys doing?</p>
<p>They're just trading fish for other fish is what it looks like.</p>
<p>They're not even bickering.</p>
<p>This isn't gonna lead to karate.</p>
<p>I think what we gotta do is find one sick guy and do a story about a new pandemic.</p>
<p>No one cares about those kinda things, Frank. This guy looks sick.</p>
<p>That's the same fish they just passed to each other. Like bird flu, fish flu.</p>
<p>We gotta get 'em to fight. They just passed that same fish head back and forth.</p>
<p>You think we could get 'em to fight? Whoa.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>What's that, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, that looks exciting.</p>
<p>Ooh. Let's go.</p>
<p>That's a bunch of people. Let's go.</p>
<p>Come on. Charlie, fire up that camera.</p>
<p>I'm doing it.</p>
<p>Can you see sweat? Because I'm sweating a little bit. So much.</p>
<p>Yeah? It's a lot? Okay. What if I do... That's better. Go.</p>
<p>Okay. Good afternoon, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>We're here in Chinatown... where a large crowd has gathered for what can only be a martial arts showdown.</p>
<p>You look scared. I'm not. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'm just sweating. It's very hot.</p>
<p>Martial arts. Okay. Martial arts expo... Just go in. Go in.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Love 30.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>A pandemic.</p>
<p>Bird flu! Bird flu!</p>
<p>I think he's choking, guys. What? He is choking!</p>
<p>Frank, give him the Heimlich! I'm not gonna touch him. I don't know what he's got.</p>
<p>Do you know the Heimlich? I don't know the Heimlich! Punch him in the stomach or something.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, baby!</p>
<p>I did it?</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>I did it!</p>
<p>I saved your life! I saved your life, bitch! Whoo! Yeah!</p>
<p>That is exactly the kind of stuff we should be filming.</p>
<p>I'm a hero! You got that, right, Charlie?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I did and I didn't, Frank. What?</p>
<p>I did and I didn't. You were pointing the camera at him, right?</p>
<p>You got it, right? The punch and everything, right? No, I did...</p>
<p>I did point the camera at it. But you know what? I did not put a tape in here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>The problem was that I got the flashlight on. And I taped the whole deal up.</p>
<p>I realized I'd have to cut all the tape off to get the tape in.</p>
<p>I didn't have much more duct tape. So I figured, stick with the flashlight while we got it.</p>
<p>So you never put a tape in? While we were out there taping the guys with the fish!</p>
<p>Oh, my God! See what's happening here? We're getting a yelling...</p>
<p>Yeah, we're gonna get yelling! Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot to put a tape in!</p>
<p>I forgot to put a tape in!</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right! All right.</p>
<p>Here's what we do. We recreate your heroic moment.</p>
<p>That's it. We do it again.</p>
<p>We just recreate it?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>This time we put a tape in... Tape in this time, yes.</p>
<p>Take the light off of it maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we don't sweat so much.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll wear more makeup. Don't blame it on my sweat glands. That's not fair.</p>
<p>We'll just recreate the whole thing. All right, let's...</p>
<p>And you know, you can... And this time I could... I could look a little bit more heroic.</p>
<p>You could look a lot more heroic, bro. We'll put enough makeup on you.</p>
<p>You'll look like the shit. All right.</p>
<p>Let's just make some news, please.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Ooh! I feel like we've been standing in this line forever!</p>
<p>For like our lifetimes! I don't know if we're ever gonna get inside of this place.</p>
<p>Dee, it's a club. You have to wait in a line.</p>
<p>I gotta be honest with you. I feel like I'm just a little bit too drunk to stand up.</p>
<p>You were supposed to wait and get drunk inside the club, not outside the club.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit about a stupid, drunk whore outside of a club.</p>
<p>That's a lot of talking you're doing. I gotta lay down.</p>
<p>Lie down? What are you talking about? What are you doing? Dee? Oh!</p>
<p>Now you're just some stupid, drunk chick lying in garbage.</p>
<p>Night-night. "Night-night"?</p>
<p>Night-night. Great.</p>
<p>You want to come in with us?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Here, take this.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>Oh! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Holy shit, it's bright out here!</p>
<p>Dee, get up. Get up! Come on!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Where am I? I'm crashing pretty hard.</p>
<p>I need to go home and get some sleep.</p>

<p>What happened last night?</p>
<p>Don't make me into the bad guy. I'm going out of my way to make us both famous.</p>
<p>It's not my fault if you're not living up to your end.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, why don't you take my picture now?</p>
<p>Dee, that's not gonna work, okay?</p>
<p>You're not famous yet. You're just some stupid, drunk chick who slept in her own puke.</p>
<p>Really? We'll come back tonight. Come on. Ride's leaving.</p>
<p>Can...</p>
<p>No, come on. I'm not gonna stand in this big line again.</p>
<p>We don't have to wait in line. Famous, drunk whores, they don't wait in line.</p>
<p>They shove their way to the front and they take a shit all over the bouncer.</p>
<p>That's what you're gonna do. Don't know if I feel comfortable taking a shit on that bouncer.</p>
<p>You just gotta talk down to him a little bit. Make him feel like he's beneath you.</p>
<p>That way, he'd be too afraid not to let you in. Right? Really?</p>
<p>The guy doesn't want to lose his job. I don't know.</p>
<p>Dee, do you want to be famous or not?</p>
<p>All right? Take a shit on this guy. Okay.</p>
<p>Shove your way. Go. Shove, shove. I can shit on him, I think.</p>
<p>Hey, look out.</p>
<p>Jesus, you're in my way!</p>
<p>Move it! Move it! Hey!</p>
<p>Okay. Good start.</p>
<p>Short stuff, out of my way.</p>
<p>Yeah, you saw me. Hi, there.</p>
<p>What's your name?</p>
<p>Dee Reynolds.</p>
<p>You on the list? List? I don't need to be on that list, you idiot.</p>
<p>You piece of dirt. Who are you? I step on you.</p>
<p>I clean you off of my shoes at night.</p>
<p>I step on you, and then I throw away the shoe.</p>
<p>That shoe that I just threw away, that's worth more than your worthless life, mister.</p>
<p>And I am pissed because I loved that shoe. You dirt.</p>
<p>You piece of subhuman shit.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. Dee, take it easy, all right?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna take it easy because this talking dump of a bouncer... is starting to get on my nerves.</p>
<p>I'm gonna have you fired, dick hole. Do you know who I am? Do you have any idea?</p>
<p>Or is your brain too tiny to have ideas?</p>
<p>Is there any kind of thought roaming around in that thick, shit skull of yours?</p>
<p>You with her?</p>
<p>No! Nope.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>And what is your name?</p>
<p>Dennis Reynolds.</p>
<p>Dennis Reynolds? Well, what do you know, Dennis Reynolds? You're on the list.</p>
<p>No, no...</p>
<p>Oh, wow. That's awesome.</p>
<p>What? But you're not gonna go in without me, right?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Dancing Guy!</p>
<p>Oh, I love your show, man.</p>
<p>Wow, Dancing Guy!</p>
<p>Stop pressing so hard.</p>
<p>Dude, I have to press hard.</p>
<p>You get so nervous, you sweat through it every time.</p>
<p>Just make sure that it's even.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make it even, man!</p>
<p>You need to just start calming down and relaxing a little bit more, man.</p>
<p>I'm very stressed out, Charlie. It's a very stressful situation. Then relax, dude.</p>
<p>Calm yourself a little bit. Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I just...</p>
<p>No, come on, dude. Shh.</p>
<p>That's not such a...</p>
<p>Well, it's...</p>
<p>Okay? Come on, dude.</p>
<p>Hey, who's that sexy news guy It's Mac Yes, it's Mac It's Mac.</p>
<p>And he's on the channel whatever we make it on news Right?</p>
<p>We're gonna make it on the TV All right, here it is. You go into the building. You go into the building.</p>
<p>You run out.</p>
<p>And get the kitties.</p>
<p>With the little box of cats, right? A box of cats.</p>
<p>And you save them.</p>
<p>You save them!</p>
<p>I save them from what?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Are you gonna set the building on fire?</p>
<p>No! Charlie, are you gonna set the building on fire?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>You want the show to be a hit or what?</p>
<p>I am not running into a burning building! It's gotta be exciting!</p>
<p>That's what the news talkers... Come on, dude.</p>
<p>Well, I quit. 'Cause I can't seem to get into any of the clubs.</p>
<p>And if I can't get into any of the clubs, then how the hell am I supposed to get famous?</p>
<p>Three, two, action.</p>
<p>Good evening, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>We've just received word that... a litter of adorable kittens is stranded somewhere inside this building... that could erupt into flames at any moment!</p>
<p>Who will save them?</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>Now shoot the building now.</p>
<p>What? Okay.</p>
<p>Who will save them?</p>
<p>Move, dude!</p>
<p>I know, but I'm saying... If I could get into the... Go.</p>
<p>Calm down, calm down, calm down, dude!</p>
<p>So I just go grab the box of kittens and run out?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's all there is to it. You'll be famous. Everybody loves a hero.</p>
<p>Okay. Sounds easy enough.</p>
<p>Get to it.</p>
<p>It smells overwhelmingly like kerosene in here!</p>
<p>Uhhuh.</p>
<p>I cannot believe you guys.</p>
<p>I could've been killed!</p>
<p>Somebody had to save those kittens.</p>
<p>They were trapped inside a burning building, Deandra.</p>
<p>You set me on fire! We set the building on fire.</p>
<p>You just happened to catch on fire. Barely.</p>
<p>Yeah, we put you out.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I'm on fire! I'm on fire!</p>
<p>Well, I do look really heroic.</p>
<p>No, you do not look heroic! You threw the box of kittens. How do you figure?</p>
<p>I was on fire!</p>
<p>We gotta shoot this shit again. Yeah, like fire hurts.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, Dancing Guy!</p>
<p>That's the man.</p>
<p>Now this is entertainment.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I can't believe... It doesn't make any sense, man.</p>
<p>It's, like, what is he...</p>
<p>What's the time? Diaper Time!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>They're really stepping up the insanity here.</p>
<p>Where do they find these people? Look at these people.</p>
<p>Do you not find this sad and embarrassing for them? Those people are pieces of shit.</p>
<p>But I want to watch it. So much and so often I want to watch it.</p>
<p>I think we should throw parties and just sort of watch it together.</p>
<p>Because this is television at its best. Definitely.</p>
<p>People love well stories.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes! I feel like well stories are played out.</p>
<p>Who gets stuck in a well anymore? Kittens do.</p>
<p>Kittens? You guys put those kitties in there?</p>
<p>What else were we supposed to put down there, Dee? Oh, man!</p>
<p>All right, fine. I'll do it.</p>
<p>But don't set it on fire, okay?</p>
<p>I feel like this is dangerous enough. Deandra, use your head.</p>
<p>How are we gonna set a well on fire? It's filled with water.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Get in the well!</p>
<p>I'm going! Save the kittens! Save the day!</p>
<p>Give me the matches.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I found the kittens!</p>
<p>Oh, come on!</p>
<p>Okay, it's all good through here.</p>
<p>Hey! There you go. She throws the kittens in every take.</p>
<p>Oh, she loves to ruin and ruin and ruin and ruin.</p>
<p>Do you guys mind keeping it down a little bit?</p>
<p>It's 5:00 in the afternoon. </p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I was at the club all night. What?</p>
<p>Are you turning into a club kid now?</p>
<p>Oh, man. You guys should've been there, man. Everybody was there. It was so awesome.</p>
<p>We've been trying to turn Dee into a hero by, like, getting her to rescue kittens... in compromising situations.</p>
<p>But she messes up every time!</p>
<p>Hey, what if we set up, like, a conveyor belt situation, right?</p>
<p>Put the cats on that. And then at the end of it, a chopping mechanism.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! Let's chop cats! Hey! This is good!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let's chop cats!</p>
<p>We don't actually chop the cats. Dee grabs them before they get chopped.</p>
<p>We'll chop a couple cats so that you know it's real. No.</p>
<p>I don't think anybody's really gonna give a shit about a nobody saving a bunch of kittens.</p>
<p>But a celebrity saving cats... Then you got a story.</p>
<p>So what are you suggesting? I'm building up quite a reputation around town.</p>
<p>Especially in the club scene. With my connections...</p>
<p>I could probably finally get Dee into some of those clubs.</p>
<p>Once she's in those clubs, I can turn her into a celebrity.</p>
<p>And once she's a celebrity, you guys got a story.</p>
<p>You think she's gonna go for that? She's pissed at you, bro, for ditching her there.</p>
<p>I don't think Dee's that desperate to get famous. I mean, nobody's that pathetic.</p>
<p>I can't believe how famous I'm about to be!</p>
<p>Run off to the bathroom and cram a couple fingers down your throat.</p>
<p>Bulimia's really big with this crowd.</p>
<p>I just tried, but I've been throwing up all day long.</p>
<p>I don't think I have any food left inside of me.</p>
<p>Well, try harder. Because it's really important, all right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>If only just for show.</p>
<p>Dennis! Hey! Hey! These are the girls. Don't screw this up.</p>
<p>These girls can make or break you in this town.</p>
<p>Hey. You look gorgeous.</p>
<p>Hey, listen, ladies.</p>
<p>This is my sister.</p>
<p>Notice how disgustingly skinny she is. Isn't it weird?</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>You are like crack skinny!</p>
<p>Oh! Okay!</p>
<p>That's a compliment.</p>
<p>She throws up all the time.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. I just got done.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if my breath stinks.</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis, want one?</p>
<p>Maybe not tonight, ladies.</p>
<p>I'm kinda working on something.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. Don't be a loser.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Well, uh, all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe just one.</p>
<p>Do you have one for my sister too?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>Chop, chop, chop.</p>
<p>Good! Good!</p>
<p>The cat's dead. I don't see any problems with that other than the fact... that the camera might see my hand killing the cat.</p>
<p>We're gonna pull the cat out of there before it gets to the chopper.</p>
<p>But if Sweet Dee doesn't make it in time, you're gonna see me chop the cat.</p>
<p>Just don't drop the cat.</p>
<p>I can't make that promise.</p>
<p>Come on. Whoa! Where have you guys been? You look like shit.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about that.</p>
<p>Did you become celebrities yet?</p>
<p>We're not doing the celebrity thing anymore. We're done with that.</p>
<p>No. We need you guys. 'Cause we got this great chopping mechanism.</p>
<p>It's for the news show. There is no news show, Charlie!</p>
<p>Yes, there is a news show, Dennis!</p>
<p>We're gonna put it on public access!</p>
<p>Nobody watches public access. I don't want to be on public access.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, Dancing Guy's on! No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Turn that off! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Dancing Guy's a great show.</p>
<p>Charlie. No, Charlie. Turn it off, man. Turn it off!</p>
<p>What's the time? Diaper Time!</p>
<p>What's the time? Diaper Time!</p>
<p>Congratulations, guys.</p>
<p>You're famous.</p>
