<p>There's no way a mouse could kill a scorpion.</p>
<p>Dude, a mouse could kill...</p>
<p>It's got sharp claws and teeth.</p>
<p>A rat could kill a scorpion. No shit, Frank, but we're not talking about a rat.</p>
<p>We're talking about a mouse. If we were talking about a rat, it still would lose.</p>
<p>A scorpion's this big. A little mouse fighting a scorpion, and that is final!</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>Shut up! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I don't care!</p>
<p>All we're doing is arguing about the most stupid shit A rat. A scorpion.</p>
<p>I don't care, man!</p>
<p>When did this start happening?</p>
<p>When did we start arguing all the time and fighting? This isn't like us!</p>
<p>Look. We're working our asses off in this bar, and we're getting nothing to show for it... and so we're starting to snip and pick at each other.</p>
<p>And it's bullshit, man. 'Cause guess what. It's a beautiful day outside.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>We need to change things up.</p>
<p>Let's go outside. Let's get some fresh air.</p>
<p>Let's run around a little bit.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Let's just do something different.</p>
<p>You know what, Charlie?</p>
<p>You're right. This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's just nice to do something different for a change.</p>
<p>Yeah. Enjoy a little blue sky, some fresh air.</p>
<p>Yeah. Some, uh, earth beneath our feet. Yeah.</p>
<p>See? I told you guys you'd like it. Yeah.</p>
<p>It's goddamn bright out here.</p>
<p>It's so bright. I can't use my eyes.</p>
<p>There's people playing football right next to us. Like there's no room to drink.</p>
<p>Tell you what. I would like to go back to the bar. Let's go back to the bar!</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, look out. Let me see that. Can I get that back?</p>
<p>Yeah. Go long. I'll toss you a wicked spiral.</p>
<p>Want to just give me the ball, dude? We're trying to practice.</p>
<p>What are you practicing for?</p>
<p>I'm trying out for the Eagles.</p>
<p>Uh, the Philadelphia Eagles?</p>
<p>Yeah. They're holding tryouts for the public.</p>
<p>Like in that movie, Invincible.</p>
<p>Oh! Was that the one where the guy from... the New Kids on the Block makes it onto the Eagles? I saw that.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's the one. That's a good one.</p>
<p>Wait. So they're actually doing that?</p>
<p>Yes. Just give me the football.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, Dennis, I think you know what we have to do.</p>
<p>Dude, did you read this flyer?</p>
<p>Donovan McNabb is gonna be giving us a motivational speech. I know, dude.</p>
<p>We are actually going to be running on the Linc!</p>
<p>Lincoln Field, baby! You guys think you're actually gonna make the team?</p>
<p>No. Hell, no, we're not gonna make the team.</p>
<p>But we will finally get to prove once and for all who's a better football player.</p>
<p>That's right. Trying out for the Eagles is the best way to settle that score.</p>
<p>You know what? I would like to join your little competition.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. You...</p>
<p>You... You're a woman.</p>
<p>Women can't do things like this. You'll get hurt.</p>
<p>No. Women aren't allowed to try out for football.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous. They should at least be able to try out.</p>
<p>Well, there are plenty of other sports that women can try out for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, uh, cooking and...</p>
<p>Complaining to your friends about your boyfriends.</p>
<p>Yeah. Playing... Playing at ballet.</p>
<p>Cleaning. Displaying cars at auto shows in tiny bikinis.</p>
<p>Yeah. When you get older, you can play bridge together. I don't know.</p>
<p>You know what? I am in such better shape than both of you guys.</p>
<p>Do you not think the first thing they're gonna do to weed people out is make you run?</p>
<p>Oh, good luck. I could get so much further than both of you.</p>
<p>You think that's even a possibility? 'Cause that could be very embarrassing for us.</p>
<p>Well, we're never gonna have to find out because she can't try out.</p>
<p>You can't try out! You're not allowed to try out. That is a rule, right?</p>
<p>Check the rules. Okay.</p>
<p>Let's double-check.</p>
<p>We'll put a layer of beer, then a layer of ice...</p>
<p>What are you guys doing? Dude, we're gonna tailgate the tryouts.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. That's a good idea. Oh, you gonna bust out Green Man, bro?</p>
<p>No. No Green Man.</p>
<p>What's Green Man?</p>
<p>Well, in high school, Charlie was like our school mascot.</p>
<p>A mascot nobody wanted. He'd get wasted and dress in this green spandex bodysuit.</p>
<p>Spandex?</p>
<p>It was really sad.</p>
<p>That's it. You gotta bring the Green Man suit.</p>
<p>Yeah, no. Done with it.</p>
<p>The spandex.</p>
<p>Green Man was good. It got me through some hard times.</p>
<p>But I'm done with it. Tell you what. You can wear it if you want... but I'm just gonna be relaxing, okay?</p>
<p>This is gonna be about chilling out for me.</p>
<p>No. This is gonna be exactly like Woodstock. Oh, is it?</p>
<p>Are you planning on getting yourself locked in the bathroom... of your cousin's Winnebago for three days?</p>
<p>Shut up about that. I survived on hand soap... and toilet water for three days.</p>
<p>The memory haunts me.</p>
<p>The Linc, dude The Linc Yeah, baby.</p>
<p>I am actually gonna be able to look down and literally see how many yards I'm running.</p>
<p>This is gonna be awesome, dude. We might actually get... further in this little tryout than we thought. Yeah?</p>
<p>See how many yahoos are trying out? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of people wearing capes.</p>
<p>There are, like, 15 guys wearing capes. Why would you wear a cape?</p>
<p>What advantage does that give you? Absolutely none.</p>
<p>You know what? Have a little respect. We are here with the Philadelphia Eagles... and they are opening up their doors to us.</p>
<p>This is a boyhood dream.</p>
<p>I know. I know.</p>
<p>Why even come out here if you're not gonna take this somewhat seriously? I mean...</p>
<p>You done pissing yet? No. No.</p>
<p>I haven't even started pissing... because you're standing next to me, you're talking to me.</p>
<p>It's making me nervous, and I can't do my thing. All right. Want another beer?</p>
<p>Yeah. Give me another beer, for Christ sakes.</p>
<p>I'm gonna sit here and not drink another beer?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. Cabana is assembled. The grill is as sparkling as we're gonna get it.</p>
<p>The margarita machine here is open for business. Time to relax.</p>
<p>Want to drop some acid with me?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You're dropping acid?</p>
<p>Mmm. Woodstock, baby.</p>
<p>Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Uh, I believe that would have the complete opposite effect of relaxation for me.</p>
<p>Well, I'm gonna trip balls.</p>
<p>No. You messed up. It's too high.</p>
<p>It doesn't look right on you.</p>
<p>Too high? No, I'm good at it, dude. I did a good job on you.</p>
<p>That's 'cause I have good cheekbones. You have good cheekbones?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's 'cause you put foundation all over, bro.</p>
<p>I put a light base on just to... Hey, guys. What's up?</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>How's it hangin'?</p>
<p>This is a joke, right? You think anyone's gonna buy that?</p>
<p>Whatever, bro.</p>
<p>You're gonna get crushed.</p>
<p>Dee, the second any part of your body touches that field, it's gonna shatter like glass.</p>
<p>You got bones like glass. I don't have bones like glass.</p>
<p>You spent half your life in a back brace.</p>
<p>Your body's, like, 90% scoliosis, Dee.</p>
<p>Move it, fellas. Let's get on the bus.</p>
<p>Bus? What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>The bus that takes you to the field.</p>
<p>Wait. I thought we were gonna be playing on the Linc.</p>
<p>You think you dipshits are gonna play on the same field that champions play on?</p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>We're going to a shitty high school in Bucks County. Now get your ass on the bus.</p>
<p>If I say it one more time...</p>
<p>If I say it one more time...</p>
<p>If I say it one more time... Sprint to the bus. Sprint to the bus.</p>
<p>That's everyone on the bus, dude.</p>
<p>They're leaving. Maybe they're having the tryouts in a different place.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch. All right. Screw it, man. We're here. We'll just relax.</p>
<p>Stay here and look at the Linc?</p>
<p>Like a couple of dicks in a yard?</p>
<p>Get out of here!</p>
<p>We gotta get up and go.</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Let's go follow that bus. Come on.</p>
<p>All right. You get that. You get that.</p>
<p>Come on. Let's go. No, this is so much work.</p>
<p>Charlie, get up. This is work. I didn't want to...</p>
<p>Let's go. Get the stuff.</p>
<p>We'll follow the bus.</p>
<p>I like your mustache.</p>
<p>Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I can't grow one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That's a pretty sweet cape.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>My mom made it.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>She did a very good job.</p>
<p>Yeah. She's talented.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Can't believe we're not gonna be tearing it up on the Linc. This is bullshit.</p>
<p>Half the reason I wanted to do this in the first place was to be out on that field.</p>
<p>Hey, man. Stop smoking, will ya? Some of us are trying to make the team.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me, bro?</p>
<p>No. Guy, if you think you're actually going to make... the Philadelphia Eagles, then you're pathetic.</p>
<p>You're pathetic. No, you're pathetic, sport. No, you are You're pathetic!</p>
<p>You're pathetic!</p>
<p>You're the one who is pathetic! Whatever, man When I'm done with this tryout... you'll go back to your sad, pitiful life... and I'll be on the Eagles.</p>
<p>And everybody in Philadelphia will know the name McPoyle.</p>
<p>What'd you say your name is?</p>
<p>McPoyle.</p>
<p>Doyle McPoyle.</p>
<p>The unibrow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The eczema. The acne. He's definitely a McPoyle. There are so many of those people.</p>
<p>Now, this is what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>I don't know, dude.</p>
<p>Look at all the people.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we're stuck over here by the portable shitters, man. It's kinda lame.</p>
<p>Stop bitching and set up.</p>
<p>No. I'm not setting anything up, all right? I'm sitting in my chair.</p>
<p>I'm relaxing, I'm getting blackout drunk, and you're leaving me alone.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Be a party pooper.</p>
<p>What are you doing, dude? Taking more acid.</p>
<p>Classic mistake, Frank. You're making a classic mistake, bro.</p>
<p>Just shut up and sit in your stupid chair.</p>
<p>It's your funeral, buddy.</p>
<p>Just shut up.</p>
<p>Whoa! Hey there, guy.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa You kidding me, man?</p>
<p>What the hell is that shit? Man, that won't fly.</p>
<p>Come on, dude. You almost ran me... Oh, my God.</p>
<p>The McPoyle brothers.</p>
<p>Hello, Charles.</p>
<p>What the hell are you guys doing here?</p>
<p>We came to support our brother Doyle. He's gonna make the Eagles.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, that's fantastic.</p>
<p>Great. Whatever, man. That's great.</p>
<p>Yeah. Look... But your bus is spilling over into our space.</p>
<p>You almost ran me over, man.</p>
<p>Move it back. You gotta move it back a few feet.</p>
<p>No. No can do.</p>
<p>We need the space.</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>The whole family's here.</p>
<p>Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Great. Of course you're here. Good.</p>
<p>How many... What is that a jar of?</p>
<p>What is that a jar of, dude? What is... Pig parts.</p>
<p>How many can there possibly be?</p>
<p>Oh, good to see her again. Good.</p>
<p>She doesn't know what I'm saying, right? Okay. Here he comes.</p>
<p>Yeah. You're... You're here in the world. That's the sun.</p>
<p>It's gonna hurt your eyes. Watch your mouth. They've got thin corneas.</p>
<p>What is that? A fife? You brought your little flute.</p>
<p>Is there more? Are there any more? Get 'em all out.</p>
<p>All right. Look. I tell you what. Leave me alone, okay?</p>
<p>I don't care what you do. Just leave me alone.</p>
<p>'Cause, like, I'm here to relax and have a good time.</p>
<p>I don't want any of your shit.</p>
<p>All right? So leave me alone, okay?</p>
<p>We be cool.</p>
<p>We're even now.</p>
<p>Bump it.</p>
<p>I'm not bumping your fist.</p>
<p>Bump it.</p>
<p>Do it, Charlie. Bump it. I'm not bumping you, all right?</p>
<p>I never bumped him once! I'm not gonna bump him! Let's go, Charlie.</p>
<p>Whatever. No bumping. I just don't want... These guys are freak shows, man.</p>
<p>Hustle up! Let's go, bitches!</p>
<p>Let's move it!</p>
<p>Let's move it!</p>
<p>I was here first, Coach.</p>
<p>Hustle!</p>

<p>Coach! Hi. Hi, there.</p>
<p>Cole. Cole Armstrong.</p>
<p>Three time all-American. Fastest sprinter in five counties.</p>
<p>Coach, would you like us to stand when you address us, or do you prefer we take a knee?</p>
<p>I don't give a shit!</p>
<p>Okay. I'll take a knee.</p>
<p>Yeah. I'll take a knee.</p>
<p>We're doing these tryouts for you... because of your harassment and your love for the New Kids on the Block movie.</p>
<p>You paid your $30 fee. We promised you a keynote speaker.</p>
<p>All right. Bring him up.</p>
<p>McNabb, dude.</p>
<p>McNabb.</p>
<p>Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Uh, is this good here? Yeah, that's cool. Just put your parking brake on.</p>
<p>Donovan McNabb.</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>I'm Donovan McNabb.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>Uh, I play quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>And I'm here to tell you that you can, too... if you start every day with a hearty breakfast from McDonald's.</p>
<p>Uh, like the new Sausage Egg McGriddle Value Meal... available now for a limited time for under five dollars.</p>
<p>Remember, guys. Real champs eat at McDonald's.</p>
<p>I'm lovin' it.</p>
<p>Can I get the check?</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>Thanks, Donnie.</p>
<p>That was not Donovan McNabb!</p>
<p>That was not Donovan McNabb!</p>
<p>Yes, it was. It was like a McDonald's plug.</p>
<p>Was that the guy from The Cosby Show? That's not the guy from...</p>
<p>Yeah. He was married to Sondra. Alvin. Alvin.</p>
<p>That's awesome. They had Raven-Symoné. That's So Raven.</p>
<p>That's not the guy from...</p>
<p>You know what? Sprints!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Sprints!</p>
<p>Sprints!</p>
<p>Good job, dude.</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel it.</p>
<p>Mmm! I bet you are, bud.</p>
<p>Feeling weird. Yeah. You're probably feeling very weird.</p>
<p>The acid's making me feel like I gotta take a dump.</p>
<p>That's what happens when you take a lot of acid, dude. I gotta go.</p>
<p>Then go.</p>
<p>The line's too long.</p>
<p>Maybe I can hold it in.</p>
<p>Then go in the McPoyles' camper, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, no. That might bring back bad memories.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna hold it.</p>
<p>How you feeling?</p>
<p>Annoyed.</p>
<p>There's nothing kicking in yet?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>The beer? No. The acid.</p>
<p>I did not take any acid.</p>
<p>Remember?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you did.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I put a shitload of it in your beer.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that what all those little pieces of paper were floating... I drank all that shit, dude!</p>
<p>That's okay. There was, like, a ton of acid in there!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<p>I don't want to be the only one tripping. Oh, my God, man!</p>
<p>Charlie.</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>I actually really have to go take a dump. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Shut up. I don't care. Go to their camper.</p>
<p>I don't care, dude. Get out of here.</p>
<p>Oh, you sick son of a bitch, dude!</p>
<p>Why would you do...</p>
<p>Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</p>
<p>You ready to quit yet, Cole?</p>
<p>Yeah. You had enough yet, Cole?</p>
<p>Yeah, Cole! We ran for, like, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>My side is gonna explode. You guys are in terrible shape.</p>
<p>This is gonna be a lot easier than I thought.</p>
<p>Let's go! Let's go!</p>
<p>Move it!</p>
<p>I'm in so much pain.</p>
<p>All right. Now that we got our hearts pumping... let's pick out some gear, pick a partner... hitting drills!</p>
<p>I pick Cole!</p>
<p>Oh, no, he didn't!</p>
<p>Oh, no, he didn't!</p>
<p>That's my dance. That's my signature dance. Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do that when I tackle people. Yeah.</p>
<p>I like your form on that, and I liked how you went before the whistle.</p>
<p>Goddamn right.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>All right, guys.</p>
<p>Let's pick new partners.</p>
<p>Eeny, meeny... miny, mo.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You're up, man.</p>
<p>Ah. Uh, hitting's not really my thing, Coach.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true champion.</p>
<p>You just might make the team.</p>
<p>Awesome. Really?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank. That was easy. Now just exit.</p>
<p>Don't talk to anybody.</p>
<p>These people are freak shows.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait.</p>
<p>Better wash your hands.</p>
<p>No telling what kind of germs these McPoyles have.</p>
<p>Oh! Crap!</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel weird.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Oh, no. Not again.</p>
<p>Oh, no! Hey!</p>
<p>Hey! Hey! Hey! Somebody get me outta here!</p>
<p>Man, my brother just leveled your boy out there.</p>
<p>He's gonna make the Eagles.</p>
<p>Yeah, your boy's a pansy.</p>
<p>But Doyle's a big strong guy. It's probably 'cause he eats all that fish.</p>
<p>Is he just gonna talk at me? I am gonna lose my shit.</p>
<p>What is going on with his head?</p>
<p>It's too small or tight or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>His skin's too tight.</p>
<p>My skin's not tight.</p>
<p>Good catch, Doyle!</p>
<p>Good catch Way to hustle!</p>
<p>Way to hustle! All right.</p>
<p>Who's next? This guy.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Run out and hook in.</p>
<p>Run out and hook in. Show these people how to play football.</p>
<p>I'm gonna make Mac look so bad.</p>
<p>My form is perfect.</p>
<p>I'm like Jerry Rice.</p>
<p>Feel that stride.</p>
<p>So fluid and fast.</p>
<p>I've got the stride of a gazelle.</p>
<p>A beautiful, beautiful gazelle person.</p>
<p>My body is achieving a perfect symmetry right now.</p>
<p>It's that long, lean muscle I've worked so hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Hmm, I should've popped my shirt off. Goddamn it.</p>
<p>Really should've popped that shirt off.</p>
<p>I wonder if any women are watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p>All right, Dee. You can do this.</p>
<p>You can kick a football. You're better at sports than Mac and Dennis.</p>
<p>Holy shit!</p>
<p>The other coaches gotta hear about this.</p>
<p>Well, well, look who's a natural.</p>
<p>Guess I'll be getting further than you after all.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a lucky kick.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No. Those storklike legs... they act like pendulums.</p>
<p>And on the bottoms of those pendulums, feet like wrecking balls.</p>
<p>We gotta do something about this, dude.</p>
<p>Let's go talk to Frank.</p>
<p>Come on. I got an idea.</p>
<p>Somebody! Somebody help!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>Goddamn it! Not again!</p>
<p>Frank.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank.</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>I'm Artemis.</p>
<p>I'm Dee's friend.</p>
<p>I'm trapped.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But I can help.</p>
<p>Crawl into my mouth.</p>
<p>I don't think I can fit.</p>
<p>Mmm, sure you will. Just go one leg at a time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Into the toilet I go.</p>
<p>Man, this is crazy. You are dancing with the entire McRoyle family.</p>
<p>These people are freak shows, man. Freaks.</p>
<p>But you're keeping your cool.</p>
<p>You are keeping your cool.</p>
<p>You know why? Because you are the Green Man.</p>
<p>Green Man is saving your life right now, bro.</p>
<p>Just go with the flow.</p>
<p>Charlie, we've been looking all over for you, dude. Ah, Green Man.</p>
<p>I knew you couldn't resist.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You know what? I'm actually tripping pretty hard right now.</p>
<p>You're tripping?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Frank gave me some acid, and it's like... whoo! Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. Guess who got invited to training camp. Yeah. We're gonna be famous.</p>
<p>Look. We need to talk to Green Man alone for a second, please. Okay? Thank you. Yes. Bye.</p>
<p>Hey. Can we talk to the Green Man? Just go. Thank you. Can we... Guys mind...</p>
<p>Charlie, where's Frank? It's very important. Really important.</p>
<p>Oh, Frank?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He's standing right there.</p>
<p>Frank, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>He's been trying to climb through that trash can for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure he's on acid.</p>
<p>Thank God you guys are here. How'd you get in here?</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I've been stuck in this bathroom for three hours.</p>
<p>I think he took a dump in there.</p>
<p>Can you give us a second, please? Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm getting tired of watching him anyway.</p>
<p>All right. Frank, listen.</p>
<p>Did you bring your gun today?</p>
<p>Great. Walk me through the plan. Awesome.</p>
<p>The plan is, I get close to Dee.</p>
<p>When she goes to punt the ball, I'll fire the gun. It'll startle her.</p>
<p>She'll blow the kick.</p>
<p>That's a great plan.</p>
<p>Wait a second! How long have we been standing right here? Like two seconds.</p>
<p>Seriously? Yeah. Frank, give me the gun. We're in a hurry.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>It's in your hand.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait! When the hell did I put Green Man on?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>That lizard talks!</p>
<p>Where? Where?</p>
<p>I don't like lizards!</p>
<p>We don't have time for this. Frank, just give us the gun! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p>Lizard, am I standing in poop?</p>
<p>I'm about to demonstrate to all of you my natural abilities as a punter.</p>
<p>I'm gonna kick this ball 60 yards right in front of your faces... and I'm gonna do it... as a woman.</p>
<p>Oh, that's right. I'm a woman.</p>
<p>And I'm about to show all of you that women... should be allowed to try out for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Coach.</p>
<p>Wrap your minds around this.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, I broke it.</p>
<p>Oh, it may be broken.</p>
<p>Oh, sweet Jesus, I think I broke it.</p>
<p>Kick your legs, man. Come on. All right, Frank. You're out of the trash can.</p>
<p>Now a deal is a deal. Give us the gun. Hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>I'm really peaking here.</p>
<p>Stop pointing the gun at us! Stop pointing it at us!</p>
<p>Point it somewhere else. Nobody minds if I do a little dancing now, do they?</p>
<p>Nobody cares if you're dancing, Charlie. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Could somebody please take me to the hospital, because I'm pretty sure...</p>
<p>I broke every single bone in my foot punting that football. Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. I didn't make the Eagles, but I would like to go to the emergency room now, please.</p>
<p>So your bones are made out of glass. Yes! Nice.</p>
<p>No, my bones aren't... Know what? It doesn't matter, because I made the furthest, so I win.</p>
<p>No, I win because you're the girl, and you got knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>You didn't win. You got crushed. Once again! Yes!</p>
<p>That is so stupid. Guess what. I made it the farthest.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes!</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You shattered every...</p>
<p>Holy shit. This thing is loaded.</p>
<p>My leg!</p>
<p>Doyle, are you okay?</p>
<p>My leg!</p>
<p>Somebody shot my leg!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Oh, that's not good.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>No. That could come back and bite us in the ass. That's not a good thing.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
