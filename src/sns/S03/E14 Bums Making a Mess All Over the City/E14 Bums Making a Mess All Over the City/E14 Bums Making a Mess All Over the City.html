<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There's a masturbating bum in the alley. He's masturbating.</p>
<p>Yeah. I know about that guy.</p>
<p>masturbating bums are bad for business.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I saw that guy's wiener.</p>
<p>He's gonna rip it off one of these days. It's disgusting.</p>
<p>It really is. This whole goddamn neighborhood is going to shit.</p>
<p>There is a deteriorating situation here, and we gotta do something about it.</p>
<p>We should get a junkyard dog. Okay?</p>
<p>A really mean, nasty junkyard dog.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>We'll chain him up in the alley.</p>
<p>We'll scare away the bums. That's it.</p>
<p>Charlie, it's not just about our alley.</p>
<p>It's about this whole neighborhood.</p>
<p>I think we should make this whole neighborhood safe again. Yeah.</p>
<p>Kind of leaning towards the junkyard dog idea. You like the dog idea?</p>
<p>I'd go for a dog.</p>
<p>Now, first order of business... is thanking Jean for working so hard... on our monthly crime watch newsletter.</p>
<p>Uh, do you have a question?</p>
<p>Yeah. New to the crew.</p>
<p>Uh, quick question about the uniform situation.</p>
<p>Now, I like to cut my sleeves off. It's kind of my look.</p>
<p>So I'm wondering if the tailor is provided for us, or I'm left to my own devices.</p>
<p>We don't have uniforms.</p>
<p>Now, but... Yes?</p>
<p>Yeah. Will you be providing the weapons?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh! I get it. Okay.</p>
<p>We go buy the weapons.</p>
<p>We tell you how much we spent, and you reimburse us. Great.</p>
<p>It doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>You gotta give him a receipt.</p>
<p>Oh, I would make a copy of the receipt. You give them the original.</p>
<p>I would give them the original and I would keep the copy? That seems stupid.</p>
<p>That's how reimbursement works. If something happens to the weapons, I'm shit out of luck?</p>
<p>You just ask 'em for the original back. I'm sure they got a system.</p>
<p>Why would they keep the original?</p>
<p>I'm the one that bought the gun.</p>
<p>Oh, it's a gun now. It's always been a gun, Dee.</p>
<p>Excuse me. Hi. Hi. We don't carry weapons.</p>
<p>We're just a neighborhood watch.</p>
<p>Wait. So you people don't apprehend criminals?</p>
<p>If we see anything suspicious, we call the police.</p>
<p>The police? The police.</p>
<p>The streets are flooded with the ejaculate of the homeless... and you people are counting on the police?</p>
<p>Clearly we are gonna have to handle this ourselves, Dee.</p>
<p>You, sir, have wasted my time, and the time of my associate.</p>
<p>Dee, get my coat.</p>
<p>You hear barking?</p>
<p>I don't hear no dogs. They'll run out and bite you in the nuts.</p>
<p>They're probably sleepin'. You don't wanna wake 'em. Probably chained up.</p>
<p>I don't hear a dog.</p>
<p>We'll ask this guy.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir. Where am I finding your junkyard dogs?</p>
<p>My what?</p>
<p>We wanna buy a junkyard dog.</p>
<p>We want the most vicious one you have. Yeah, a really nasty dog.</p>
<p>Really nasty dog.</p>
<p>We don't have no dogs.</p>
<p>What...</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Is this not a junkyard?</p>
<p>You don't have a dog?</p>
<p>We got a cat round here somewhere.</p>
<p>Cat?</p>
<p>We don't... We don't want a cat. Walt a minute.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. Believe me, that's a tough cat.</p>
<p>It was born in a pool of gasoline, on a piece of rusty scrap metal.</p>
<p>I've seen that cat jump through barbed wire... into a vat of hot tar.</p>
<p>That cat...</p>
<p>Is indestructible.</p>
<p>We don't want no cat. Great.</p>
<p>It's a cat. We want a dog.</p>
<p>Well, now, wait a second. I wouldn't mind taking a look at that cat.</p>
<p>Come on, dude. What are we gonna do with a cat? Whoa.</p>
<p>Go ahead. Knock yourself out. Is that a cop car?</p>
<p>You guys, if we park that in front of Paddy's, no more bums.</p>
<p>No problems, period.</p>
<p>Is that old cop car for sale? Everything's for sale.</p>
<p>We'll take it.</p>
<p>And throw in that cat.</p>
<p>This thing's cool, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's very cool.</p>
<p>The seating's a little tight.</p>
<p>The seating is very tight.</p>
<p>It's cramped.</p>
<p>Well, I know it's cramped.</p>
<p>Maybe if a certain someone didn't buy a certain something... there'd be a little bit more room up here.</p>
<p>This guy's not the problem. This guy's not the problem. You're the problem.</p>
<p>I'm the problem, dude?</p>
<p>You're the problem.</p>
<p>Why don't you jump in the back? I called shotgun. You have to get in the back.</p>
<p>I wanna fiddle with all the gadgets. Fool with 'em.</p>
<p>Why are we stopped?</p>
<p>Yeah, why are we stopped?</p>
<p>It's a red light.</p>
<p>We're in a cop car.</p>
<p>Make 'er sing.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>We look so stupid.</p>
<p>We look awesome. Throw that on.</p>
<p>I'm not putting on a beret. Gotta wear the beret.</p>
<p>It's terrible, and I don't get the point. It sends a message, Dee.</p>
<p>The Guardian Angels wore the same, exact outfit... when they cleaned up the streets of New York City in the 1970s.</p>
<p>We look like Rerun. You know what I hear when you talk like that?</p>
<p>A scared little girl who's never had anyone fear her.</p>
<p>Fear is power, Dee.</p>
<p>Don't you get that?</p>
<p>It's like a drug. Once you get a taste of it, you can never get enough.</p>
<p>If I promise to wear this stupid thing, will you stop talking?</p>
<p>Absolutely. All right. Let's roll.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>That's my mini bat.</p>
<p>You're gonna hit that bum?</p>
<p>No, I'm not gonna hit anybody.</p>
<p>That's the best part about fear and intimidation, Dee.</p>
<p>All you gotta do is look the part.</p>
<p>Now what do you think about these suspenders?</p>
<p>All right, you ready?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess so.</p>
<p>Let's clean up the streets.</p>
<p>This is how it's gonna work.</p>
<p>You're gonna walk right up to him.</p>
<p>You're gonna kindly ask him to leave.</p>
<p>He's gonna see me with the bat, looking tough.</p>
<p>He's gone.</p>
<p>That's it?</p>
<p>That's all you need to do when you look like a badass, Dee.</p>
<p>That's not gonna work.</p>
<p>Yes, It will.</p>
<p>Oh, Mac, I can hear It.</p>
<p>Come on. He's smiling at me.</p>
<p>All right, give me the bat.</p>
<p>You know what, asshole?</p>
<p>You like that, bitch? Huh?</p>
<p>I am not your little pinup girl... for you to tug your rotten pecker at!</p>
<p>Go on, get out of here.</p>
<p>You're one crazy bitch.</p>
<p>I don't wanna see you or your dirty balls in my alley again!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you took my bat.</p>
<p>I kicked that guy's ass.</p>
<p>I would have helped you. I need my bat back.</p>
<p>That was awesome. Okay, that was, but next time just don't take my bat.</p>
<p>Heyo! Freeze, punk.</p>
<p>Cool, huh? Gonna ride around In a cop car, can't do It In street clothes.</p>
<p>People'll think you stole it.</p>
<p>That's awesome. Where's mine?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Uh, well, Charlie, these things cost me a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Yeah, Frank really sprung for all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>You shittin' me?</p>
<p>You didn't get me one?</p>
<p>You guys know how I love dressing up in costumes. Dude, that's bullshit.</p>
<p>Charlie, you can't have three guys dressed in cop suits... in the front seat of a cop car.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It don't look right. Plus we need room for Agent Bauer.</p>
<p>Well, who's Agent Bauer?</p>
<p>Oh, come on. You're gonna let the stupid junkyard cat ride up front?</p>
<p>It smells like it's been dumped in a bucket of piss. Hey, hey, hey, hey.</p>
<p>Do not refer to him as a junkyard cat.</p>
<p>He has a name... Agent Jack Bauer.</p>
<p>Come on, I don't wanna ride around in the back seat. Charlie...</p>
<p>You can be disguised as an undercover cop in the back seat.</p>
<p>Yeah, dude. Then you can wear all the disguises you want.</p>
<p>Damn it! That is such a good idea.</p>
<p>No one's gonna know, dude. I'm gonna be, like, "You're busted.</p>
<p>Hello. How ya doin'?</p>
<p>You're busted. "</p>
<p>All right, let's get you back to C.T.U., Agent Bauer.</p>
<p>ho!</p>
<p>Over here, pal.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Boys in blue.</p>
<p>What's shakin', pal?</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>
<p>Hey, you fellas hungry? Couple my best dogs, on the house.</p>
<p>That sounds like the move.</p>
<p>Yeah, you boys cruise in one of the old models, huh?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. This is a place of junk.</p>
<p>They're cuttin' back. The brass is breakin' our balls.</p>
<p>Say, what'd this guy do? We caught him diddling kids over at a playground.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's a perv. We're gonna bust him up good.</p>
<p>You just go and get us a couple of those tasty dogs.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Let me see what I can do, huh?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Holy shit, that actually worked. These uniforms are gonna pay for themselves 10 times over.</p>
<p>You're brilliant, man. You know what else I realized?</p>
<p>They didn't even realize I was an undercover cop. Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna become Al Pacino in Serpico.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be Al Pacino... Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Get in there. You're gonna ruin it.</p>
<p>Hey, hey. Here you go, boys.</p>
<p>You keep up the good work.</p>
<p>All righty. Thanks, pal.</p>
<p>I got a great Serpico costume.</p>
<p>Diddle, diddle, diddle.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's...</p>
<p>It's really something else.</p>
<p>I don't care. Get in the car.</p>
<p>Don't push my head like that. Let's go, Frank.</p>
<p>Dennis, do you have to take that cat everywhere we go? Yeah. He's awesome.</p>
<p>Have you taken a good look at this guy? He's hilarious.</p>
<p>It's a mangy cat.</p>
<p>I don't like the cat.</p>
<p>Serpico doesn't like the cat one bit. I don't give a shit, Charlie...</p>
<p>'cause you're not Serpico.</p>
<p>I'm goin' on record.</p>
<p>We gotta get rid of that cat. It stinks.</p>
<p>Stinkin' cat. We're not gettin' rid of the cat.</p>
<p>There's nothing you guys can do. The cat outranks you.</p>
<p>I'm not outranked by a cat. Oh, yeah, you are.</p>
<p>Cat's a special agent.</p>
<p>Are you a special agent?</p>
<p>Here's a special agent over there. Look at this guy here.</p>
<p>He's jaywalking. Take it easy, Charlie. Take it easy.</p>
<p>No, no. Back me up here.</p>
<p>I'm goin' in. Hey, guy!</p>
<p>Charlie, where you goin'? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Hello, guy! Hello! You wanna stop for a second?</p>
<p>You like just crossin' the street whenever you want, makin' up your own laws?</p>
<p>I'm sorry... You ought to be sorry. You just jaywalked, buddy.</p>
<p>You gonna give me a ticket? That depends on how much money you got in your wallet.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Like, 15 bucks, I guess.</p>
<p>Fork it over.</p>
<p>And the watch.</p>
<p>You're serious? Do I look like I'm smiling? Are we smiling?</p>
<p>I can't believe this is happening. Believe it, buddy.</p>
<p>Gimme your watch. Come on.</p>
<p>Take a walk.</p>
<p>Get out of here. Yeah, get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Useless. Put an egg in your shoe and beat it.</p>
<p>What the hell was that shit right there?</p>
<p>Huh? We got 15 bucks. We got 15 bucks. Here, take your cut.</p>
<p>I don't want a cut. You don't take your cut, how do we know how to trust you?</p>
<p>That's dirty money.</p>
<p>Look, guys, we're cops.</p>
<p>All right? We're not out here to bribe people.</p>
<p>Will you stop doing that stupid voice? What are you doin'?</p>
<p>I told you I was gonna do Pacino.</p>
<p>You sound like an asshole. Well, you guys are taking bribes now.</p>
<p>That's bullshit. I'm walkin'. Oh, you're gonna do Christopher Walken now?</p>
<p>I'm not doing Christopher Walken.</p>
<p>I'm walking from the situation.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Go on. Go on.</p>

<p>You guys are crooked cops, and I don't like it.</p>
<p>The kid's nuts. He's an idiot. Gimme my cut.</p>
<p>Here's five bucks.</p>
<p>Gimme that.</p>
<p>I'll take the 10.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm keepin' the watch.</p>
<p>Keep the watch.</p>
<p>I'm going to.</p>
<p>Watch out for the cars.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Hey! Hold it.</p>
<p>Hey, toots. Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Can I help you? The real question is, can we help you?</p>
<p>See, my partner and I have been cleaning up the streets the past couple days.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p>We know how the system works. You guys can't get your hands dirty. We're not afraid of that.</p>
<p>Getting physical... That's not a problem for us. We are all on the same team.</p>
<p>Okay? So if you could fast track us through... like, a citizen deputy type program...</p>
<p>Yeah, and, you know, toss us a couple of badges.</p>
<p>You know, make it all legal.</p>
<p>We can work together on this.</p>
<p>Well, let's see. Oh! You know what? I'm fresh out of badges.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I see what you did.</p>
<p>See, I sense your sarcasm.</p>
<p>I'm used to it. Okay?</p>
<p>Let me just say... Doesn't help, and I don't appreciate it.</p>
<p>It just hurts my feelings, because we are sticking our necks out for you guys... and, frankly, doing your job better than you are. Really? I tell you what.</p>
<p>I do know of a neighborhood that could use your help.</p>
<p>Perfect. Where?</p>
<p>Davis? Leroy?</p>
<p>These two Guardian Angels would love to help you clean up your beat.</p>
<p>Okay, gentlemen, thank you for the ride.</p>
<p>Quick question. What time are you picking us up?</p>
<p>No, no, no. Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Well, we're screwed. No, Dee, Dee, Dee. Relax, okay?</p>
<p>So we are in a lower socioeconomic, African American neighborhood.</p>
<p>Yes, we are, but that's okay. That's okay.</p>
<p>We're Guardian Angels.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>We're tough, right?</p>
<p>We're tough.</p>
<p>Okay! Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Stop doing that.</p>
<p>Guardian Angels, right?</p>
<p>We're Guardian Angels, blind to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>We can do this.</p>
<p>We are gonna make these streets safe...</p>
<p>We are gonna make these streets safe. Everything is gonna...</p>
<p>That was a gunshot.</p>
<p>We're gonna die here.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>Let's find a guy and figure out where the bus stop is.</p>
<p>He seems safe. Let's ask him. He seems nice.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir. Oh, thank God we found you.</p>
<p>We are in a very rough neighborhood, and we are lost.</p>
<p>Could you please direct us to the nearest bus stop?</p>
<p>How you doin'?</p>
<p>Uh, hi. How are ya?</p>
<p>I'm good. I'm good.</p>
<p>You movin' in soon?</p>
<p>Pardon me?</p>
<p>You've been loitering on this corner for the last 20 minutes... like you own the goddamn place.</p>
<p>I don't think I follow you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? Don't get cute with me, pal.</p>
<p>I will jam you up so hard. I will jam you from morning until night.</p>
<p>You wanna get jammed up? Huh?</p>
<p>You like gettin' jammed up? No. No.</p>
<p>No. I didn't think so.</p>
<p>Good. Gimme that wallet.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go. Come on.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What do we got here?</p>
<p>Oh. Time to hit the A.T.M., huh?</p>
<p>So I'll have five hot dogs. I want you to mash one of' em up in a bowl.</p>
<p>Put some milk or some water, you know?</p>
<p>Mash it up nice and good, but, you know, four regulars, five hot dogs altogether.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but no more free hot dogs.</p>
<p>I mean, look, maybe if it was just you I could swing it... but it's you, your partner, and now I'm feedin' your cat?</p>
<p>I just can't afford it.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Oh. Where are our hot dogs?</p>
<p>He won't cough up the hot dogs.</p>
<p>This goddamn cat is screwin' up everything.</p>
<p>We gotta get rid of the cat, Dennis.</p>
<p>Tough titties, pal. I'm not gettin' rid of the cat. Tough titties?</p>
<p>Yeah, tough titties. Dennis, this thing with the cat has gone too far.</p>
<p>I'm puttin' my foot down. It's gonna be either the cat or me.</p>
<p>Okay, I choose the cat. All right, then I'm takin' the badge.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'? Are you crazy? Get out of here.</p>
<p>Hey, I bought that badge, I bought this uniform and I bought that cop car.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit. I'm gonna tell you something, buddy.</p>
<p>Your days as a cop of this town are over.</p>
<p>You and that mangy cat.</p>
<p>This is a stinkin', dirty hellhole of a town.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna clean it up.</p>
<p>Let's do this thing.</p>
<p>See, now I feel very powerless. I don't like it.</p>
<p>I would like to beat somebody up so I could feel better.</p>
<p>You try to do something good, and you get nothing in return.</p>
<p>What is the point?</p>
<p>Respect. Reward.</p>
<p>Compensation for a job well done.</p>
<p>What's with the cat?</p>
<p>Don't start in on the cat.</p>
<p>I swear to God, I will jam you into the middle of next week.</p>
<p>We will jam and jam and jam until there is nothing left of the two of you to jam.</p>
<p>Do you understand what we're saying to you? Not really.</p>
<p>Calm down, dude. All right, here's the situation.</p>
<p>Frank and I got our hands on a cop car. We were cruisin' around in it.</p>
<p>We were actin' like cops.</p>
<p>Everything was goin' great, but then it got to Frank's head... and he squeezed me out.</p>
<p>You two have not begun to feel the power and respect that you get... when you are cruising around in a cop car.</p>
<p>See, we've been cleaning up the streets, and all we've gotten is mugged.</p>
<p>You deserve better than that.</p>
<p>We deserve better than that.</p>
<p>So here's what we gotta do.</p>
<p>We gotta get rid of Frank.</p>
<p>We gotta get our hands on that cop car.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. I'm in.</p>
<p>What's the plan? All right.</p>
<p>Frank's got beef with a certain hot dog vendor... and I was thinkin', if something bad... were to happen to one of his carts...</p>
<p>Well, we could put the frame on Frank.</p>
<p>Really get him into some trouble. Right, Jack?</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>What'd you say, Charlie?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>You just said something.</p>
<p>No, I was, uh... I think you said, "bingo. "</p>
<p>Stop playing with your stupid tape recorder. Go clean those bathrooms.</p>
<p>That's not a...</p>
<p>Charlie, clean the bathroom.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>That right there is a tale of corruption and intrigue... the likes of which are gonna rock this city.</p>
<p>"Spin Doctors mix"? I taped over the Spin Doctors mix.</p>
<p>Sir, I do not have time to listen to your mix tape. No, it's not a m...</p>
<p>Look, uh, I'm ready to blow my whistle here.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying? I got a laundry list of corruption charges...</p>
<p>Extortion, bribery, junkyard cats.</p>
<p>This is nasty, heavy stuff. Now, you gonna listen to this tape or not?</p>
<p>No, I am not.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>You're one of them, huh?</p>
<p>A crooked cop.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it!</p>
<p>Everybody's a crooked cop, huh?</p>
<p>Am I the only cop left in Philadelphia who ain't crooked? Oh...</p>
<p>Oh, I see what's happening.</p>
<p>You wanna come at Serpico, huh?</p>
<p>Who wants a place of Serpico?</p>
<p>'Cause I'll give It to you.</p>
<p>I'll give a piece, 'cause you're forgetting about this.</p>
<p>And you're forgetting about... whatever the hell that is.</p>
<p>But you're forgetting about it.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna take this right to the mayor, and you're gonna remember.</p>
<p>We really gotta do something about these homeless people.</p>
<p>That kitty is really loving this Molotov cocktail.</p>
<p>ho, ho, ho there, Jack. That's not a toy.</p>
<p>He's slurping down that gasoline no problem. What's the deal with that?</p>
<p>Yeah, he's got a thing for gasoline.</p>
<p>He was born in a pool of it.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Just stopped in for a cold beer... to enjoy with my free hot dog.</p>
<p>You parked in a red zone.</p>
<p>I'm gonna let it fly this time, but be careful.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks, Frank. I appreciate that. I'll take care of it.</p>
<p>Yeah. In fact, Special Agent Bauer and I... intend to take care of a few things today.</p>
<p>Oh, hey there, guys. What's goin' on, huh?</p>
<p>Up to no good? A little crime and corruption?</p>
<p>I hope you guys don't mind if I borrow this.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Charlie, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Charlie, where you going? Oh, you know where I'm going, Frank.</p>
<p>Charlie, drop your weapon. Don't do that.</p>
<p>What are you doing? I'm putting an end to this, is what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Charlie...</p>
<p>We were supposed to be cops.</p>
<p>We were supposed to care about justice, and it got to your head.</p>
<p>I'll get a hose. That's not gonna do any good.</p>
<p>I doused the whole car full of gasoline.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Goddamn It, Jack Bauer.</p>
<p>You really are the man.</p>
<p>Okay, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p>Feast your ears on that Spin Doctors mix.</p>
<p>Hooah!</p>
