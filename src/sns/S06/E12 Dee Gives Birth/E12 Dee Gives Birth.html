<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Look what Charlie and I found.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Get that way from me.</p>
<p>It reeks!</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Dude, this is our mail!</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>It's our mail and it was in the sewer!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: What was our mail doing in the sewer?</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Dee</strong>: I threw it in there.</p>
<p>You turkeys never open it, so I just started throwing it in the sewer.</p>
<p>Why don't you just throw it into the trash?</p>
<p>Because if I threw it in the trash, you would find it and then you would yell at me.</p>
<p>Besides, I certainly never expected you guys to be rooting around in the sewer.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>That brings up another issue.</p>
<p>What are you two doing in the sewer?</p>
<p>We always go in the sewer.</p>
<p>Yeah, we hang out in the sewer.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There's stuff down there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, man, don't knock the sewer till you've tried the sewer.</p>
<p>You find all kinds of shit down there.</p>
<p>But how are you so clean?</p>
<p>We take our clothes off so we don't get dirty.</p>
<p>You guys!</p>
<p>Okay, hang on a second, Dee.</p>
<p>We're getting into something here.</p>
<p>Anything could be down there.</p>
<p>It could be big stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah. Rings, coins, nudity.</p>
<p>That's all part of the fun.</p>
<p>All kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>The two of you are walking around in the sewers naked, looking for rings and coins?</p>
<p>You feel it with your feet.</p>
<p>It's almost like clamming.</p>
<p>You mash around with your feet?</p>
<p>Okay, but, you guys!</p>
<p>Oh, Dee, would you just knock it off?</p>
<p>I want to know why these two are rooting around in the sewer...</p>
<p>My water just broke!</p>
<p>Drain could... what?</p>
<p>I'm having a baby.</p>
<p>(door slams open)</p>
<p>Out of my way.</p>
<p>I've broken my water.</p>
<p>There's a baby inside of me running out of water!</p>
<p>Dennis, that was amazing, dude.</p>
<p>I've never seen anybody drive that fast.</p>
<p>You hit 120, 120!</p>
<p>I almost stewed my drawers.</p>
<p>She was screaming in my ear the whole time, probably screwed my transmission up.</p>
<p>Nice and easy, here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>This is my ride.</p>
<p>They've done this before.</p>
<p>Thank you. All done with you.</p>
<p>You can go.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Where's the guy?</p>
<p>Should we call the guy?</p>
<p>Get the guy down here?</p>
<p>The guy.</p>
<p>The guy who...</p>
<p>Oh, no, no. That guy.</p>
<p>There's no guy.</p>
<p>What do you mean, there's no guy?</p>
<p>There's no guy.</p>
<p>It's complicated.</p>
<p>There's got to be a guy.</p>
<p>We'll go get the guy!</p>
<p>We'll get the dad!</p>
<p>There's no guy, okay?</p>
<p>Why don't you guys do what you do best and don't care, okay?</p>
<p>I got it from here.</p>
<p>We can take it from here, right, Michael?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Michael and I got it.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Kind of rude, but, uh, I guess if we're off the hook, let's head back to the bar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could get blitzed.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Wait.</p>
<p>Stop, guys.</p>
<p>No, this is not right.</p>
<p>Something is not right here.</p>
<p>This is very suspicious.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There's no guy in the picture?</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Well, you know what this means, right?</p>
<p>There's no dad in the picture.</p>
<p>That means the brunt of the responsibility of this kid is going to fall on us.</p>
<p>We're going to have to do everything.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>Dee is, like, the most irresponsible person on the planet.</p>
<p>I mean, look what she was doing with the mail, for Christ sakes!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>We're going to be in charge of the kid?</p>
<p>No, this kid cannot become our responsibility.</p>
<p>I mean, look what this kid has ruined already.</p>
<p>He's ruined my transmission.</p>
<p>He's ruined a perfectly good sewer conversation.</p>
<p>I still want to get to the bottom of that one.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p>God knows what he's going to ruin in the future.</p>
<p>He is going to ruin everything!</p>
<p>We got to find the dad!</p>
<p>We got to find that dad!</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>We should find the dad.</p>
<p>Let's find the dad.</p>
<p>The dad's responsible.</p>
<p>Let's find the dad.</p>
<p>Let's find the dad.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I wonder if the dad even knows.</p>
<p>I'll bet she's embarrassed.</p>
<p>Too embarrassed to tell us because she's bedded some real stinkers.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>She might not even know, herself.</p>
<p>No, well, there's always overlap.</p>
<p>Any multiple number of-of sperms could have gone up there and eaten the egg.</p>
<p>There could be so many dads.</p>
<p>No, sperm doesn't eat the egg.</p>
<p>It doesn't eat the egg and grow strong and become a baby?</p>
<p>By the way, she's pregnant and it's a guy, so let's get him.</p>
<p>Let's find the guy.</p>
<p>Why don't we just round up the usual suspects, and then we'll figure out how many of them...</p>
<p>Somebody's got to stay here with her.</p>
<p>Oh, you think so?</p>
<p>You're right, you're right.</p>
<p>It should be...</p>
<p>Oh, it looks like it's going to be you.</p>
<p>Why? What happened?</p>
<p>Well, mostly because, you know, we're all on this side and you're over there.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Just because you guys made it to one side?</p>
<p>You didn't make it to the side on time.</p>
<p>Also, now we're backing out, and you're kind of stuck there.</p>
<p>I can back out.</p>
<p>Hey, we'll find the dad.</p>
<p>You better find that dad.</p>
<p>This is not fair.</p>
<p>Just keep your eye on her.</p>
<p>(Thumping and creaking)</p>
<p>What-what are you doing?</p>
<p>What-what are you doing?</p>
<p>Get down!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make the tv go.</p>
<p>You are standing on top of a rolling chair.</p>
<p>You're going to go flying through that window for God sakes.</p>
<p>Will you get down?</p>
<p>I'm serious.</p>
<p>You get down, Dee.</p>
<p>All right, all right, all right, all right.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>What are you thinking?</p>
<p>Well, I'm trying to watch my stories, okay?</p>
<p>I have a very specific birth plan and mostly it involves me watching my stories to relax, but I can't get this goddamn tv to do anything.</p>
<p>What are you... are you...</p>
<p>Knock it off!</p>
<p>I'm mad at the...</p>
<p>Stop straining yourself.</p>
<p>Go lie down.</p>
<p>Lie down now.</p>
<p>(Groans)</p>
<p>God, this is exactly what I was worried about, Dee.</p>
<p>You see, I am going to have to do everything because you are an irresponsible person who stands atop rolling chairs and chooses to go flying through windows.</p>
<p>Have the baby first.</p>
<p>Have the stupid baby, then go flying through all the windows you like.</p>
<p>Oh, my...</p>
<p>Just lie there.</p>
<p>Wait for the doctor.</p>
<p>I will get your stories.</p>
<p>(Sighs)</p>
<p>God, this baby is becoming such an irritating thing to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>God, what an irritating thing babies are.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I'll figure you out, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>(Party music playing)</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p>Where is everybody?</p>
<p>I thought this was supposed to be a party.</p>
<p>They'll be here.</p>
<p>You're early.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: Do you have anything to drink?</p>
<p>The salt on the chips dries out my mouth.</p>
<p>I'll poke around the fridge and see if there's anything.</p>
<p>Where's the beer?</p>
<p>I forgot the beer.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You didn't bring the beer?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to know this is a party if there's no beer?</p>
<p>Well, I got wrapped up in the invitations.</p>
<p>It's a party with no beer.</p>
<p>We don't want them thinking it's an interrogation.</p>
<p>Well, you give him a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>Cricket</strong>: Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Party, party!</p>
<p>All right. Hey!</p>
<p>Hey, crick.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Where the booze at?</p>
<p>What's up, fellas?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Who invited cricket?</p>
<p>I did, because I figured it's a wild card.</p>
<p>That's a stone you can leave unturned. I mean...</p>
<p>We don't have time for that bullshit.</p>
<p>We got to get on this, all right?</p>
<p>Let's just pick one and go.</p>
<p>Hey, uh, bill?</p>
<p>Can we talk to you for a sec, maybe, uh, in this room?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>A little guy time.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Guy time.</p>
<p>Right, let's turn it up.</p>
<p>(Music blasting)</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Let's get weird, buddy.</p>
<p>Let's get weird.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to the party, bill.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me, guys, you know?</p>
<p>It's good to get away from the wife and kids for a little bit, you know?</p>
<p>Let the hair down.</p>
<p>So you're still with your wife after all that shit with Dee?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I realized I was a sex addict.</p>
<p>I went to therapy.</p>
<p>She forgave me for it.</p>
<p>Oh, you're a sex addict, huh?</p>
<p>That's crazy to be one of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don't mind if I write some of this down, do you?</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>Just keeping a log of the party.</p>
<p>We like to do that.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, a funny conversation pops up, you want to remember it.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Speaking of parties, you guys want to do a little... (Sniffs)</p>
<p>Is that coke?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I picked up a couple grams on the way over.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe a little bit later, we can all partake.</p>
<p>But for now, you know, we're just-just a bunch of guys hanging out in a room.</p>
<p>You know, dudes.</p>
<p>(Laughs)</p>
<p>Let's talk about dude stuff.</p>
<p>I like dude stuff, yeah.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Let's think about, like, uh, what do guys talk about?</p>
<p>condom!</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the feel of a condom on my dick.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I hate condom.</p>
<p>Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the three of us just don't use 'em.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<p>No, me neither.</p>
<p>No, I can't stand them.</p>
<p>Well, that's interesting.</p>
<p>A sex addict who doesn't like condom.</p>
<p>That's why I had a vasectomy, guys.</p>
<p>You had a vasectomy?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You just winked when you said that.</p>
<p>Did you have a vasectomy or not?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>(Laughs)</p>
<p>But that's what I would tell the ladies, so I didn't have to wear a condom.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, man!</p>
<p>That is incredibly shady.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>What a beautiful underhanded thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's disgusting.</p>
<p>Very underhanded.</p>
<p>You guys want to do a bump or what?</p>
<p>I'll have a bump.</p>
<p>I don't understand why there's not a single room in this hospital...</p>
<p>Well, I don't know where...</p>
<p>That has a working television.</p>
<p>I want it, I want that room, I want it now.</p>
<p>I don't know where you think I'm gonna get it from.</p>
<p>I don't have any.</p>
<p>If you do not get my sister her stories and a new room as soon as possible, then I will come down on this hospital like the hammer of Thor.</p>
<p>The thunder of my vengeance will echo through these corridors like the dust of a thousand winds!</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I don't have time for this.</p>
<p>I ain't going to jail over you.</p>
<p>I will beat your ass and think nothing of it.</p>
<p>I'm not doing this with you today.</p>
<p>I'm not. I'm not!</p>
<p>What's the word on my stories?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Why are you not in bed?</p>
<p>Oh, I slipped out for a quick sandwich and a soda.</p>
<p>You left the hospital?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was kind of hungry.</p>
<p>Mostly, I was just getting bored.</p>
<p>You know what I mean...?</p>
<p>Dee, get in your room!</p>
<p>You're drive... I-I...</p>
<p>It's so boring.</p>
<p>There's nothing going on in there.</p>
<p>You get in your room. You get in your room!</p>
<p>Get in here. Get in there.</p>
<p>The lighting, and don't push me, though, because I'm pregnant, and I don't...</p>
<p>Get in the bed. Get in bed.</p>
<p>Wait a sec. What's this?</p>
<p>What? I don't know.</p>
<p>Why is there a strange man in my room?</p>
<p>They probably slid this man in here, thinking that you were never gonna use the room, so...</p>
<p>Well, that's no good.</p>
<p>I don't want there to be a strange man laying in my room who looks dead.</p>
<p>Is he dead? Dennis, is he dead?</p>
<p>I'm sure he's just sleeping, Dee.</p>
<p>Get-get in bed.</p>
<p>I'm gonna scream his face and see if he wakes up.</p>
<p>Do not scream in the man's face.</p>
<p>I'll jiggle his ankle, and that will determine whether he's alive or not.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir, are you...?</p>
<p>Well, you're very cold.</p>
<p>He's very cold. Okay.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, you!</p>
<p>You, wake up right now if you're not dead.</p>
<p>All right, damn it, Dee, stop.</p>
<p>Oh, God, I think he's dead.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think he's dead, Dennis.</p>
<p>He's definitely dead.</p>
<p>Oh, why would they do that?</p>
<p>Why would they put a dead old man with paper skin in my room when I'm trying to give birth?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Because you weren't using the room, Dee, and the hospital is very full.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, well, this was not part of my birth plan.</p>
<p>This was not part of my birth plan, sir.</p>
<p>Get the nurse.</p>
<p>Get the nurse and get him out.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>Getting the nurse is not going to do any good.</p>
<p>That woman is stubborn as shit.</p>
<p>Well, do something.</p>
<p>You ought to do something, 'cause this is upsetting me.</p>
<p>All right! All right!</p>
<p>And it's upsetting the baby.</p>
<p>I hate all the responsibility that I have that this baby is causing me.</p>
<p>Yes, I will get this man out of your room; I will think of something awesome.</p>
<p>Listen, so things got pretty hot and heavy with you and Dee back in the day, correct?</p>
<p>That was over a year ago?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, she wasn't very nice to me.</p>
<p>So, what are we looking at?</p>
<p>No contact with Dee after you dated, or what's the deal here, bud?</p>
<p>Well, no. She, um...</p>
<p>She contacted me for a while.</p>
<p>Usually when she was drunk.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Drunken late-night booty calls?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>No. She usually just yells at me, calls me names, like army jerk, camo turkey.</p>
<p>I know she's just drunk, so it's okay.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Not okay. Not okay at all.</p>
<p>You got to stand up for yourself, man.</p>
<p>So, you haven't slept with her then?</p>
<p>Uh, sometimes she tricks me.</p>
<p>She tricks you?</p>
<p>She tricks you how?</p>
<p>(Voice breaking): To give her sex.</p>
<p>(Crying)</p>
<p>She's a very manipulative person.</p>
<p>(Crying continues)</p>
<p>Well, I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Are you guys mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: No, man, we're not mad...</p>
<p>No. I mean... you know... okay.</p>
<p>Get a grip, but...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, there's a room full of dudes out there, so you might want to... yeah.</p>
<p>Stop crying...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Before you come back out to the party.</p>
<p>Pull it together, because, you know, you're a soldier, and you should be tougher.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>This is the guy who's defending our country?</p>
<p>Well, he's definitely a candidate.</p>
<p>Oh, boys, the keg has arrived!</p>
<p>Hey, Frank, this power outlet is gonna explode, and you're gonna have to deal with that, okay?</p>
<p>Duncan, go with it, baby.</p>
<p>Yeah, let's go for it.</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Yo, Frank, we gonna set it off, bitch.</p>
<p>(Man imitates dog howling)</p>
<p>What are your bridge friends doing here?</p>
<p>Well, you got to give it the illusion of a party.</p>
<p>It's got to be a guy's night, that's why.</p>
<p>Are you high on blow?</p>
<p>Whatever Duncan gave me.</p>
<p>You don't even know what you're high on?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>(Mac sighs)</p>
<p><strong>Little Kev</strong>: Yo, Charlie chuckles, what's cracking, sunshine? Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hello, Kev.</p>
<p>Little Kev.</p>
<p>(Kevin mumbles)</p>
<p>And you here.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>I'll talk to you guys later.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>What is little Kev doing here?</p>
<p>Ell, you got to throw out a big net to catch the fish that she was banging.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Party!</p>
<p>(Cheering)</p>
<p>It's a party, yo.</p>
<p>Is that the bus boy from the Korean restaurant?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>She banged him.</p>
<p>(Sniffing)</p>
<p><em>Now, are you sure we're not taking this weekend at Bernie's thing too far?</p>
<p>'Cause I'm worried the sunglasses are ridiculous.</p>
<p>No. The sunglasses lighten the mood.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Make the whole thing feel like a fun, fun romp, you know?</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi, ladies. Hi. Yeah.</p>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Without the sunglasses, weekend at Bernie's would have been very dark.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Strange movie.</p>
<p>Very strange tale.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey there, Mr. Craig.</p>
<p>(Dens laughs)</p>
<p>Okay. Okay, the waving thing's awesome, that's true, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty sweet, right...?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, now, what's our plan here?</p>
<p>Are we just gonna throw him in the trash, or are we gonna find, like, a laundry shoot, fire him down that, or what are we doing?</p>
<p>What? No.</p>
<p>Just gonna drop him in one of these rooms if I can find an empty one.</p>
<p>No, but that way, somebody could find him and put him back in my room.</p>
<p>That's a good point.</p>
<p>Or maybe we could stuff him in a drawer, or, like, jam him in a closet or something.</p>
<p>That'll buy us some time, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Makes me feel like I have to touch him.</p>
<p>I don't want to touch him at all, so why don't we just put him in the trash?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Mr. Craig: Please don't put me in the trash!</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, are you alive?</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Whoa! What is going on here?</p>
<p>What are you doing with Mr.</p>
<p>Craig?</p>
<p>They're trying to put me in the trash.</p>
<p>Don't... no. Don't you...</p>
<p>Okay, you know what?</p>
<p>I flat-out refuse to share a room with an old man who likes to pretend to be dead.</p>
<p>He's a liar.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to move the patients.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>Oh, Dennis. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, I think I'm having this baby.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>Doctor!</p>
<p>Oh, it doesn't feel good.</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>
<p>This sucks a bag of dicks.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Oh, man! Oh!</p>
<p>Listen, help my sister.</p>
<p>Help my sister.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Don't leave me. I don't like it.</p>
<p>Okay. No, I'm coming.</p>
<p>We got you from here.</p>
<p>I'm coming with you.</p>
<p>We got you.</p>
<p>You ain't going nowhere.</p>
<p>You get your narrow ass back in that waiting room before I knock you in there.</p>
<p>You have done enough today.</p>
<p>Crazy ass white boy steadily dressing up folk and talking about Thor... oh.</p>
<p>I got you.</p>
<p>Wow. You know, this whole thing's really setting in now.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's really sinking in, man.</p>
<p>We're gonna have a baby.</p>
<p>This is really cool.</p>
<p>Please don't throw me in the trash.</p>
<p>No one's putting you in the trash.</p>
<p>Stop saying that.</p>
<p>Will you stop?</p>

<p>Man, I used to have some Jean shorts like that, too.</p>
<p>I slept in them shits, man.</p>
<p>Eventually, I blew the crotch out of them things, but you can't wear 'em every day and expect for 'em to hold up.</p>
<p>That was some nice ass denim, too.</p>
<p>I miss those shorts.</p>
<p>But you-you got to take 'em off every now and then.</p>
<p>Got to take 'em off, son.</p>
<p>So, I don't get it.</p>
<p>Why are you having sex with her?</p>
<p>Well, she gets drunk and calls me a cardio-jerk or a workout turkey, and after a while I just kind of cave in.</p>
<p>Wow, you just...</p>
<p>All right, I got to try that with someone.</p>
<p>Thanks, Rex.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you. Thanks, Rex.</p>
<p>Enjoy the party.</p>
<p>She's just berating these guys into having sex with her.</p>
<p>Yeah, and she is slammin' ass all over town.</p>
<p>She's getting way more action than us.</p>
<p>She's stu on her curse words...</p>
<p>"Jerk" and "turkey" are all that she's using.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, clearly they're working for her, 'cause Rex is a quality lay.</p>
<p>Yeah, re... all right, well, he's not to fit to be a father, though.</p>
<p>A father? No. None of these guys are fit to be fathers.</p>
<p>I mean, look at them, they're animals.</p>
<p>Even if we do figure out who it is, how are we gonna trust this baby with one of these monkeys?</p>
<p>No, look at them, they're animals...</p>
<p>They got no self-control.</p>
<p>You know, it takes discipline to raise a kid, you know?</p>
<p>You got to set rules, you got to set ground rules.</p>
<p>Set some boundaries.</p>
<p>You know, like, um, don't have 'em, like, doing cocaine, uh, get them off the Internet, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, the Internet is a very, very dangerous place.</p>
<p>Kids spend all their time on the Internet.</p>
<p>Hi. Who are you.</p>
<p>Oh, there's your penis and there's your butt.</p>
<p>You got to learn from someone books...</p>
<p>Give 'em some books.</p>
<p>Well, reading too many books...</p>
<p>Well, you don't want 'em to be a nerd.</p>
<p>You don't want 'em to be a nerd.</p>
<p>I am not raising a nerd, bro!</p>
<p>If it's a nerd, I'm gonna bash his head in.</p>
<p>Nerds get nowhere in life.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, is he a nerd?</p>
<p>I could bash some nerds right now.</p>
<p>Well, right after this we should probably bash nerds.</p>
<p>I got to get it out of my system.</p>
<p>Bash some nerds.</p>
<p>(Exhales): Absolutely.</p>
<p>Do you know what, you got to teach him how to beat nerds up.</p>
<p>He's got to be beating nerds up.</p>
<p>I feel we have a lot of ideas about raising a kid.</p>
<p>We are men who can be great dads, we have great opinions...</p>
<p>Yeah, and that's all that parenting is.</p>
<p>Pretending you know what you're talking about and then jamming it down a kid's throat.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, that's what we're gonna do.</p>
<p>When I see that baby, dude, we're gonna run towards it, I'm gonna grab it, I'm gonna pick him up...</p>
<p>And jam shit down his throat!</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>Dude, we're gonna be the dad.</p>
<p>We're so much better dads than these guys.</p>
<p>I mean, look.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</p>
<p>Oh... (Chuckles)</p>
<p>(Laughing)</p>
<p>I can't wait to tell him.</p>
<p>I can't believe this.</p>
<p>This is so exciting.</p>
<p>There he is.</p>
<p>Hey, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis, we have news, we have wonderful news.</p>
<p>Charlie and I have decided that we are going to be the father of this child.</p>
<p>Dude, we did a complete 180.</p>
<p>You know what, you guys, I did a 180, too.</p>
<p>I totally did.</p>
<p>I was all pissy this morning about how I'm gonna be at the hospital, and then I was thinking about it, and I realized I've been firing on all cylinders because of this baby thing.</p>
<p><em>Dude, I did this weekend at Bernie's operation earlier that</em> would have blown you guys' mind...</p>
<p>It was very effective.</p>
<p>And then I busted out this "sweet Thor" line on this lady, 'cause she was pissing me off, and it was, like, boom!</p>
<p>I mean, I really hit her with it...</p>
<p>And I never reference the nordic gods.</p>
<p>What are you saying, though?</p>
<p>'Cause I don't understand what your point is.</p>
<p>I'm saying I want to be the dad, too...</p>
<p>I'm totally into it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, that steps on our thing a little bit, but...</p>
<p>Yeah, 'cause we were doing <em>the... you know, maybe instead of doing a my two dads type thing, we could fold in another dad and do a three men and a baby type situation.</p>
<p>Three men and a baby...</p>
<p>That's what it is. I like that.</em></p>
<p>An equally effective movie, right?</p>
<p>A great movie.</p>
<p>Did we miss it?</p>
<p>Did we miss it?</p>
<p>No. It was...</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Who are all these people?</p>
<p>Oh! I couldn't decide who the dad was, so I brought everybody.</p>
<p>You didn't even try and decide who the dad was, you just got high!</p>
<p>(Grunts) Well, the interrogation did turn into a coke party.</p>
<p>But they all promised to have blood tests.</p>
<p>Uh! If this kid is mine, I'm gonna blow my brains out.</p>
<p>Ah. Oh, he got zooted, man.</p>
<p>He took an eight-ball to the dome.</p>
<p>No, no, Frank, dude, get these guys out of here, all right?</p>
<p><em>We're gonna be the father of the baby now.</em></p>
<p>Yes, we're gonna be the fathers.</p>
<p>It has been decided.</p>
<p>So sayeth Thor.</p>
<p>Thor said it.</p>
<p>Tho-who?</p>
<p>Thor.</p>
<p>Who Thor?</p>
<p>Is that your Greek God reference?</p>
<p>He's a nordic God.</p>
<p>Nordic God.</p>
<p>No, I said something else earlier that was it sounded a lot cooler than that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That one didn't really work.</p>
<p>Guys! Guys, here she comes.</p>
<p>She's coming.</p>
<p>How do we make it a big moment?</p>
<p>I want to make it a big moment, you know?</p>
<p>With music!</p>
<p>Duncan, play something special.</p>
<p>Frank, I got the perfect thing.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>(Gentle piano intro playing)</p>
<p>♪ Ah, ha, ooh... ooh, ooh ah, ha, ah...</p>
<p>♪ ooh... ah, ha, ah... ooh, ooh..</p>
<p>♪ Pray God you can cope I stand outside this woman's work ♪ this woman's world ooh, it's hard on the man now his part is over ♪ now starts the craft of the father I know you have a little life ♪ in you yet I know you have a lot... ♪</p>
<p>Carmen?</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm here to get my baby.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, the tranny's the dad.</p>
<p>(Laughing, whooping)</p>
<p>You had sex with a tranny?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I was their surrogate.</p>
<p>We used, uh, her sperm and a donor egg, and then they just kind of... (Raspberry) Right up there and...</p>
<p>We had a difficult time finding a surrogate, but Dee here was a miracle to us.</p>
<p>See, I can't have kids of my and Carmen always wanted...</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, great, great, miracle for you.</p>
<p>How wonderful.</p>
<p>Dee, you tricked us?</p>
<p>How did I trick you?</p>
<p>Well, we were getting all pumped up about being this baby's dad.</p>
<p>We were all keyed up for nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah. If we knew you were doing this stupid surrogate thing again, we would have just completely ignored your pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>You did ignore my pregnancy!</em></p>
<p>This has been a huge disappointment for us.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We were gonna be great dads.</p>
<p>We were gonna impose our will on the kid.</p>
<p><em>We had a three men and a baby thing going on!</p>
<p>Oh, okay, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I have to admit, this whole thing might be for the best.</p>
<p>I mean, those two are gonna make great parents, much better parents than any of us would, don't you think?</p>
<p>Yeah. I guess.</p>
<p>You know, a baby would've screwed up our chemistry, right?</p>
<p>It might've.</p>
<p>It might've, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got a good thing going...</p>
<p>Why blow it with a baby?</p>
<p>Yeah, that being said, don't get knocked up anymore, Dee...</p>
<p>It's getting old.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, no, no, I didn't enjoy any of it.</p>
<p>So, what I'm confused on is, the mother is the father and the father is black and the baby's not black, so...</p>
<p>It's all been explained.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I'll talk you through it later.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Then what is your deal?</p>
<p>Do we pop you back in there, or are you done having babies, or what's going on ...</p>
<p>Yeah, can you take me to go get a beer?</p>
<p>'Cause I need a beer.</p>
<p>Ooh, cool, I could go for a beer.</p>
<p>You guys want to go back to the bar?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Hey, you guys, let's bring the party back to the bar.</p>
<p>Bring the music. Let's go.</p>
<p>What the hell's happening back there?</p>
<p>A few buddies came along.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, Dee.</p>
<p>Oh! Let's party in the sewer!</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Charlie!</p>
<p>I'm not going into a sewer.</p>
<p>What is your obsession with the sewer these days?</p>
<p>You find a lot of great stuff down there.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Like sewage.</p>
<p>Ha-ha! Good gone, Dee!</p>
<p>She's back, baby, she's back!</p>
<p>No, no, suppose there's a storm and a guy loses his ring...</p>
<p>Oh, my God, is this the ring story again?</p>
<p>I'm getting real tired of the ring story.</p>
<p>You got to come up with something else, Frank.</p>
<p>You can't keep using the same...</p>
<p>Like, give me some crack.</p>
<p>You know what I'm saying, dawg?</p>
<p>We'll get more, we'll get more.</em></p>
