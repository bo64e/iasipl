<p>Hey, come on bro. Swim time.</p>
<p>It's a heat wave! Heat wave!</p>
<p>Sorry about that, can I help you?</p>
<p>Dude, checking in for the pool.</p>
<p>Check us in.</p>
<p>Sorry sir, you can't bring beer under the premises.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You can't drink in this pool?</p>
<p>That's kind of weird.</p>
<p>Charlie, chop this, we'll just have to finish these out here.</p>
<p>Why don't you help us out?</p>
<p>No, I'm good.</p>
<p>More for us. You sure?</p>
<p>I'm sure, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I'm going to assume you guys aren't members here.</p>
<p>You know what, why don't you just go ahead and sign us up.</p>
<p>We'll blaze through these in no time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, if you'd like to join our swim club, you need to be sponsored by two existing members.</p>
<p>But I'm sorry to tell you, fellas, that membership is currently at capacity.</p>
<p>At capacity?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We're in the middle of a terrible heat wave and you happen to be at capacity for us.</p>
<p>Well, you can try the public pool, but I should...</p>
<p>(belching): Well, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>We're out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>(bleep) you.</p>
<p>You don't have to...</p>
<p>Oh, sir!</p>
<p>I cannot believe that that just happened.</p>
<p>In this day and age, dude.</p>
<p>I know, I can't believe there's such a big list.</p>
<p>Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Don't you get it, dude?</p>
<p>They'll always be "at capacity" for us.</p>
<p>I don't get that at all.</p>
<p>Is that what he said?</p>
<p>Don't you get it?</p>
<p>We got big-timed, dude.</p>
<p>He called us lower-class.</p>
<p>He called us lower-class?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wouldn't argue with that, dude.</p>
<p>We're definitely lower-class.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not disputing that fact, dude.</p>
<p>I'm saying we shouldn't get boxed out for it.</p>
<p>It's bullshit.</p>
<p>Honestly, I just want to go swimming.</p>
<p>(belches)</p>
<p>Should we suck it up and go to the public pool?</p>
<p>Ugh, gross, dude.</p>
<p>I will not go to that disgusting public pool.</p>
<p>People there are gross.</p>
<p>I got a good idea.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>There she is, this is what I'm talking about bro.</p>
<p>Man, the old diving pool, remember how much fun we used to have here?</p>
<p>You know it's all "Deep End".</p>
<p>Hell yeah we had fun dude, you know why?</p>
<p>Because this was a pool for people like us, street guys!</p>
<p>And I think it's clear why it looks like shit now.</p>
<p>Well yeah, cause Jamie Nelson drown in it.</p>
<p>What ? No.</p>
<p>I was gonna say it was because of a pattern of discrimination.</p>
<p>Because this is a pool for lower class people.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, look dude.</p>
<p>I say it's time we take matters into our own hands with this.</p>
<p>What you thinking?</p>
<p>I'm saying we're fixing up this pool.</p>
<p>Man, I'm going to have to keep tinkering with the A.C., 'cause I can't feel it at all.</p>
<p>Can you feel it?</p>
<p>Look, Charlie, you got to focus, okay?</p>
<p>A pool is a major investment.</p>
<p>So if we're going to get Frank on board with this, we have to approach him as equals.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now is that why you got that gold chain?</p>
<p>That's why I got the gold chain.</p>
<p>All right, okay.</p>
<p>I see what you're going after here.</p>
<p>Hey, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>Hey, we have a little bit of a presentation for you.</p>
<p>Can you come down?</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>What's with the sheet?</p>
<p>Not just yet, okay?</p>
<p>Please, have a seat.</p>
<p>Charlie, get Frank a beer.</p>
<p>(Charlie imitating airplane)</p>
<p>Don't do airplane noises.</p>
<p>Just give him the beer.</p>
<p>Good move.</p>
<p><strong>Dee</strong>: Why don't we get beers?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you're not even supposed to be here, okay?</p>
<p>Frank is the audience.</p>
<p>So just keep your mouths shut.</p>
<p>Sheet, sheet, sheet.</p>
<p>Okay, ready.</p>
<p>Hey-ho here we go!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Pool!</p>
<p>Charlie and I found this abandoned pool that we used to swim in when we were kids.</p>
<p>It's, like, full of, like, all sorts of branches and shit...</p>
<p>It's a mess, it's a big mess.</p>
<p>If we have a little bit of money, we can clean it up, and then we can... - Pass.</p>
<p>Well, just let me finish.</p>
<p>I have a whole thing of...</p>
<p>Pass.</p>
<p>It's too much work.</p>
<p>What else you got?</p>
<p>So you guys are still all pissed off about not getting into that swim club?</p>
<p>Look, if you guys were there, you would know how we feel.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Stop yourself right there.</p>
<p>See, we would not know how it feels, 'cause Dee and I would have waltzed right into that swim club.</p>
<p>Yeah, you don't lump Dennis and me in with you.</p>
<p>We're... We're high-class, so...</p>
<p>You should have seen this guy.</p>
<p>He would have lumped the shit out of you.</p>
<p>Dennis, we live in the same apartment.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you guys a little something about how class works.</p>
<p>You're born into class.</p>
<p>It's about pedigree, it's about upbringing.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with your present circumstances.</p>
<p>No. See, Dennis and I were born upper-class, and therefore we currently are, and will forever remain, upper-class.</p>
<p>Frank, stop picking your teeth for one second.</p>
<p>And back us up on this.</p>
<p>Look, I quit on that shit.</p>
<p>You understand?</p>
<p>I quit on it.</p>
<p>I don't give a rat's ass about class.</p>
<p>I live on the fringe.</p>
<p>Fringe class is where I am.</p>
<p>Okay, great, you're in the fringe class.</p>
<p>I still maintain that Dee and I are in the upper class.</p>
<p>But, you know, all this talk has really gotten me thinking about taking a dip.</p>
<p>I'm hot as shit, Dee.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We could go pop a hydrant.</p>
<p>We'd beat the heat that way.</p>
<p>I'm not popping shit.</p>
<p>That's about as low-class as it gets. Dee?</p>
<p>Swim club.</p>
<p>Swim club.</p>
<p>Later, bitches.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Sorry, sir, we are at capacity.</p>
<p>Capacity?</p>
<p>That is unbelievable that you would use the word capacity with us.</p>
<p>We truly could not admit you, even if you had the sponsors, which you don't.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we know you.</p>
<p>You could sponsor us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know what kind of idea you have about us, but we, sir, are like you.</p>
<p>Uh, send a little something sweet his way maybe.</p>
<p>Oh, a little sweetness, huh?</p>
<p>Want a little something sweet?</p>
<p>All right, if that's the only language he understands...</p>
<p>Sir, please, you're just embarrassing yourself now.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm embarrassing?</p>
<p>I'm embarrassing myself?</p>
<p>Said the elitist pool guy.</p>
<p>You know, what, Dee, I don't even think I'd want to be a part of some exclusionary pool club, propagated by this man... This hate monger.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I'm with you.</p>
<p>I bet you don't even have any black people here.</p>
<p>Excuse me, ma'am, but there is an African-American family right there.</p>
<p>Oh, well, good for you.</p>
<p>You keep a couple of token ones around, do you?</p>
<p>Parade 'em around like dancing monkeys?</p>
<p>Right... Oh, no... That's not...</p>
<p>I didn't mean it like that.</p>
<p>Monkeys?</p>
<p>It's a phrase that means...</p>
<p>It's a phrase.</p>
<p>Performing on command?</p>
<p>Listen, listen, you are more than happy to try the public pool.</p>
<p>Oh, can we?</p>
<p>Well, maybe we will.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we have class.</p>
<p>And having class means being able to mix with people that are beneath you.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Your shirt doesn't even fit, by the way.</p>
<p>If you want to be an elitist, get yourself a tailor.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, Dee, that's...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Severely lacking in class.</p>
<p>Too much? My bad.</p>
<p>Got carried away.</p>
<p>Oh, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This is like a goddamn zoo.</p>
<p>Uh, there's a very disturbing lack of adults here.</p>
<p>That girl just jumped in with her sneakers on.</p>
<p>These people all have sneakers on.</p>
<p>All right, you know what's happening here?</p>
<p>We're just experiencing a little bit of culture shock.</p>
<p>These people are very different from the people that are at our normal pool environment, and this whole environment is very difficult.</p>
<p>And that's OK, it's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Dennis, Deandra!</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I tried to pop a hydrant, but there was no lookout, so I got shut down.</p>
<p>I see that you have a towel.</p>
<p>Where did you get that?</p>
<p>I don't see any attendants around here.</p>
<p>Oh, I, uh, I bartered fringe style with that guy over there.</p>
<p>I gave him a bite of my hot dog, he's letting me use his towel.</p>
<p>Want a bite?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yo, Mac.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Hey, dude, I think this right here has got "keeper pile" written all over it.</p>
<p>We could probably set some of this up strategically to kinda represent where all the cool shit in the pool's gonna be.</p>
<p>Like, you know, this rusty bike frame?</p>
<p>We could be, like, "That's where the swim-up bar is."</p>
<p>Swim-up bar!</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That's good, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a whole plan, like, we'll dip one of those cans with the string on it into the water, and when we're underwater, we'll place our order, you know?</p>
<p>Two beers, please.</p>
<p>And when we swim up to the top, Dennis hands them to us.</p>
<p>Eh, well, I was sort of thinking we'd be at capacity for Dennis, but I guess if he's serving us, then that makes him lower than us, so that's cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, he'll be lower than us.</p>
<p>Don't worry about that.</p>
<p>I don't want to put a tin can in the water, though, with a string, you know, because we're not eight.</p>
<p>I just thought it'd be cool to put it in your ear, you put it in your mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that's not cool, but...</p>
<p>Well, it's classy.</p>
<p>Yeah, neither.</p>
<p>All right, well, you want to pop down here and help me chuck this mattress out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's kind of like the last big thing I got.</p>
<p>Yeah, we'll get all of this out of here.</p>
<p>Ooh, God, dude, it's really squishy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's covered in chlorine water, but it's, you know, it's clean.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know there hasn't been chlorine in here since Jamie Nelson, but it's probably like raw sewage that's been sitting in here.</p>
<p>Uh... Uh, yeah, it's got a sewagey smell.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right.</p>
<p>Let's just chuck it out.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Yeah, let's get it out of here.</p>
<p>All right, give it a boost.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: One, two, three.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: Yay!</p>
<p>Whoo! I'm strong, dude.</p>
<p>I'm definitely the one who's stronger.</p>
<p>Whoo!</p>
<p>Wow, dude, this pool is sweet, man.</p>
<p>It's super deep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, dude, um, how have you been getting in and out of here?</p>
<p>I was climbing up the mattress.</p>
<p>Sort of like a ladder-type situation.</p>
<p>Oh, shit!</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Are we stuck in here?</p>
<p>I think we're stuck.</p>
<p>Help! Help!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Come on, man!</p>
<p>I can't even make out an angle to do a lap or anything.</p>
<p>Ow! Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>What? What?</p>
<p>I just stepped on broken glass!</p>
<p>Ow! Oh, my God, there's shards of broken glass all over the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>Well, now I know why people are wearing shoes.</p>
<p>Yeah, now the shoes make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Okay, Frank, what in the hell are you doing with that watermelon, man?</p>
<p>You ever play this game?</p>
<p>You grease the watermelon up, you throw it in the pool, everybody goes crazy trying to grab it!</p>
<p>They can't grab it!</p>
<p>Greased watermelon!</p>
<p>Here it comes! Try to grab it!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Ugh, I can't believe you borrowed hot dog guy's towel.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>Listen, I have a proposition.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a proposition, too : let me walk in front of you so you don't get your blood all over my feet.</p>
<p>That's fair.</p>
<p>Hey, why don't we call Mac and Charlie?</p>
<p>I just feel like their pool has gotta be better than this.</p>
<p>No, we don't want them to know that we didn't get into the private swim club.</p>
<p>Oh, son of a bitch!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Which one of you little shits stole my shoes?!</p>
<p>Goddamn it!</p>
<p>I'm putting out a feeler call.</p>
<p>Stride, stride, stride, stride, execute!</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! Okay, I think I see what the problem is, though.</p>
<p>This move is intended for a back flip.</p>
<p>And what I need to do is a front flip.</p>
<p>Now if you needed a back flip, I'd be up that wall in a second.</p>
<p>No, you just wouldn't, because you don't know how to do a back flip.</p>
<p>Charlie, I do back flips every single day of my life.</p>
<p>No you don't, I have never seen...</p>
<p>Do a back flip right now please Can I see one? Let's see one.</p>
<p>I need to stay focused, and conserve energy.</p>
<p>(Charlie imitating Mac)</p>
<p>What if I need to do a back flip later?</p>
<p>You need to do some kind of flip now and you don't know how.</p>
<p>Cause you don't know how to flip, or do karate.</p>
<p>All you know what to do is talk me into doing shit, where I get stuck in a pool.</p>
<p>Where I'm definitely gonna die.</p>
<p>Oh wait, my phone's ringing.</p>
<p>You've had a cellphone this entire time?</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Hello ? Charlie, hey Dennis and I...</p>
<p>No, leave my name out of it.</p>
<p>It's Dee and Dennis dude, they'll rescue us.</p>
<p>No, do not tell them that we're stuck in here.</p>
<p>Because getting stuck in an abandoned pool is extremely low class.</p>
<p>Dennis will sink his teeth into it.</p>
<p>Ooh, I feel like if I talk to him, it's gonna kind of slip out.</p>
<p>Just don't let it slip out.</p>
<p>But I kind of want to tell him.</p>
<p>Oh my God! Just give me the phone.</p>
<p>It's Mac. How is it going over there in your deserted mine shaft or whatever?</p>
<p>Oh, it's pretty sweet here, okay?</p>
<p>It's very private.</p>
<p>Probably way more private than your piece of shit pool.</p>
<p>Really? (Chuckles)</p>
<p>I doubt that, you know.</p>
<p>Is that Mexican music?</p>
<p>Uh, the music.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, it's, it's...</p>
<p>You know what it is?</p>
<p>It's one of the attendants.</p>
<p>He's walking around with a ghetto blaster serving us drinks and just making us comfortable, giving us hats.</p>
<p>Why does it sound so echoey over there?</p>
<p>Nothing but relaxation going on over here, you know?</p>
<p>It's very relaxey.</p>
<p>We're stuck in the pool!</p>
<p>And that's probably what you're hearing is the, is the relaxation.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, those are my shoes!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Uh, the attendant, you know, he just walked off with my shoes, and ooh, it made me mad because he didn't ask.</p>
<p>But, but... But, but it's great because, in the end, I'm gonna end up with polished shoes.</p>
<p>You know how it goes.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>Damn it, dude!</p>
<p>That private pool's awesome!</p>
<p>They have attendants!</p>
<p>Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Who's in attendance?</p>
<p>How many people?</p>
<p>No, she didn't say anything...</p>
<p>No, people that wait on them hand and foot.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, really?</p>
<p>Yes. Oh, my God, all right.</p>
<p>Dude, since when do you have a cell phone?</p>
<p>I buy 'em all the time now, you know?</p>
<p>You prepay for it, and then you buy it and you throw it away.</p>
<p>There's a name for it.</p>
<p>A burner?</p>
<p>A burner! That's a burner.</p>
<p>Dude, this is what drug dealers buy.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>This is a very specific sect of lower class, okay?</p>
<p>This is like, this is, like, felon class.</p>
<p>Felon class, huh?</p>
<p>God! All right, okay, so, let me see.</p>
<p>Who are we gonna call?</p>
<p>We can't call the police, right, because...</p>
<p>No, we're trespassing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, I got an idea!</p>
<p>Let's order some food!</p>
<p>Oh-oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Then we have the delivery guy come, and he can help us out.</p>
<p>Perfect. And we can get some Chinese food 'cause that's the classiest poolside food you can have.</p>
<p>Yeah, we probably shouldn't get Chinese, though, because those delivery guys are always Chinese, and he won't understand a word we're saying and plus, he's probably gonna be too short.</p>
<p>Ooh...</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I could really go for some Chinese food, though, man.</p>
<p>That'd be good.</p>
<p>But we're not actually eating the food, so...</p>
<p>I'm gonna eat the food, for sure.</p>
<p>I'm starving.</p>
<p>Okay, you know what, dude?</p>
<p>Let me handle it, all right?</p>

<p>I'm gonna call...</p>
<p>I'm gonna call pizza delivery.</p>
<p>Pizza, we're gonna get some pizza.</p>
<p>It'll be some big Italian lug and he'll fish us out of here.</p>
<p>Fish sounds good.</p>
<p>Yeah, see if they have fish there.</p>
<p>I'll ask.</p>
<p>This place is a shit hole.</p>
<p>I motion for Mac and Charlie's pool.</p>
<p>It just didn't sound like it was that bad over there.</p>
<p>Look, there's absolutely no way in hell I'm letting Mac and Charlie know that we didn't get into that swim club.</p>
<p>(clattering)</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Ow! What the hell?!</p>
<p>What? What happened?</p>
<p>What was that?!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That's a rock, Dennis.</p>
<p>These kid are throwing rocks at each other for fun.</p>
<p>I mean, what kind of savages throw rocks at each other to have fun times?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I am done with this place.</p>
<p>I'm done with it.</p>
<p>We need to take another run at that swim club.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we better before I lose it and I drown a child!</p>
<p>Here. Here you go.</p>
<p>We ate the watermelon.</p>
<p>(chuckles) Butter me up.</p>
<p>I'm gonna be the watermelon and jump in the pool.</p>
<p>Do my back; I can't do my back.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>(grunting and laughing)</p>
<p>Get ready for a rock in the eye, bro.</p>
<p>Ahh!</p>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>(groans): Oh!</p>
<p>Oh, no!</p>
<p>Ow! That one really hurt.</p>
<p>That really hurt.</p>
<p>Truce, truce, truce, truce!</p>
<p>No more throwing rocks, right?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Hello? Eh!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>You guys ordered a pizza?</p>
<p>You got to be kidding me, He's Chinese His English sounds pretty good, so...</p>
<p>And he's kind of big, too.</p>
<p>Hey, we're stuck in this pool, dude... Can you help us out?</p>
<p>Is this a prank?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Look, dude, dude, dude, look We'll pay you first, all right?</p>
<p>And then just help us out of here.</p>
<p>Charlie, you got some cash?</p>
<p>Uh... No. shit.</p>
<p>Check your front pockets.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Well, no, I cut them off, 'cause they're overshooting the bottom of my shorts.</p>
<p>Forget it, I'm out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, wait!</p>
<p>Hey, we'll give you a gold chain.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Toss it up.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here you go. Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, toss that pizza down, too, man; I'm starving.</p>
<p>Yeah, might as well.</p>
<p>I haven't eaten.</p>
<p>Oh, no, dude!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Hey, bro, why don't you just toss down that hose, then you can pull us up.</p>
<p>See that hose right there?</p>
<p>That'd be good, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>Oh, that's perfect.</p>
<p>That's perfect.</p>
<p>Hey! Hey, this change is fake as shit, man.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, dude.</p>
<p>He's white trash.</p>
<p>Don't take it personally.</p>
<p>Don't take it personally!</p>
<p>Forget it, I'm out of here.</p>
<p>(Mac and Charlie shouting)</p>
<p>Don't go!</p>
<p>All right, whatever.</p>
<p>No problem, no problem.</p>
<p>You can just climb it, right?</p>
<p>I'm just going to climb right up it.</p>
<p>Okay, stand back 'cause it takes a real man to do this.</p>
<p>You ready, bro?</p>
<p>(Charlie and Mac yelling)</p>
<p>Oh, man!</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Oh, dude!</p>
<p>All right, that's it.</p>
<p>I'm calling Dennis.</p>
<p>No, don't you understand?</p>
<p>This pool is our bootstraps and it's lifting us up Into the middle class, dude.</p>
<p>Just accept the fact that you're white trash.</p>
<p>Take a look at yourself, you can't do back flips.</p>
<p>You don't know karate, you're white trash!</p>
<p>You're white trash too, dude, look at those shorts are white trash Do not call those shorts white trash.</p>
<p>Dennis told me about these shorts and they're not white trash.</p>
<p>Look at this. Look what I can do.</p>
<p>What is white trash about that?</p>
<p>Don't call me white trash.</p>
<p>I feel if I had that kind of mobility, I'd be capable of pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe then you could get the flip.</p>
<p>Although I doubt it, I really doubt it.</p>
<p>Can we just call Dennis?</p>

<p>We just need two sponsors and we'll get in, don't worry.</p>

<p>Oh, it's a terrific heat wave, and I'll tell you what, it's affecting everybody.</p>
<p>It really is, and we're looking to cool down a little bit.</p>
<p>We thought this pool, that'd be a great place for us to cool off.</p>

<p>He did like skateboarding.</p>
<p>Not much of a swimmer.</p>
<p>Not a very good swimmer.</p>
<p>No. No, he wasn't.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I think we can both agree that we need to make sure that his spirit does not haunt us.</p>
<p>Yes, definitely want to ward off his spirit, so, if you know any...</p>
<p>Okay. Shall we join hands?</p>
<p>You know, voodoo or whatever, go ahead and...</p>

<p>DEE &amp; DENNIS: What?!</p>
<p>Oh, my God, you sons of bitches!</p>
<p>You didn't get in.</p>
<p>Admit that you were low class just like us.</p>
<p>I'm not admitting shit because I did get into that pool.</p>
<p>I just got tired of swimming in it.</p>
<p>All right, then why are you here?</p>
<p>Why are you piping in trash?</p>
<p>You shut your mouth, trash.</p>
<p>Why are you calling me trash?</p>
<p>I defended you earlier 'cause of these shorts.</p>
<p>You are the ones that are trash!</p>
<p>Sitting in the bottom of a pool that's filled with trash, like trash.</p>
<p>You guys are white trash!</p>
<p>You admit it right now!</p>
<p>Oh! I hope you trash bags die at the bottom of this pool like Jamie Nelson did.</p>
